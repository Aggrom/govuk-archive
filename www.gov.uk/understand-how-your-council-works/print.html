<p>This guide relates to councils in England. Find information about councils in <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government" title="The Scottish Government: Local government" rel="external">Scotland,</a> <a href="http://wales.gov.uk/topics/localgovernment" title="Welsh Government: Local government" rel="external">Wales</a> and <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/local%E2%80%91government" title="nidirect: Local government" rel="external">Northern Ireland.</a></p>

<p>Many parts of England have 2 tiers of local government: </p>

<ul>
<li>county councils</li>
  <li>district, borough or city councils</li>
</ul>
<p>In some parts of the country, there’s just one tier of local government providing all the functions, known as a ‘unitary authority’. This can be a city, borough or county council - or it may just be called ‘council’.</p>

<p>As well as these, many areas also have parish or town councils. </p>

<h2>County councils</h2>
<p>These are responsible for services across the whole of a county, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>education</li>
  <li>transport</li>
  <li>planning</li>
  <li>fire and public safety</li>
  <li>social care</li>
  <li>libraries</li>
  <li>waste management</li>
  <li>trading standards</li>
</ul>
<h2>District, borough and city councils</h2>
<p>These cover a smaller area than county councils. They’re usually responsible for services like:</p>

<ul>
<li>rubbish collection</li>
  <li>recycling</li>
  <li>Council Tax collections</li>
  <li>housing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unitary authorities</h2>
<p>In some parts of the country, one tier of local government provides all the local services listed above.</p>

<h2>Parish, community and town councils</h2>
<p>These operate at a level below district and borough councils and in some cases, unitary authorities. They’re elected and can help on a number of local issues, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>planning applications</li>
  <li>running sports grounds</li>
  <li>running community halls</li>
</ul></article><article id="decision-making"><header><h1>Part 2: Decision making</h1>
  </header><p>The full council (a meeting of all council members) is responsible for all decisions. But in practice, most of the work is given to smaller groups of councillors or council officers (paid staff).</p>

<p>Every council must publish:</p>

<ul>
<li>details of when key decisions will be taken</li>
  <li>papers of meetings – at least 5 working days beforehand</li>
  <li>minutes of meetings – showing the decisions that were made</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view council meeting agendas, minutes and reports on <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">your council’s website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also attend most council meetings, although usually you won’t be able to speak at them.</p>

<h2>Mayors</h2>
<p>Many councils have a civic mayor or chairman of the council. They carry out ceremonial duties and chair meetings, but can’t make decisions about council business.</p>

<p>Some councils have an elected mayor. They’re responsible for the day-to-day running of local services. </p>

<p>Councils can have both elected and civic mayors.</p>

</article><article id="spending-and-accounts"><header><h1>Part 3: Spending and accounts</h1>
  </header><p>Many <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local councils</a> provide information on their websites to show how they spend their budget.</p>

<p>You can view details of:</p>

<ul>
<li>payments for goods and services over £500</li>
  <li>contracts and tenders over £500</li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking at annual accounts</h2>
<p>Every year councils must open their detailed financial accounts to the public for 20 working days. </p>

<p>This allows you to check any spending under £500 without having to <a href="/make-a-freedom-of-information-request" title="Make a freedom of information request">make a freedom of information request</a>.</p>

<p>Your council must publish on its website and in the local press details of when you can check its accounts.</p>

</article><article id="local-councillors"><header><h1>Part 4: Local councillors</h1>
  </header><p>Local councillors are elected by the local community to represent its views.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.writetothem.com/" title="Contact your councillor, MP or AM">contact your local councillor online</a> or by going to an advice surgery. </p>

<h2>Declaring interests</h2>
<p>All local councillors have to declare any interests, gifts or hospitality they get that could influence decisions they make. </p>

<p>Your local council must publish details of these. You can usually access them on your council’s website or at the town hall.</p>

</article><article id="make-a-complaint"><header><h1>Part 5: Make a complaint</h1>
  </header><p>If you feel that a council service hasn’t been properly delivered, you can make an official complaint.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="/complain-about-your-council" title="Complain about your local council">Complain to the council service provider</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re still not happy, complain to your council’s complaints officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this doesn’t resolve the issue, you may be able to get the <a href="http://www.lgo.org.uk/" title="Local Government Ombudsman" rel="external">Local Government Ombudsman</a> to look into it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ombudsman considers complaints if you’ve suffered because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the way a council service has been given</li>
  <li>how a decision has been made</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ombudsman usually only considers your complaint once it’s been through your local council’s complaints procedure.</p>
