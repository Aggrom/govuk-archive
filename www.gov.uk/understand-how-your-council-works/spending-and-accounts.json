This can be a city, borough or county council - or it may just be called \u2018council\u2019.\r\n\r\nAs well as these, many areas also have parish or town councils. \r\n\r\n##County councils\r\nThese are responsible for services across the whole of a county, like:\r\n\r\n+ education\r\n+ transport\r\n+ planning\r\n+ fire and public safety\r\n+ social care\r\n+ libraries\r\n+ waste management\r\n+ trading standards\r\n\r\n##District, borough and city councils\r\nThese cover a smaller area than county councils.
