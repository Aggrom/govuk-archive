<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Good design and manufacturing processes are essential to ensure you meet these technical and legal requirements.Â They can also give your business a competitive edge and save costs.</p>

<p>This guide sets out the key safety, design, packaging and insurance issues you need to consider in relation to your products.</p>

<h2 id="your-legal-responsibilities">Your legal responsibilities</h2>

<p>Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, all products must be âfit for purposeâ, be of satisfactory quality and fit its description. This means that your products must fulfil the purpose the customer has been led to expect and the reasons that led them to buy it.</p>

<p>The Act also covers any purpose that a customer asks about when the product is purchased and is guaranteed by the retailer to meet that purpose when it is sold. If a product is not fit for purpose, the customer is within their rights to have the goods replaced or repaired.</p>

<p>You can find <a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/business-advice/treating-customers-fairly/sogahome/">Sale of Goods Act guidance on the Office of Fair Trading (<abbr title="Office of Fair Trading">OFT</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>By definition, good design will lead to safe design. While meeting your legal obligations is the minimum required, it is a good idea to go further and take best practice on board throughout the design, production, supply and disposal stages.</p>

<p>As a manufacturer or supplier you could be held liable in any legal action for harm caused to consumers or businesses as a result of unintended side-effects or the failure of products manufactured or supplied by you.</p>

<p>Your manufacturing and processing systems must comply with environmental law. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/netregs/">read guidance to help you keep up with your environmental responsibilities on the NetRegs website</a>.</p>

<p>See this guide on <a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/specialist/ce-marking?cachebust=1349356376&amp;preview=7133"><abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking</a>.</p>

<h2 id="products-covered-by-specific-safety-regulations">Products covered by specific safety regulations</h2>

<p>A <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark is a manufacturerâs claim that its product meets specified essential safety requirements set out in relevant European directives.</p>

<p>Certain categories of products must bear <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking if you intend to sell them in:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>member states of the European Economic area (<abbr title="European Economic area">EEA</abbr>) - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway</li>
</ul>
<p>The following categories of products require <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking if you wish to sell them within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or member states of the <abbr title="European Economic area">EEA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>toys</li>
  <li>electrical products</li>
  <li>construction products</li>
  <li>pressure vessels</li>
  <li>telecommunications equipment</li>
  <li>medical devices</li>
  <li>machinery, equipment and safety components</li>
  <li>personal protective equipment</li>
  <li>satellite station equipment</li>
  <li>gas appliances</li>
  <li>pressure equipment</li>
  <li>appliances (other than gas)</li>
  <li>non-automatic weighing instruments and equipment</li>
  <li>measuring instruments</li>
  <li>recreational craft</li>
  <li>lift machinery</li>
  <li>equipment and protective systems for explosive atmospheres</li>
  <li>in-vitro diagnostic medical devices</li>
  <li>marine equipment</li>
  <li>safety components and subsystems for incorporation into cableway installations</li>
  <li>cableway equipment (ski tows etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirement for <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking and the exact process you will need to go through varies from product to product. Different types of product are governed by different European directives. For example, the trade of certain machinery, equipment and safety components is governed by the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008. The regulations implement a European directive aimed at removing technical barriers to trade.</p>

<p>Under the regulations, products that conform to the relevant safety standards are <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marked and can be placed on the market across the <abbr title="European Economic area">EEA</abbr>. Responsibility for ensuring compliance with the regulations rests with the manufacturer of the machinery, equipment or components in question. Failure to do so can result in prosecution.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file52968.pdf">Download guidance on the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations (PDF, 424KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Where an item of equipment is covered by more than one directive, it must be <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marked under all applicable directives.</p>

<p>If you supply consumer products which arenât covered by these specific directives, they must not be <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marked. However, you still have a general duty to ensure they are safe for normal or reasonably foreseeable use under the General Product Safety Regulations 2005.</p>

<p>You can also see this guide on <a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/specialist/ce-marking?cachebust=1349356376&amp;preview=7133"><abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fireworks---information-for-suppliers-retailers-and-display-event-organisers">Fireworks - information for suppliers, retailers and display event organisers</h2>

<p>Fireworks are available throughout the year from shops licensed to supply them. They become widely available at certain times of the year, mainly a few days before New Yearâs Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year, and in the weeks leading up to Bonfire Night on 5 November.</p>

<p>If you supply or sell fireworks or if you organise display events you must be aware of your responsibilities.</p>

<h3 id="your-responsibilities-as-a-firework-manufacturer-or-importer">Your responsibilities as a firework manufacturer or importer</h3>

<p>If you manufacture category 1, 2 or 3 fireworks or import category 1, 2 or 3 fireworks which are manufactured outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must ensure they conform to European safety standards before supplying them for sale to the public. To do this, you need to ensure that the fireworks have been tested by a notified body (<abbr title="notified body">NB</abbr>).</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="notified body">NB</abbr> has approved them, the products must carry the <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark and be correctly labelled with details of the manufacturer and importer.</p>

<p>Pyrotechnics that were manufactured or imported before 4 July 2010 and that complied with British Standard BS 7114 can continue to be sold without the <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark until 4 July 2017.</p>

<p>Category 3 fireworks must not exceed 120 decibels.</p>

<p>Category 4 display fireworks that are not intended for supply to consumersÂ must be marked accordingly.</p>

<p>If you import fireworks, you must ensure they comply with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> safety standards, carry the <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark and supply information at the point of entry to ensure that fireworks are legally stored and distributed. This information should be given to HM Revenue &amp; Customs and will then be sent to the relevant authorities responsible for storage licences so they can check on deliveries.</p>

<p>Licensing authorities can ask to see information relating to transactions of fireworks exceeding 50 kilograms of net explosive content.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/10-1106-pyrotechnic-regulations-guidance">Download guidance for manufacturers, importers and distributors on firework safety rules from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) website (PDF, 81KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="your-responsibilities-if-you-are-a-fireworks-retailer">Your responsibilities if you are a fireworks retailer</h3>

<p>If you want to sell fireworks to the public, you need to register your shop or obtain a licence from your local authority. The penalties for not registering or being licensed are a fine of up to Â£5,000, a prison sentence of up to three months, or both.</p>

<p>It is illegal for retailers to sell caps, cracker snaps, novelty matches, party poppers, serpents and throwdowns to anyone who is under 16 and to sell all other fireworks to anyone who is under 18 - it is recommended that proof of age is sought.</p>

<p>You must display a large notice reminding customers about the law with regard to underage sales and possession.</p>

<p>You can only sell fireworks that conform to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> safety standards (or British Standard BS 7114 if they were produced before 4 July 2010) and which carry the <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark and meet certain noise conditions. They must have the <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark or BS 7114 printed on each item or on the retail packaging.</p>

<p>You must also supply fireworks with any safety instructions provided by the manufacturer or importer.</p>

<p>Boxes of fireworks must not be split and sold separately.</p>

<p>Unless you have a special licence, you can only sell fireworks during the weeks leading up to Bonfire Night, New Yearâs Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year.</p>

<h2 id="safety-regulations-for-childrens-products">Safety regulations for childrenâs products</h2>

<p>All toys supplied in the UK must meet the requirements of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995.</p>

<p>The regulations define a toy as âany product or material designed or clearly intended for use in play by children of less than 14 years of age, but excluding those products specified in Schedule 3 [of the regulations]â.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file11286.pdf">download a guide to the Toys (Safety) Regulations from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (PDF, 100K)</a>.</p>

<p>Note that a revised European directive will come into force on 20 July 2011. The directive substantially amends the existing regulations across virtually all safety aspects. You can <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:170:0001:0037:EN:PDF">download the text of the new Directive 2009/48/EC from the EUR-Lex website (PDF, 995K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ce-marking-on-toys">
<abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking on toys</h3>

<p>All toys presented for sale in the UK must bear the <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking and the name and address of the person who first placed the toy on the market.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark is a declaration by the manufacturer that the product satisfies essential safety requirements and can be sold within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Read about <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking in the page in this guide <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ce-marking">products covered by specific safety regulations</a>.</p>

<p>For more information see this guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ce-marking"><abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> marking</a>.</p>

<p>Local authority trading standards officers can remove a toy from the market if they believe it to be unsafe.</p>

<h3 id="testing-for-toys">Testing for toys</h3>

<p>If you manufacture a toy in accordance with the regulations - and the standards cover all aspects relating to the toy - then it can be self-certified.</p>

<p>Where the standards do not cover all aspects relating to the toy, a sample must be submitted for type examination by an approved body.</p>

<p>If you import toys you are responsible for their safety, whether or not they already bear a <abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements">CE</abbr> mark. You might want to consider having them tested to ensure they are safe.</p>

<h3 id="other-child-safety-regulations">Other child safety regulations</h3>

<p>Other laws relating to child safety include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flammability - tough performance requirements regarding flammability are compulsory for childrenâs nightdresses and dressing gowns.</li>
  <li>Choking risks - toys intended for children under 36 months must not present a choking risk. The test uses the âsmall parts cylinderâ - toys or parts of toys that can fit entirely inside the cylinder are identified as choking hazards.</li>
  <li>Magnetic parts - magnets which have a flux of more than 50 kG2mm2 (0,5 T2mm2) and fit entirely in the small parts cylinder are not permitted for use in toys.</li>
  <li>Chemicals - the revised European Directive 2009/48/EC will limit the amounts of certain chemicals that may be contained in materials used for toys. These parts of the directive relating to chemical content will come into force on 20 July 2013. There is also a ban on the use of six phthalates in toys and products for children under three years of age.</li>
  <li>Other products - hood cords, bunk beds and prams and pushchairs are subject to specific safety regulations, namely the Childrenâs Clothing (Hood Cords) Regulations 1976, the Bunk Beds (Entrapment Hazards) (Safety) Regulations 1987 and the Wheeled Child Conveyances (Safety) Regulations 1997.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enquiries">Enquiries</h3>

<p>You should contact your local Trading Standards office, which is responsible for enforcing safety legislation within your area. <a rel="external" href="http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/advice/index.cfm">Find contact details for your local office on the Trading Standards website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="safety-concerns-in-the-early-stages-of-design">Safety concerns in the early stages of design</h2>

<p>Taking into account the safety aspects of your products from the outset of design can help limit your liabilities as you may find it easier to comply with current and future legislation if your products are easier to produce, use,Â maintain and dispose of.</p>

<p>Focusing on the research and design of your products during the early stages of development may also boost your competitiveness through a number of ways such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>efficient use of raw materials and resources</li>
  <li>improved product quality</li>
  <li>reducing or removing hazardous materials from your processes</li>
  <li>better preparation for the end of your productâs lifecycle</li>
  <li>increased market share and better customer relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>While you are creating your product, check that no harm will be caused to makers and consumers by any of the materials or finishing techniques used.</p>

<p>Once a sample of your product is ready for use, check that:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is strong enough to support any loads involved</li>
  <li>it canât produce any toxic, harmful, or adverse effects on the user or consumer</li>
  <li>the materials used are suitable for the purpose and safe for users</li>
  <li>all hazards have been sufficiently controlled, eg electrical insulation, moving parts, folding components, noise and poor ergonomic design</li>
</ul>
<p>When you dispose of a product, check that the parts and materials can be dismantled without causing harm or releasing toxic or harmful substances. Ensure that the recycling of any parts or materials will not release toxic or harmful substances.</p>

<p>Increasingly there is pressure from stakeholders such as the government, regulators, the supply chain and customers to design products that donât have a negative impact on the environment or society.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-concerns">Packaging concerns</h2>

<p>Packaging includes all products used to contain, protect, handle, deliver or present goods. It includes returnable and non-returnable items such as boxes, pallets, labels, containers, tubes, bags, sacks, timber, glass, metals, plastics and ceramics. It can also include tape, wrapping, binding and tying materials.</p>

<p>You should check that your packaging is designed with safety in mind. The packaging should protect your product in transit and protect your customer from potential injury.</p>

<p>By opting to use a safety-led choice of packaging, your business will benefit from meeting legal demands, saving money and promoting an efficient image to suppliers and customers.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation (<abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation">CLP</abbr>) and theÂ GBâsÂ Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009 (<abbr title="GB'sÂ Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr>) govern the labelling and packaging of hazardous/dangerous chemicals. Suppliers must:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify the hazards of the chemical</li>
  <li>give information to their customers about the hazards/dangers, usually on the package itself (such as a label) and provide a safety data sheet (SDS) if the chemicals are to be used at work (provision of an SDS comes under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals Regulation - REACH)</li>
  <li>package the chemical safely</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation">CLP</abbr> has applied to the labels and packaging of hazardous substances since 1 December 2010. It will apply to the labels and packaging of mixtures (called preparations under <abbr title="GB'sÂ Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr>) from 1 June 2015 - however, <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation">CLP</abbr> labels and packaging can be used for mixtures prior to that date.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="GB'sÂ Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr> Regulations were amended to bring them into line with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation">CLP</abbr> and REACH regulations. The eventual aim is to have a globally harmonised system for the classification and labelling of hazardous chemicals. Once the <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation">CLP</abbr> requirements for mixtures apply, it is anticipated that the <abbr title="GB'sÂ Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr> regulations will be repealed. For more information see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/chemicals">chemicals</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/clp/labelling_sds_en.asp">Read about safety issues for chemicals packaging under <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation">CLP</abbr> on the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/chip/index.htm">Read about safety issues for chemicals packaging under <abbr title="GB'sÂ Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr> on the <abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You must take further action if you want to transport dangerous goods. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-goods-by-road">moving goods by road</a>.</p>

<p>Food packaging and labelling is strictly controlled to protect consumers and provide traceability. See the guide on packaging foods.</p>

<p>You must keep your use of packaging to a minimum, avoid the use of heavy metals and enable packaging to be recovered. If your business handles more than 50 tonnes of packaging in a year and has a turnover of more than Â£2 million, you must recover and recycle set amounts of packaging.</p>

<h2 id="product-liability-and-taking-out-insurance">Product liability and taking out insurance</h2>

<p>Itâs a criminal offence for manufacturers to supply unsafe products. They may also be liable under civil law for any harm such products cause - which could result in costly legal proceedings.</p>

<p>TheÂ Consumer Protection Act 1987 makes manufacturers strictly liable for death, injury, loss or damage caused by defective (unsafe) products.</p>

<p>If a finished product contains a defect in a particular component, both the product manufacturer and component manufacturer may be liable.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file22866.pdf">download the guide to the product liability and safety provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (PDF, 207K)</a>.</p>

<p>Other suppliers, such as wholesalers and retailers, are not liable unless they fail to identify the producer when asked to do so by a person who has suffered harm.</p>

<p>But customers can sue retailers under laws on the sale of goods.</p>

<p>You should take positive action to monitor the safety of your products. You should also make sure you are covered by product liability insurance if you manufacture or repair products, and possibly if you sell them, too.</p>

<p>Insurance will provide valuable protection for your business against any costs or compensation awarded. Although itâs not a legal requirement to have this type of insurance, it could mean the survival of your business should a claim be made against you.Â </p>
