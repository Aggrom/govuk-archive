<h2>Types of <abbr title="Public service vehicle">PSV</abbr> licence</h2>

<p>There are 4 types of <abbr title="Public service vehicle">PSV</abbr> operator licences, plus special licensing rules in London.</p>

<h3>Standard licence - national operations only</h3>

<p>If you apply for a standard licence you can only operate within Great Britain. Most full-time commercial operators use standard licences.</p>

<h3>Standard licence - national and international operations</h3>

<p>This kind of licence lets you take passengers abroad as well as within Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Restricted licence</h3>

<p>You can only apply for a restricted licence for small-scale operations. They allow you to use 1 or 2 vehicles, and neither can carry more than 8 passengers.</p>

<p>You can carry up to 16 passengers in either vehicle if you don’t use it as part of a passenger transport business, or you’re operating your vehicles as a sideline and not as your main job.</p>

<h3>Special restricted licence</h3>

<p>Special restricted licences are used to operate a licensed taxi on a local service. You can only apply for this licence if you’re a licensed taxi operator. A local service is one where:  </p>

<ul>
<li>stops are no more than 24.15 kilometres (15 miles) apart</li>
  <li>at least one stop is within the area of the district council that issued your taxi or private hire vehicle (PHV) licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The service must be registered with the local <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/tpm/traffic-commissioners" title="Traffic Commissioner">Traffic Commissioner.</a></p>

<h3>Licensing in London</h3>

<p>You’ll need a London Service Permit to <a rel="external" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/businessandpartners/busoperators/1228.aspx" title="run a private bus or coach service in London">run a private bus or coach service in London.</a></p>
