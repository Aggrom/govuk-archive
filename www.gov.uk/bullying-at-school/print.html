  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="the-law"><header><h1>Part 1: The law</h1>
  </header><p>Some forms of bullying are illegal and should be <a rel="external" href="http://www.police.uk" title="Official police website - find your local police station">reported to the police.</a> These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>violence or assault</li>
  <li>theft</li>
  <li>repeated harassment or intimidation, eg name calling, threats and abusive phone calls, emails or text messages </li>
  <li>hate crimes</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Call 999 if you or someone else is in immediate danger.</p>

<h2>Schools and the law</h2>
<p>By law, all state (not private) schools must have a behaviour policy in place that includes measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.</p>

<p>This policy is decided by the school. All teachers, pupils and parents must be told what it is.</p>

<h3>Anti-discrimination law</h3>
<p>Schools must also follow <a href="/discrimination-your-rights" title="Discrimination: your rights">anti-discrimination law</a>. This means staff must act to prevent discrimination, harassment and victimisation within the school. This applies to all schools in England and Wales, and most schools in Scotland. </p>

<p>Northern Ireland has <a rel="external" href="http://www.equalityni.org/sections/default.asp?secid=2" title="Equality Commission for Northern Ireland website - your rights">different anti-discrimination law.</a> </p>

</article><article id="reporting-bullying"><header><h1>Part 2: Reporting bullying</h1>
  </header><p>You should report bullying to your school in the first place - or someone you trust if it happens outside school, eg in a club or online.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.police.uk" title="Official police website - find your local police station">Tell the police</a> if the bullying involves a crime.</p>

<h2>Schools - reporting bullying</h2>
<p>School staff will deal with bullying in different ways, depending on how serious the bullying is. </p>

<p>They might deal with it in school, eg by disciplining bullies, or they might report it to the police or social services.</p>

<p>Any discipline must take account of special educational needs or disabilities that the pupils involved may have.</p>

<h2>Police - reporting bullying</h2>
<p>Anyone can <a rel="external" href="http://www.police.uk" title="Official police website - find your local police station">make a complaint to the police</a> about bullying but it’s usually a good idea to speak to your school first. </p>

<p>If you’re reporting cyberbullying, keep a record of the date and time of the calls, emails or texts - don’t delete any messages you receive. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Call 999 if you or someone else is in immediate danger.</p>

</ul></article><article id="bullying-outside-school"><header><h1>Part 3: Bullying outside school</h1>
  </header><p>Head teachers have the legal power to make sure pupils behave outside of school premises (state schools only). </p>

<p>This includes bullying that happens anywhere off the school premises, eg on public transport or in a town centre. </p>

<p>School staff can also choose to report bullying to the police or local council. </p>

</article><article id="bullying-a-definition"><header><h1>Part 4: Bullying - a definition</h1>
  </header><p>There is no legal definition of bullying.</p>

<p>However, it’s usually defined as behaviour that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>repeated</li>
  <li>intended to hurt someone either physically or emotionally</li>
  <li>often aimed at certain groups, eg because of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes many forms and can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>physical assault</li>
  <li>teasing</li>
  <li>making threats</li>
  <li>name calling</li>
  <li>cyberbullying - bullying via mobile phone or online (eg email, social networks and instant messenger)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your school should have its own definition of bullying. </p>
