    <section role="main"><header><h1>Redundancy: your rights, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Redundancy is a form of dismissal from your job.</p>

<p>If you’re being made redundant you have a right:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>not to be chosen unfairly  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to a notice period and pay</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer should consult you before making you redundant. </p>

<p>You may also be entitled to <a href="/calculate-redundancy-pay" title="Statutory redundancy pay">statutory redundancy pay</a> if you’ve worked for your employer for at least 2 years. </p>

</article><article id="20-or-more-redundancies"><header><h1>Part 2: 20 or more redundancies</h1>
  </header><p>If your employer is making fewer than 20 employees redundant in one establishment they should:</p>

<ul>
<li>speak to you directly about why you’ve been selected   </li>
  <li>look at any alternatives to redundancy</li>
</ul>
<p>If this doesn’t happen, your <a href="/dismissal" title="Dismissals">dismissal</a> for redundancy may be unfair.</p>

<h2>Collective consultation</h2>
<p>Your employer must consult your representatives (reps) if they are making 20 or more employees redundant in one establishment within a 90 day period. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Only employees are included when counting the number of redundancies, not ‘workers - check your <a href="/employment-status" title="Employment status">employment status</a>’</p>
</div>

<p>If your employer doesn’t consult your reps, you may be able to make an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment Tribunals">Employment Tribunal</a> claim for a protective award. This is an award of up to 90 days’ pay.</p>

<h2>Consulting trade union reps</h2>
<p>If you’re represented by a recognised trade union in your workplace your employer should consult with your trade union reps. They don’t have to consult collectively with anybody else, but are free to do so.</p>

<h2>Consulting with employee reps</h2>
<p>Your employer should allow you to elect reps to take part in the consultation for you if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your employer doesn’t recognise a trade union </li>
  <li>you work in a part of the company that isn’t represented by a recognised trade union</li>
</ul>
<h2>Electing employee reps</h2>

<p>If you’re an employee affected by the proposed redundancies you:</p>

<ul>
<li>can stand for election as an employee rep but must be fit for the task</li>
  <li>are entitled to vote in the election for reps and can vote for as many candidates as there will be reps</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p>For example: it wouldn’t be appropriate for a committee set up to discuss the work of a staff canteen to be consulted about redundancies amongst sales staff</p>
</div>

<p>Your employer must make sure that the elections are fair.    </p>

<h2>Consulting with you directly</h2>
<p>Your employer can consult with you directly:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you aren’t represented by a recognised trade union </li>
  <li>you don’t elect reps  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Rights of employees and reps</h2>

<p>Employees and employee reps have certain rights similar to trade union reps. </p>

<p>For more information download the <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=2391%22ACAS%20Code%20of%20Practice%20Time%20off%20for%20trade%20union%20duties%20and%20activities%22" rel="external">ACAS Code of Practice - Time off for trade union duties and activities (930KB).</a> </p>

<p>If you take part in an election to become a rep or carry out duties as a rep your employer can’t dismiss you or ‘subject you to a detriment’.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>For example: give other employees a pay rise but not you</p>
</div>

<p>If they do you may be able to make a claim to an Employment Tribunal.</p>

</article><article id="how-does-collective-consultation-work"><header><h1>Part 3: How does collective consultation work</h1>
  </header><p>Collective consultation must cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>ways to avoid redundancies  </li>
  <li>the reasons for redundancies  </li>
  <li>how to keep the number of dismissals to a minimum  </li>
  <li>how to limit the effects of those dismissed, for example by offering retraining</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be special circumstances where it’s not reasonably practical for your employer to consult fully. They must then do everything they can to make sure that the consultation is as full as possible.</p>

<h2>Information during consultation</h2>

<p>For reps to make constructive proposals your employer must provide them with enough written information in good time including:</p>

<ul>
<li>reasons for the proposed redundancies   </li>
  <li>number of employees that are proposed to be made redundant   </li>
  <li>different types of employees that are proposed to be made redundant   </li>
  <li>number and types of employees   </li>
  <li>how any employees to be made redundant will be selected   </li>
  <li>time period over which any redundancies may be carried out    </li>
  <li>how any redundancy payments will be calculated  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Consultation period</h2>
<p>A consultation:</p>

<ul>
<li>must begin in good time  </li>
  <li>take as long as is necessary  </li>
  <li>can’t end before agreement is reached  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer should give your reps a fair opportunity to comment on the proposals and suggest alternatives, which you employer must consider. Your employer has the final decision.</p>

<p>There is no time limit to how long a consultation period may last but there is a minimum period between the start of the consultation and actual dismissals. </p>

<p>The length of the minimum period depends on the number of redundancies that your employer is proposing, if they are proposing:</p>

<ul>
<li>20 to 99 redundancies, they must start the consultation at least 30 days before any dismissals take effect   </li>
  <li>100 or more redundancies, the consultation must start at least 90 days before any dismissals take effect  </li>
</ul>
<h2>If your employer doesn’t consult</h2>
<p>You or your rep might be able to make a claim to an Employment Tribunal for a ‘protective award’ if your employer:</p>

<ul>
<li>doesn’t begin consultation early enough   </li>
  <li>ends the consultation early    </li>
  <li>doesn’t consult properly </li>
</ul>
<p>An Employment Tribunal could make a ‘protective award’ of up to 90 days’ pay. The amount will be decided based on the extent of your employer’s failure to consult and the circumstances.</p>

<h2>Termination notices</h2>

<p>A termination notice tells you when the last day of your employment will be.</p>

<p>You can’t be given a termination notice until the consultation has been completed, even if the consultation needs to go beyond the minimum period.</p>

<p>You can agree to leave early, for example by taking <a href="notice-periods-and-pay" title="Notice periods and pay">pay in lieu of notice.</a></p>

<h2>Your employer must tell the government</h2>

<p>Your employer must notify the government via the Redundancy Payments Service:</p>

<ul>
<li>if within a 90 day period, 20 or more redundancies are proposed  </li>
  <li>before any termination notices are sent to employees  </li>
  <li>at least 30 days before any dismissal takes effect  </li>
</ul>
<p>If 100 or more redundancies are proposed, this notification must be at least 90 days before any dismissal takes effect.</p>

<p>Your employer must give a copy of the notification to your reps. If your employer doesn’t notify the government correctly then they can be fined.</p>

</article><article id="your-right-not-to-be-chosen-unfairly"><header><h1>Part 4: Your right not to be chosen unfairly</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer should use a fair and objective way of selecting you for redundancy.</p>

<p>Normally your job must have disappeared for your employer to make you redundant. </p>

<p>Sometimes an employer may use a combination of criteria, perhaps using some kind of points system to get an overall score.</p>

<p>It’s up to your employer which method they use to select you for redundancy, as long as they can show that they are fair. The most commonly used methods are:</p>

<ul>
<li>last in, first out (where the employees with the shortest length of service are selected first)   </li>
  <li>asking for volunteers (self-selection)  </li>
  <li>disciplinary records   </li>
  <li>staff appraisal markings, skills, qualifications and experience  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Reapplying for you own job</h2>

<p>Your employer may select you by asking you to reapply for your own job. You should remember that this is still just a way for the employer to decide who to select for redundancy. </p>

<p>If you decide not to apply or are unsuccessful in your application, you still have a job until your employer makes you redundant.</p>

<h2>Reasons for which you cannot be selected</h2>
<p>Your redundancy will be automatically unfair if you’re chosen for redundancy for discriminatory or personal reasons.</p>

<p>Your employer can’t select groups of people for redundancy based on the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
<li>gender</li>
  <li>marital status  </li>
  <li>sexual orientation  </li>
  <li>race  </li>
  <li>disability  </li>
  <li>religion or belief  </li>
  <li>age  </li>
  <li>trade union membership  </li>
  <li>health and safety activities  </li>
  <li>working pattern (eg part-time or fixed-term employees)  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer must not use personal reasons for selecting you for redundancy including:</p>

<ul>
<li>maternity leave, birth or pregnancy  </li>
  <li>paternity leave, parental or dependants leave   </li>
  <li>you’re disabled   </li>
  <li>your membership or non-membership of a trade union   </li>
  <li>you’re exercising your statutory rights  </li>
  <li>whistleblowing (that is, making disclosures about your employer’s wrongdoing)  </li>
  <li>taking part in lawful industrial action lasting 12 weeks or less   </li>
  <li>taking action on health and safety grounds   </li>
  <li>doing jury service   </li>
  <li>you’re the trusteeship of a company pension scheme  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Last in first out</h2>
<p>Your employer can look at all employees’ length of service with the company, and select those with the shortest service - the last to join.</p>

<p>This can sometimes be indirect discrimination on the grounds of age if it affects one age group more than another, unless your employer can objectively justify it.</p>

<h2>Appealing the decision</h2>
<p>If you feel that your employer has selected you unfairly you can appeal against the decision. </p>

<p>Put your appeal in writing, explaining what you want the employer to do to put the situation right. </p>

<p>You may be able to make a claim to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment Tribunals">Employment Tribunal</a> for unfair dismissal.</p>

<p>The way in which you were selected will affect whether your redundancy is considered fair by an Employment Tribunal.</p>

<h2>Voluntary redundancy</h2>

<p>If you volunteer for redundancy, it’s up to your employer whether they actually select you.</p>

</article><article id="offering-you-a-suitable-alternative"><header><h1>Part 5: Offering you a suitable alternative</h1>
  </header><p>If your employer is making you redundant they should try to offer you suitable alternative employment within their organisation or an associated company. </p>

<h2>What is a ‘suitable alternative’</h2>
<p>Whether a job is ‘suitable alternative employment’ depends on several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>how close the work is to your current job   </li>
  <li>the terms of the job being offered   </li>
  <li>your skills, abilities and circumstances in relation to the job   </li>
  <li>the pay (including benefits), status, hours and location of the job  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re being made redundant because there is not enough work and work picks up before your redundancy, your employer can offer you your own job back as ‘suitable alternative work’.</p>

<p>Any offer for alternative employment should be made before your old job ends. </p>

<p>You should be given enough information about what the new job involves so you know how different it is from your old job.</p>

<p>During your redundancy period, you should be told about available job vacancies within the company.</p>

<p>If your employer has suitable alternative employment but doesn’t offer it to you, your redundancy could be an automatically unfair dismissal.</p>

<h2>Trial periods</h2>

<p>If your employer offers you alternative employment you’ve the right to a 4 week trial period. </p>

<p>If you need training for the new job, the 4 week period can be extended with written agreement.</p>

<p>If you decide the new job isn’t suitable, tell your employer during the trial period. This will not affect your employment rights, including your right to statutory redundancy pay.</p>

<p>If you haven’t given notice by the end of the trial period your right to statutory redundancy pay ends.</p>

<h2>If you refuse an offer</h2>
<p>If your employer offers you suitable alternative employment and you unreasonably refuse it, you may lose your right to statutory redundancy pay.</p>

<p>Disputes about whether employment is suitable or whether your refusal is unreasonable, can be decided by an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment Tribunals">Employment Tribunal</a>. They can decide whether you’re entitled to redundancy pay.</p>

<h2>Time off for job hunting</h2>
<p>If you’ve been continuously employed for 2 years by the date your notice expires, you’re allowed a reasonable amount of time off during your notice period to:</p>

<ul>
<li>look for another job   </li>
  <li>arrange training to help you find another job  </li>
</ul>
<p>How long you can take will depend on your circumstances. If go for an interview and don’t take excessive amounts of travelling time, then this is likely to be reasonable.</p>

<p>Whatever the amount of time off you take, your employer only has to pay you up to two-fifths of a week’s pay for it. </p>

<div class="example">
<p>Example: if you work 5 days a week and you take 4 days off in total during the whole notice period, your employer only has to pay you for the first 2 days.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="notice-periods-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 6: Notice periods and pay</h1>
  </header><h2>Notice period</h2>

<p>You must be given a notice period before your employment ends. </p>

<p>The statutory redundancy notice periods are:</p>

<ul>
<li>at least 1 week’s notice if you’ve been employed between 1 month and 2 years   </li>
  <li>1 week’s notice for each year if employed between 2 and 12 years   </li>
  <li>12 weeks’ notice if employed for 12 years or more</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notice pay</h2>

<p>As well as statutory redundancy pay, your employer should either:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay you through your notice period  </li>
  <li>pay you in lieu of notice depending on your circumstances  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Payment in lieu of notice</h2>

<p>Payment in lieu of notice (<abbr title="Payment in lieu of notice">PILON</abbr>) is money paid to you by your employer as an alternative to being given your full notice. </p>

<p>In some cases your employer may have included a payment in lieu of notice clause in your employment contract. </p>

<p>This means that your employer can end your employment contract with no notice.</p>

<p>However they must give you all of the basic pay you would have received during the notice period. It may also include pension contributions or private health care insurance.</p>


</article><article id="statutory-redundancy-pay-"><header><h1>Part 7: Statutory redundancy pay </h1>
  </header><p>If you’re entitled to statutory redundancy pay it is based on:  </p>

<ul>
<li>how long you have been continuously employed  </li>
  <li>your age  </li>
  <li>your weekly pay, up to a certain limit (£430 current maximum)  </li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get:</p>

<ul>
<li>half a week’s pay for each full year of service where your age was under 22   </li>
  <li>1 week’s pay for each full year of service where your age was 22 or above, but under 41  </li>
  <li>one and half week’s pay for each full year of service where your age was 41 or above</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/calculate-redundancy-pay" title="Calculate your redundancy pay">Calculate your redundancy pay</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer:</p>

<ul>
<li>should automatically pay it  </li>
  <li>must give you details in writing of how your payment has been calculated</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tax</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Redundancy pay under £30,000 is not taxable</p>
</div>

<p>More information on whether elements of the payment, such as pay in lieu of notice (PILON), is taxable is available from <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/start.jsp" title="HMRC">HM Revenue and Customs.</a></p>

<p>Pay in lieu of notice is money paid to you by your employer as an alternative to being given your full notice.</p>

<h2>What to do if your employer does not pay you</h2>
<p>If you’re entitled to it write to them within 6 months of your termination asking for payment. </p>

<p>If your employer still refuses to pay you or can’t make the payment you could make an appeal to an Employment Tribunal.</p>

<h2>Relevant end date for your years of service</h2>

<p>The number of weeks’ redundancy pay you should receive is worked out up until a set ‘relevant date’. </p>

<p>It is important to know when this date is so you can work out how many full years of continuous service you have.</p>

<p>The ‘relevant date’ can be a number of dates. In most cases it will be the date when your employment ends. For example, the last day of your notice period. </p>

<p>In some situations it will be different:</p>

<ul>
<li>if your employer gave you a statutory notice period until a set date, then changed your notice period to finish earlier - the relevant date will be when your notice should have finished before it changed  </li>
  <li>if you are on a trial period for another position within the company and your employer lets you go because the work is not suitable - the relevant date would be when your original contract ended before the trial period   </li>
  <li>if you do not have a statutory notice period - for example because of a payment in lieu arrangement - the relevant date would be when your employment contract would have ended if you had a statutory notice period  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Short-term and temporary lay-offs</h2>
<p>You can claim statutory redundancy pay from your employer if you have been temporarily laid off for either:</p>

<ul>
<li>more than 4 weeks in a row   </li>
  <li>more than 6 non-consecutive weeks in a 13 week period  </li>
</ul>
<p>Write to your employer telling them you intend to claim statutory redundancy pay. This must be done within 4 weeks of your last non-working day in the 4 or 6 week period.</p>

<p>Within 7 days of getting your letter, your employer could send you a counter-notice if they believe that your normal work is likely to start within 4 weeks and continue for at least 13 weeks.</p>

<p>If your employer does not reject your claim within 7 days of receiving it, then write to your employer again giving them your notice.</p>

<h2>Insolvent employers</h2>
<p>You can apply for a direct payment from the National Insurance Fund if your employer:</p>

<ul>
<li>is declared insolvent  </li>
  <li>can’t pay your statutory redundancy pay  </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To do this you must first write to your employer asking for your statutory redundancy pay</p>
</div>

<p>If they are still unable to pay you then you should fill out a Redundancy Payment Form RP1. Copies are available from the Department for Business publications  - call 0845 015 0010 and quote reference URN10/708.</p>

<h3>Contractual redundancy pay</h3>
<p>Check your employment contract to see if your employer offers a more generous redundancy package. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your employer can’t offer you less than the statutory minimum redundancy pay through your employment contract.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="employees-not-entitled-to-statutory-redundancy-pay"><header><h1>Part 8: Employees not entitled to statutory redundancy pay</h1>
  </header><p>You’re not entitled to statutory redundancy pay if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your employer offers to keep you on    </li>
  <li>your employer offers you suitable alternative work which you refuse without good reason  </li>
  <li>you’re dismissed for misconduct with - no notice, little notice or a statement from your employer saying they would have been entitled to dismiss you without notice</li>
</ul>
<p>However, your employer must still follow fair dismissal procedures.</p>

<p>If you fall into the following categories then you’re not entitled to get statutory redundancy pay:</p>

<ul>
<li>members of the armed forces  </li>
  <li>House of Lords and House of Commons staff  </li>
  <li>some apprentices - although you should check your contract   </li>
  <li>domestic servants working in private homes who are members of the employer’s immediate close family  </li>
  <li>‘share fishermen’ paid only by a share in the proceeds of the catch   </li>
  <li>Crown servants or employees in a public office   </li>
  <li>employees of the government of an overseas territory  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Loosing your right to statutory redundancy pay</h2>

<p>You may lose your right to statutory redundancy pay if you leave the job you’re being made redundant from before your notice period has finished.</p>

<h2>Strike action during your notice period</h2>

<p>If you go on strike during your redundancy period you’re still entitled to your redundancy rights. </p>

<p>However, your employer might ‘serve a notice of extension’ which is a request that you work the days lost during the strike period at the end of your notice.</p>

<p>If you don’t agree to work the lost days, then your employer may be able to refuse to make your statutory redundancy payment.</p>

</article><article id="leaving-your-job-and-where-to-get-help"><header><h1>Part 9: Leaving your job and where to get help</h1>
  </header><h2>On your last day</h2>

<p>You should get:</p>

<ul>
<li>wages you’re entitled to</li>
  <li>payment for any outstanding period of notice that you’ve not worked</li>
  <li>accrued holiday pay (payment for holiday owed which has not been taken)  </li>
  <li>Income Tax form P45  </li>
  <li>redundancy pay  </li>
  <li>a letter stating the date of redundancy  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Claiming benefits after redundancy</h2>
<p>If you make a benefit claim, you may be asked about any redundancy payments.</p>

<p>Your Jobcentre Plus adviser will explain whether these payments will have any effect on your claim.</p>

<p>You may get a payment from your employer when your job ends - final pay, wages if you worked a week in hand, holiday pay. These payments aren’t taken into account when your claim for Jobseeker’s Allowance or Income Support is considered.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can use the <a href="/benefits-calculator" title="benefits calculator">benefits calculator</a> to find out which benefits you’re entitled to</p>
</div>

<h2>How your retirement might be affected</h2>

<p>If you’re worried or have questions about how saving for your retirement might be affected by redundancy contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/" title="Pensions Advisory Service">Pensions Advisory Service.</a></p>

<h2>Starting a new job before your notice has expired</h2>

<p>If your new job starts before your redundancy notice expires, try to negotiate with your employer for early release without losing your redundancy pay. </p>

<p>If your employer doesn’t agree to let you go early you should give them ‘a written counter notice’ stating when you would like to finish. </p>

<p>Your employer should write back to you and say whether or not you can leave early.</p>

<p>If you leave early without your employer’s permission you run the risk of losing some or all of your redundancy pay. </p>

<h2>Where to get help</h2>

<p>Talk to your employer first. If you have an employee rep (eg a trade union rep), they may be able to help.</p>

<p>You may need to make a complaint using your employer’s internal <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="Solve a workplace dispute">grievance procedure.</a></p>
