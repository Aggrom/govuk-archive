  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t need a licence to drive a mobility scooter or powered wheelchair, but you may have to register it and get a ‘nil value’ tax disc. Only certain types can be <a href="/mobility-scooters-and-powered-wheelchairs-the-rules/driving-on-the-road" title="Driving on the road">driven on the road</a>.</p>

<p>Mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs come in 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘class 2 invalid carriages’ - these can’t be used on the road (except where there isn’t a pavement) and have a maximum speed of 4mph</li>
  <li>‘class 3 invalid carriages’ - these can be used on the road, and have a maximum speed of 4mph off the road, and 8mph on the road </li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to register a class 2 invalid carriage and they don’t need a tax disc.</p>

<p>Class 3 invalid carriages need to display a ‘nil value’ tax disc and be registered with <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>. You must be 14 or over to drive a class 3 invalid carriage.</p>


</article><article id="rules-for-class-3-invalid-carriages"><header><h1>Part 2: Rules for class 3 invalid carriages</h1>
  </header><p>Because class 3 invalid carriages can be used on the road they need to meet certain extra rules. Otherwise you could be stopped by the police. Class 3 invalid carriages need the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>a maximum unladen weight of 150 kilograms</li>
  <li>a maximum width of 0.85 metres</li>
  <li>a device to limit its speed to 4mph</li>

  <li>a rear view mirror</li>
  <li>an amber flashing light if it’s used on a dual carriageway</li>
</ul></article><article id="driving-on-the-road"><header><h1>Part 3: Driving on the road</h1>
  </header><p>You can only drive on the road in a class 3 invalid carriage. The maximum speed is 8mph.</p>

<p>You can’t drive on bus lanes, ‘cycle only’ cycle lanes and motorways. You should avoid using dual carriageways with a speed limit of over 50mph.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you do use it on a dual carriageway, you must use an amber flashing light for visibility.</p>
</div>

<h2>Road rules</h2>

<p>If you’re on the road in your mobility scooter you have to follow the rules of the <a href="/highway-code" title="Highway Code">Highway Code</a>.</p>

</article><article id="driving-on-footpaths-and-parking"><header><h1>Part 4: Driving on footpaths and parking</h1>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">

</div>

<h2>Parking</h2>

<p>All normal parking restrictions apply to mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs.</p>

<p>Your vehicle should not be left on a footpath or pedestrian area on its own if it gets in the way of other pedestrians, including wheelchair users and people with prams or pushchairs.</p>

</article><article id="eyesight-requirements"><header><h1>Part 5: Eyesight requirements</h1>
  </header><p>There is no legal eyesight requirement to drive mobility scooters or powered wheelchairs, but you should be able to read a car’s registration number from a distance of 12.3 metres (40 feet).</p>

<p>You must check that you can still do this regularly.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you have an accident and poor eyesight was part of the cause, you might have to pay compensation.</p>
