  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="apply-for-a-home"><header><h1>Part 1: Apply for a home</h1>
  </header><p>Housing associations offer similar types of housing as local councils – often to people on a low income or who need extra support.</p>

<p>You can apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>directly to a housing association</li>
  <li>often through your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Contact your local council">local council</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply to more than one housing association at a time.</p>

<h2>Waiting list</h2>
<p>Once you apply, you’ll be put on a waiting list.</p>

<p>Housing associations normally offer housing to people most suited to that particular property. You may have to wait a long time for a suitable property to become available.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Housing associations are also known as Registered Social Landlords or Private Registered Providers of Social Housing.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="types-of-tenancy"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of tenancy</h1>
  </header><p>Your rights and responsibilities depend on the type of tenancy you have.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your tenancy agreement is a legal document that tells you all the rules about living in your property.</p>
</div>

<h2>Starter tenancy</h2>
<p>New housing association tenants may be offered a starter tenancy. These usually last 12 months and are like a ‘trial’ period.</p>

<p>You become an assured or fixed term tenant after 12 months, unless your housing association has either:</p>

<ul>
<li>started action to evict you </li>
  <li>extended your starter tenancy </li>
</ul>
<h2>Assured and fixed-term tenancies</h2>

<p>At the end of your starter tenancy you’ll be offered either: </p>

<ul>
<li>an assured tenancy - meaning you can normally live in your property for the rest of your life</li>
  <li>a fixed-term tenancy - usually lasting for at least 5 years (your landlord will decide whether it’s renewed)</li>
</ul>
<p>You rights may include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/right-to-acquire-buying-housing-association-home" title="Housing association homes: Right to Acquire">buying your home</a></li>
  <li>having your home repaired </li>
  <li>swapping your home with another council or housing association tenant</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ending your tenancy</h2>
<p>Your tenancy can be ended if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you give the housing association 4 weeks’ notice in writing </li>
  <li>the housing association <a href="/council-housing-association-evictions" title="Council and housing association evictions">evicts</a> you</li>
  <li>you transfer your tenancy to someone else or swap homes </li>
  <li>the housing association needs to move you (eg to redevelop your property) - it should offer you a new property</li>
</ul></article><article id="standard-of-your-home"><header><h1>Part 3: Standard of your home</h1>
  </header><p>Your landlord has to make sure that your home meets certain standards. It must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>safe and free from ‘category 1 hazards’ - these are things that can cause death or pose a serious danger to your health (eg by causing lung cancer, 80% burn injuries, loss of limbs, poisoning)</li>
  <li>in a reasonable state of repair</li>
  <li>equipped with reasonably modern facilities</li>
  <li>warm enough</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have concerns about the standard of your home:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Try to sort it out by raising it informally with your landlord first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this doesn’t work, make a formal complaint (your landlord will tell you how to do this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re not happy with the way the complaint has been handled, call the Housing Ombudsman - it might be able to investigate for you.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</article><article id="buying-your-home"><header><h1>Part 4: Buying your home</h1>
  </header><p>As a housing association tenant, you might be able to <a href="/right-to-acquire-buying-housing-association-home" title="Right to Acquire: buying your housing association home">buy your housing association home</a> at a discount.</p>
