It means that employers can normally force their employees to move to places allowed by the clause, unless this is completely unreasonable. </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> It would be unreasonable to ask an employee to move to another country with only 1 day&rsquo;s notice.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Employees without a mobility clause in their contract can choose whether or not to move. </p>\n\n<h2>Redundancy</h2>\n\n<p>Employers can make their employees <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\" title=\"Redundancy: your rights\">redundant</a> if they decide not to move. </p>\n\n<p>Employees may have a right to redundancy pay if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>they match the <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\" title=\"Redundancy: your rights\">redundancy criteria</a> - eg they&rsquo;ve worked for the employer for a certain amount of time</li>\n  <li>they&rsquo;re not getting any compensation from their employer because they decided not to move</li>\n  <li>they haven\u2019t \u2018unreasonably\u2019 refused an offer of suitable alternative work </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u2018Unreasonable\u2019 could mean refusing to move even though the new location is nearby and the employee could drive or easily take public transport. </p>\n\n<p>However, it may be reasonable to say no if it involves a difficult journey or affects personal matters like children&rsquo;s education.</p>\n\n<h2>Compensation</h2>\n<p>Employers don&rsquo;t have to offer employees any compensation for relocating, unless it&rsquo;s specified in their contract. </p>\n\n<h2>Disputes</h2>\n\n<p>Employers and employees may have to <a href=\"/solve-workplace-dispute\" title=\"Solve a workplace dispute\">solve a dispute</a> over issues with relocation, eg if they think someone is being unreasonable and refuse them a redundancy payment.</p>\n\n<h2>If an employer is taken over</h2>\n\n<p>If an employer is taken over and the new owners want to relocate, employees&rsquo; rights are protected by certain regulations. These are known as <a href=\"/business-transfers-and-takeovers-your-rights\" title=\"Business transfers and takeovers - your rights\">TUPE - Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment).</a></p>\n\n<p>All employee&rsquo;s existing rights, including contractual rights and redundancy protection, stay the same.
