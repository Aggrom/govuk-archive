</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You must allow an employee time off if they’re called up to serve on a jury.</p>

<p>You’re not allowed to treat them unfavourably for going on jury service, and if you dismiss them they could take you to an employment tribunal.</p>

<p>However, you can ask the employee to try to delay their jury service if their absence would seriously harm your business.</p>

<p>They can only delay jury service once in a 12-month period, and must say on the jury summons when they’ll be available.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Jury service usually lasts up to 10 days, but can be longer.</p>

</article><article id="paying-staff-on-jury-service"><header><h1>Part 2: Paying staff on jury service</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to pay staff while they’re doing jury service, but many employers do.</p>

<h2>If you pay your employee</h2>

<p>If you carry on paying your employee, work out the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and National Insurance contributions in the normal way.</p>

<h2>If you don’t pay your employee</h2>

<p>If you don’t pay your employee, they can claim a loss of earnings allowance from the court.</p>

<p>You’ll have to fill out a Certificate of Loss of Earnings for the court, which your employee will get with their jury service letter.</p>

<p>You don’t need to make any entries on their P11 form or other payroll record.</p>

<h2>If you top up their allowance</h2>

<p>You may decide to top up your employee’s allowance so they don’t lose out on pay.</p>

<p>To do this, subtract the court allowance from their usual take-home pay.</p>

<p>This will give you the top-up payment you’ll need to give the employee.</p>

<p>Deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> and National Insurance contributions from the gross amount of the top-up payment.</p>

<h2>When your employee returns to work</h2>

<p>An employee on a cumulative tax code may have some unused Personal Allowance when they return to work.</p>

<p>As a result, there may be less <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax to pay on their next payday, or they may be entitled to a tax refund.</p>
