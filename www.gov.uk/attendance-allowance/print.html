  </header><p>You could get <a href="/attendance-allowance/what-youll-get" title="Money you'll get">£51.85 or £77.45</a> a week to help with personal care because you’re physically or mentally disabled and you’re aged 65 or over. </p>

<p>This is called Attendance Allowance. It’s paid at 2 different rates and how much you get depends on the level of care that you need because of your disability.</p>

<p>The other <a href="/attendance-allowance/what-youll-get" title="What you'll get">benefits</a> you get can increase if you get Attendance Allowance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re the carer, you could apply for <a href="/carers-allowance" title="Carer's Allowance">Carer’s Allowance</a> to help you look after someone with substantial caring needs.</p>

<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>All benefits, pensions and allowances are paid <a href="/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid" title="how to have your benefits paid">into an account</a>, eg your bank account.</p>

<h2>Changes of circumstances</h2>

<p>It’s your responsibility to tell the helpline if your circumstances change, as this can affect how much you get. For example, you or the person you claim for needs more help, goes into hospital or moves abroad. </p>

<p>Usually your Attendance Allowance won’t be affected if you go: </p>

<ul>
<li>into hospital or a care home for less than 4 weeks </li>
  <li>abroad for less than 26 weeks </li>
  <li>abroad to get medical treatment for a condition which began before you left </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You could get extra Pension Credit, Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit if you get Attendance Allowance - check with the helpline or office dealing with your benefit.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Benefit Enquiry Line</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0800 88 22 00  <br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0800 24 33 55<br>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>Attendance Allowance can be backdated to the date of your claim. This is usually the date your form is received or the date you call the enquiry line (if you return the claim pack within 6 weeks). </p>

<p>It usually takes 40 working days to deal with your claim. It can be quicker if you’re terminally ill. </p>

<p>You might have to have a <a href="/attendance-allowance/eligibility" title="Eligibility">medical assessment</a> to complete your application. </p>

<h3>Special rules - if you’re terminally ill</h3>

<p>If you’re not expected to live more than 6 months, there are ‘special rules’ so you get Attendance Allowance more quickly. You must: </p>

<ul>
<li>complete an Attendance Allowance claim form </li>
  <li>include a DS1500 form - you can only get these from a doctor, specialist or consultant</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do this on behalf of someone else without their permission. The letter about the money awarded won’t mention ‘special rules’. </p>

<h2>Appeal a decision</h2>

<p>You can ask for your Attendance Allowance decision to be reconsidered if you’re unhappy with it, or you can appeal it.</p>
