<h2>When you don’t need to take <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you don’t need to take <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> to ride a moped.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Mopeds have a maximum engine size of 50cc and a maximum speed of approximately 31mph.</p>
</div>

<p>You also don’t have to take <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a full moped licence from passing a full moped test after 1 December 1990</li>
  <li>have a full motorcycle licence for one category and want to upgrade to another</li>
  <li>live and ride on <a href="/cbt-compulsory-basic-training/islands-where-you-dont-need-cbt" title="Islands you don't need CBT for">some offshore islands</a>
</li>
</ul></article><article id="booking-cbt-and-course-fees"><header><h1>Part 2: Booking CBT and course fees</h1>
  </header><p>Compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr>) needs to be booked directly through an approved training body (<abbr title="Approved Training Body">ATB</abbr>).</p>

<p>The cost of <abbr title="Compulsory basic training">CBT</abbr> is set by the <abbr title="Approved Training Body">ATB</abbr> and depends on where the training takes place and if you bring your own moped or motorcycle. </p>

<p><a href="/compulsory-basic-training-cbt-courses" title="Compulsory basic training course (CBT) courses">Contact your nearest <abbr title="Approved Training Body">ATB</abbr></a> for availability and prices.</p>


</article><article id="what-cbt-involves"><header><h1>Part 3: What CBT involves</h1>
  </header><p>Compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>) has 5 elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>introduction and eyesight check</li>
  <li>practical on-site training</li>
  <li>practical on-site riding</li>
  <li>practical on-road training</li>
  <li>practical on-road riding</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll move from one element to the next when your trainer is happy you’ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>learnt the theory</li>
  <li>shown the practical skills to a safe basic level</li>
</ul>
<h2>How many people you’ll train with</h2>

<p>You might train with other learners. There’s a maximum number of:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 learners per trainer for on-site elements</li>
  <li>2 learners per trainer for on-road elements</li>
</ul>

</article><article id="cbt-certificate-of-completion"><header><h1>Part 4: CBT certificate of completion</h1>
  </header><p>When you complete compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>) to at least the minimum standard, you’ll get a certificate of completion – also called a DL196.</p>

<p>Your certificate of completion lets you ride a moped or a motorbike up to 125cc on the road with L plates for 2 years (L or D plates in Wales).</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you haven’t passed your full motorcycle test in 2 years, you’ll need to take <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> again.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you lose your certificate</h2>
<p>The certificate of completion is a legal document. It proves your right to ride as a provisional rider. You may be asked to produce it by the police.</p>

<p>If you lose your certificate, ask the approved training body you the took the course with for a replacement. You can be charged up to £20 for this.</p>


</article><article id="cbt-if-you-have-a-car-driving-licence"><header><h1>Part 5: CBT if you have a car driving licence</h1>
  </header><p>If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you can ride a moped without completing compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you already have a <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> certificate and then pass your car test, you can ride a moped without L plates without taking the full motorcycle test.</p>

<p>In this case the <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> certificate for riding mopeds will last for as long as your car licence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Mopeds have a maximum engine size of 50cc and a maximum speed of approximately 31mph.</p>

</article><article id="complain-about-a-cbt-course"><header><h1>Part 7: Complain about a CBT course</h1>
  </header><p>First, try to sort the issue out with the approved training body (ATB) that organised your course.</p>
