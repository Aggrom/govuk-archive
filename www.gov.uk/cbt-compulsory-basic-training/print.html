<ul>
<li>introduction and eyesight check</li>
  <li>practical on-site training</li>
  <li>practical on-site riding</li>

</article><article id="cbt-certificate-of-completion"><header><h1>Part 4: CBT certificate of completion</h1>
  </header><p>When you complete compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>) to at least the minimum standard, you’ll get a certificate of completion – also called a DL196.</p>

<p>Your certificate of completion lets you ride a moped or a motorbike up to 125cc on the road with L plates for 2 years (L or D plates in Wales).</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you haven’t passed your full motorcycle test in 2 years, you’ll need to take <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> again.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you lose your certificate</h2>
<p>The certificate of completion is a legal document. It proves your right to ride as a provisional rider. You may be asked to produce it by the police.</p>

<p>If you lose your certificate, ask the approved training body you the took the course with for a replacement. You can be charged up to £20 for this.</p>


</article><article id="cbt-if-you-have-a-car-driving-licence"><header><h1>Part 5: CBT if you have a car driving licence</h1>
  </header><p>If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you can ride a moped without completing compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you already have a <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> certificate and then pass your car test, you can ride a moped without L plates without taking the full motorcycle test.</p>

<p>In this case the <abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr> certificate for riding mopeds will last for as long as your car licence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Mopeds have a maximum engine size of 50cc and a maximum speed of approximately 31mph.</p>
