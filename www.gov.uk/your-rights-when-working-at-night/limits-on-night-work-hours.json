This includes:\r\n\r\n- work during the day or night\r\n- regular overtime, but not overtime you work occasionally\r\n\r\nYou can't opt-out of these working time limits. However there are [exceptions to the night work hour limits](exceptions-to-night-work-hour-limits).\r\n\r\n##Calculate your average working time##\r\n\r\nAverage working time is usually calculated over 17 weeks - this is called a reference period.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the average you need to know:\r\n\r\n- what references period applies - any 17-week period unless a collective or workforce agreement sets out otherwise\r\n- that you need to exclude your weekly rest period (if you're a worker over 18, you're entitled to 24 hours without any work each week or 48 hours each fortnight)\r\n\r\nIf you've been in your job for less than 17 weeks, calculate your working time over the period you\u2019ve been working there. \r\n\r\n$E**Example - for a simple working pattern:** You might work alternate 9-hour and 7-hour shifts over 17 weeks, averaging out at 8 hours.$E\r\n\r\n$E**Example - for a shift worker:**\r\nYou're a night worker and work 4, 12-hour shifts each week.\r\n \r\ns1. Multiply the number of weeks in the reference period (17) with the number of hours you work each week: 17 x (4 x 12) = 816 hours worked in the reference period.\r\ns2. In 17 weeks there are 119 days (17 x 7). You're entitled to take 17 weekly rest days, therefore you could be asked to work: 119 - 17 = 102 days you could be asked to work.\r\ns3. Divide your total hours by the number of days you might have to work: 816 \u00f7102 = 8 hours average work in 24 hours.\r\n$E\r\n\r\nBoth are within the working time limit.\r\n\r\n^ If your night work involves special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain, you can **never** work more than 8 hours in any 24-hour period, including daytime overtime. ^\r\n","slug":"limits-on-night-work-hours","title":"Limits on night work hours"}},{"table":{"body":"The normal limits on night work hours don\u2019t apply if you work in:\r\n\r\n* the armed forces, emergency services  \r\n* a private house as a domestic servant\r\n* you do a job where you choose how long you work, eg a managing executive  \r\n\r\nThere are separate rules for workers in [road](http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/freight \"Freight\"){:rel=\"external\"}, \r\n[sea](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-shipsregsandguidance/marinenotices/mcga-mnotice.htm?textobjid=550E6A6B50FC1723 \"Merchant Shipping\"){:rel=\"external\"} or [air transport](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/all?title=civil%20aviation%20working%20time/\"Civil Aviation Working Time\"){:rel=\"external\"}.\r\n\r\nLimits on night work also don't apply if:\r\n\r\n* you're working in an industry with busy peak periods, eg agriculture, retail, tourism or security and surveillance work  \r\n* there\u2019s an emergency or accident\r\n* the job needs round-the-clock staffing - eg hospital work\r\n* you have to travel a long distance from your home to get to work or you constantly work in different places\r\n* you work in the rail industry - on trains or linked to making sure trains run on time  \r\n* a collective or workforce agreement excludes or changes the restriction on night work or the [reference period](limits-on-night-work-hours \"Limits on night work hours\").\r\n\r\n##Rest breaks##\r\n\r\nIn these cases 'compensatory' rest must be given instead.
