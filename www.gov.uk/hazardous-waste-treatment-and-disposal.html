<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are strict controls on the movement, recovery and disposal of hazardous farm waste - waste which is capable of harming human health or the natural environment.</p>

<p>This guide outlines how to identify hazardous waste on your farm using the European Waste Catalogue (<abbr title="European Waste Catalogue">EWC</abbr>). The <abbr title="European Waste Catalogue">EWC</abbr> classifies waste materials according to what they are and how they are produced, and was introduced by the Landfill Directive.</p>

<p>You must use the waste management hierarchy to determine how to prevent, prepare for reuse, recycle or use other recovery methods. You must only dispose of hazardous waste if you have found the first four options inappropriate.</p>

<p>The guide also explains your legal ‘duty of care’ to comply with farm hazardous waste controls, and outlines the role of the Environment Agency (<abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr>) who enforce hazardous waste policy in England.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-identify-and-manage-hazardous-farm-waste">How to identify and manage hazardous farm waste</h2>

<p>Your farm waste will fall into one of three categories as set out by the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>hazardous waste - eg lead batteries or fluorescent light tubes</li>
  <li>potentially hazardous waste that you must assess to find out if it is hazardous or not - eg ink or paint</li>
  <li>non-hazardous waste - eg edible oil</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-identify-hazardous-waste">How to identify hazardous waste</h3>

<p>Hazardous farm waste includes substances such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>oil and oil containers</li>
  <li>some veterinary medicines as well as medical and clinical waste</li>
  <li>pour-on pesticides, insecticides and herbicides concentrate</li>
  <li>sheep dip concentrate</li>
  <li>lead acid batteries</li>
  <li>cleaning chemicals, such as disinfectants and bleach</li>
  <li>asbestos</li>
  <li>antifreeze</li>
  <li>fluorescent light tubes</li>
  <li>agrochemical concentrates</li>
</ul>
<p>Hazardous waste also includes containers that hold residues of hazardous or dangerous substances unless they are emptied, triple rinsed and drained.</p>

<p>Regulations about hazardous waste identify 14 properties that make waste a risk to human health or to the environment. To find out about these hazardous properties, see the table of hazardous wastes.</p>

<p>To find out if the product or substance - including hazardous waste packaging - you are planning to throw away has any of these hazardous properties, see the table of hazardous and non-hazardous farm waste.</p>

<p>Oil leakages and spills are classed as hazardous waste, and you must follow certain rules dealing with storing and managing oil. For further information, see the page on fuel oil in the guide on non-hazardous waste: treatment and disposal.</p>

<p>If you are not sure if your waste type is listed here, you can call the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> Hazardous Waste Registration helpline on 08708 502 858.</p>

<p>If your farm business produces more than 500 kilograms of hazardous waste a year, you will need to register with the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr>. See the page in this guide on registering as a hazardous waste producer.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-manage-hazardous-waste">How to manage hazardous waste</h3>

<p>When dealing with hazardous waste, you must follow health and safety regulations, including Control of Substances Hazardous to Health regulations. For example, unless you have an environmental permit that allows you to do so, you must not mix hazardous waste with another waste or with material that is not waste. For more information, see the regulations that help to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hazardous-waste-treatment-and-disposal">prevent and manage major environmental incidents</a>.</p>

<p>You should provide written instructions for storing and disposing of each type of hazardous waste you produce, and ensure that all your employees and contractors follow these instructions.</p>

<p>You must use the waste management hierarchy to minimise the amount of hazardous waste you produce. You must only dispose of waste if you have determined that you cannot use prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling, or any other recovery method. See the page on choosing a waste management option in the guide on how to save money by reducing, reusing and recycling waste.</p>

<p>When you send hazardous waste away from your site you must declare on your consignment note that you have applied the waste management hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="hazardous-farm-waste-controls">Hazardous farm waste controls</h2>

<p>Hazardous farm waste can cause serious harm to people’s health and to the environment, so there are strict controls on the movement, recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes. This is part of your legal duty of care to dispose of waste correctly.</p>

<p>To comply with hazardous waste controls you must: </p>

<ul>
<li>register with the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> as a business which produces hazardous waste on its premises if you produce more than 500 kilograms of hazardous farm waste in a year - the 500 kilograms limit does not include end of life vehicles - see the page in this guide on registering as a hazardous waste producer</li>
  <li>use consignment notes when you move any hazardous waste, and keep these consignment notes for three years from the date when the waste was moved</li>
  <li>store hazardous waste on your farm in a secure way and for no longer than 12 months - see the page in this guide on storing or removing hazardous waste</li>
  <li>make sure that a registered waste carrier collects your hazardous waste and disposes of it at a suitably permitted site, or take it to a suitably permitted site yourself</li>
  <li>check whether you require an environmental permit or need to register an exemption from environmental permitting for your waste operations - if you recover or dispose of hazardous waste on your farm you will need an environmental permit - you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/115666.aspx">find out what types of waste produced on a farm may be hazardous waste on the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> website</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be breaking the law if you fail to fulfil your duty of care, so you must make sure you dispose of your hazardous waste safely.</p>

<p>Record keeping is an important part of complying with hazardous waste controls and your duty of care. For more information, see the page in this guide on keeping hazardous waste records.</p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance">Cross Compliance</h3>

<p>In order to claim payments under agricultural schemes, farmers must always comply with requirements for cross compliance. These requirements include certain legal conditions when dealing with waste on their land. These conditions are known as cross compliance, and include Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>) and requirements to maintain your land in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>).</p>

<p>You should always bear these conditions in mind when carrying out waste management processes, including dealing with hazardous waste.</p>

<p>For more information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> and <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>, see the guides on this site on cross compliance: the basics, SMRs and standards of GAEC.</p>

<h2 id="register-as-a-hazardous-waste-producer">Register as a hazardous waste producer</h2>

<p>As long as your farm doesn’t produce, hold or remove more than 500 kilograms of hazardous waste in a year you do not have to register your farm as a hazardous waste producer with the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will need to calculate how much hazardous waste you produce. You can ignore the weight of any scrap vehicles, which do not count towards the 500 kilogram limit.</p>

<p>If you do need to register or renew your registration each year, you can do this online or by calling the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> Hazardous Waste Registration Helpline on 08708 502 858. Charges vary depending on the method you use to register.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32198.aspx">read about how to make or renew your hazardous waste producer registration on the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/apps/hazwaste/registrationwelcome.jsp?lang=_e">Find out how to register your farm online for the hazardous waste system on the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Before you register your farm, you will need your Standard Industrial Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr>) code number, and your Companies House number if you are a limited company. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/standard-industrial-classification/index.html">find your <abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr> code on the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>When you register your farm, the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> will give you a unique number called a ‘premises code’. This is valid for 12 months from the date of registration. You will need to renew your premises code before its expiry date if you continue to produce more than 500 kilograms or 500 litres of hazardous waste.</p>

<p>It is an offence for a waste carrier to remove or transport hazardous waste from a farm that is not registered as a hazardous waste producer. If you are exempt, you should provide the carrier with a written statement of this.</p>

<h2 id="storage-or-removal-of-hazardous-waste">Storage or removal of hazardous waste</h2>

<p>You can store hazardous waste on your farm for up to 12 months while you wait for it to be collected for disposal.</p>

<h3 id="storage-of-hazardous-waste">Storage of hazardous waste</h3>

<p>You must store hazardous waste separately from all other waste. You must keep it in designated, sealed, labelled, covered and waterproof containers, and in a separate, secure, waterproof, bunded containment area - this is an area with a secondary barrier around the main containment area.</p>

<p>For information about health and safety issues you should be aware of, see the page on hazardous chemicals in the guide to farm health and safety: the basics.</p>

<p>If you have more than one farm, you can store for up to three months on your main farm:</p>

<ul>
<li>up to 50 cubic metres of non-liquid waste produced at a different farm, or</li>
  <li>up to 1,000 litres of liquid waste produced at a different farm</li>
</ul>
<p>This is covered by a non-Waste Framework Directive exemption, which you do not need to register. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can use this site to find details and apply to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-an-environmental-permit">get an environmental permit.</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="disposal-of-hazardous-waste">Disposal of hazardous waste</h3>

<p>You can dispose of hazardous waste:</p>

<ul>
<li>at an authorised site either by transporting the waste there yourself, or by hiring someone to collect it</li>
  <li>using other authorised recovery methods, such as solvent reclamation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="removal-of-hazardous-waste-from-your-farm">Removal of hazardous waste from your farm</h3>

<p>You can remove hazardous waste from your farm yourself, as long as you take it to a waste-treatment or disposal facility that is licensed to receive hazardous waste.</p>

<p>You do not have to register as a waste carrier if you are transporting your own farm waste, but if you move other farmers’ waste for profit you must register with the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> as a waste carrier.</p>

<h3 id="find-a-licensed-hazardous-waste-disposal-site">Find a licensed hazardous waste disposal site</h3>

<p>The easiest way to find a licensed site to dispose of your hazardous waste is online.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/dataSearchController?lang=_e&amp;textonly=off&amp;topic=wastedirectory">use the Environment Agency waste directory to search for authorised waste recycling and disposal sites</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www2.environment-agency.gov.uk/epr/search.asp">search the hazardous waste Public Registers on the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Before taking waste to the site, you will need to find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>what waste their permit or exemption allows them to accept</li>
  <li>what paperwork you need to take</li>
  <li>what vehicle you can use to carry the waste onto the site</li>
  <li>how to deliver the waste safely</li>
</ul>
<p>At the site, ask the site operator to show you a copy of their permit or exemption certificate. Check that the permit covers the specific type of hazardous waste that you are disposing of.</p>

<h3 id="use-a-waste-management-company-to-remove-your-waste">Use a waste management company to remove your waste</h3>

<p>Before you employ a waste collector, you have a duty of care to check that they:</p>

<ul>
<li>are properly authorised to take your hazardous waste away - eg a registered waste carrier</li>
  <li>dispose of the waste at a properly permitted hazardous waste-treatment or disposal site</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether they handle all the waste types you produce</li>
  <li>where they take the waste</li>
  <li>whether you need to do anything to the waste before they collect it</li>
  <li>what paperwork you need - for example, consignment notes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-find-authorised-waste-collectors">How to find authorised waste collectors</h3>

<p>To find a waste collector local to you, check the Public Registers as above. You can also call the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> Agricultural Waste helpline on 0845 603 3113 and ask them to run a check on your proposed collector.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-keep-hazardous-waste-records">How to keep hazardous waste records</h2>

<p>If you move, receive or dispose of hazardous waste, you need to record every incident of this activity and keep all of your records in a register.</p>

<p>For all the hazardous waste moved on or off your farm, you must keep a record of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the quantity of waste</li>
  <li>the nature of the waste</li>
  <li>where the waste came from</li>
  <li>its destination</li>
  <li>how often you move this type of waste</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pay someone to transport your waste, you must make a record of the waste carrier’s certificate, and the environmental and site permit for the site that receives your waste. You should also note the mode of transport used to remove waste.</p>

<p>If you receive hazardous waste on your farm, you are a ‘consignee’. You need to record where the waste is kept on your site and send this information to the consignor.</p>

<h3 id="receipt-of-hazardous-waste-from-other-farmers">Receipt of hazardous waste from other farmers</h3>

<p>If you receive hazardous waste from other farmers you must record the locations where you have stored or disposed of it on your farm site, within 24 hours of receiving or depositing the waste. This could be in the form of a site plan. You should also provide consignment returns to producers, holders or consignors.</p>

<p>Your records of the locations of hazardous waste must show:</p>

<ul>
<li>where you tipped or stored each waste</li>
  <li>the quantity of each waste received or deposited</li>
  <li>a description of the waste (components, hazardous properties and <abbr title="European Waste Catalogue">EWC</abbr>). For definitions, <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/GEHO0603BIRB-e-e.pdf">download a guidance document on classifying hazardous waste from the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> website (PDF, 545K)</a>
</li>
  <li>the waste’s origin</li>
  <li>the disposal or recovery method</li>
  <li>the consignment note code for each waste deposit</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have a consignment note because you produced the hazardous waste on your own farm, you should produce a consignee quarterly return. This must summarise all the hazardous waste that the consignee has received, deposited or rejected. </p>

<h3 id="how-to-keep-your-hazardous-waste-records">How to keep your hazardous waste records</h3>

<p>You can keep your records on your computer in a format that can be easily copied for anyone who needs to see it. However, some information, eg consignment notes and consignee returns, must be entered on specific forms.</p>

<h3 id="duty-to-provide-information">Duty to provide information</h3>

<p>You must keep all these individual records in a register and make this information available to the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> and emergency services if they require it.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-keep-your-register">Where to keep your register</h3>

<p>If your farm is registered as a hazardous waste producer with the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr>, you must keep your register of hazardous waste records at the registered premises, ie your farm.</p>

<p>If your farm is exempt from registering as a hazardous waste producer, or if you no longer occupy the farm, you must keep your register of hazardous waste records at your principal place of business, unless you have a written agreement with the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> to keep it somewhere else.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-to-keep-the-register">How long to keep the register</h3>

<p>You must keep your register for at least three years from the date when a waste carrier removed the waste from your farm, or when you disposed of the waste on your own site.</p>

<h2 id="consignment-notes-and-consignee-returns">Consignment notes and consignee returns</h2>

<p>You must have a consignment note for every load of hazardous waste that is moved off your farm for disposal or recycling elsewhere and keep a copy for three years.</p>

<h3 id="consignment-notes">Consignment notes</h3>

<p>A consignment note is a special form of transfer note specifically for hazardous waste. It contains information about the waste so that it can be handled safely and disposed of or recovered legally. You should identify the type and amount of each type of hazardous waste, using both words and the appropriate <abbr title="European Waste Catalogue">EWC</abbr> codes. For more information, see the page in this guide on identifying and managing hazardous farm waste.</p>

<p>You can keep consignment notes in paper form or electronically. For more information, see the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32196.aspx">guidance on consignment notes from the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> website (PDF, 684K)</a>.</p>

<p>You can produce your own consignment notes, use the ones produced by your waste contractor or buy standard consignment notes from the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> for a small fee. To order these, call the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> Hazardous Waste Returns Team on 0845 603 1043 (local call rate), or email them at <a href="mailto:hazwasteorders@environment-agency.gov.uk">hazwasteorders@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will not need a consignment note if you are moving:</p>

<ul>
<li>hazardous waste from a location not classed as ‘premises’</li>
  <li>radioactive waste as this is managed by the Radioactive Substances Act 1993</li>
  <li>domestic hazardous waste - this does not include asbestos</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiple-collections">Multiple collections</h3>

<p>If you only have a small amount of hazardous waste, you can ask your collector or carrier to pick it up from your farm when they run a multiple collection round. In this situation, they can fill in most of the consignment form for you.</p>

<h3 id="consignee-returns">Consignee returns</h3>

<p>The person who receives your hazardous waste (the consignee) must send you a ‘consignee’s returns to a producer or holder’. This records that they have received your waste, and what they have done with it.</p>

<p>You must check the consignee’s returns against the consignment notes in your register, to make sure that the consignees have received the total amount of waste you sent from your farm. You should receive the consignee’s returns within four months of sending the waste.</p>

<p>You must send the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> a consignee return on a quarterly basis if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>receive hazardous waste on your site for disposal, recycling or recovery which has been produced elsewhere</li>
  <li>receive hazardous waste, but reject it for any reason</li>
  <li>dispose of your own hazardous waste on your own farm premises</li>
</ul>
<p>You must keep consignee returns for three years after the date of removing the hazardous waste from your farm.</p>

<h2 id="ea-enforcement">
<abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> enforcement</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> is a public body that works towards improving and protecting the environment, and promoting sustainable development.
