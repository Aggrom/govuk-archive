  </header><p>Mortgage Interest Run On is extra money you can get towards your housing costs if certain other benefits are stopping because you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>returning to work full-time</li>
  <li>working more hours</li>
  <li>earning more money</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get this help for 4 weeks. </p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re eligible and were getting <a href="/support-for-mortgage-interest" title="Support for Mortgage Interest">Support for Mortgage Interest</a> before your work situation changed, you’ll usually continue to get the same amount as you were getting before your benefits stopped.</p>

<p>Payments for your mortgage or loan interest will be paid direct to you instead of to your lender.</p>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You can claim Mortgage Interest Run On if you’ve stopped getting income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support or income-related Employment &amp; Support Allowance because you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>returning to work full-time</li>
  <li>working more hours</li>
  <li>earning more money</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the following must also apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve been claiming the benefit continuously for at least 26 weeks </li>
  <li>you expect the work (or more money) to last for 5 weeks or more</li>
  <li>you were entitled to help with your housing costs before your work started and you’ll still have these costs when you start work</li>
</ul></article><article id="how-to-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: How to claim</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t need to apply - you should get Mortgage Interest Run On automatically. You just need to let your <a rel="external" href="http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=1&amp;lang=en" title="contact Jobcentre Plus">Jobcentre Plus</a> office know as soon as you’re starting work.</p>
