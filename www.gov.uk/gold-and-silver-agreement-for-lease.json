However, if you find gold through panning it is unlikely that The Crown Estate will grant you permission to take it away.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Estate may sometimes grant you a lease of Mines Royal within a specific area. However, you will still have to get rights of access to this land from the landowner.\r\n\r\nIf you want to commercially exploit any Mines Royal, you should contact Wardell Armstrong LLP - The Crown Estate Mineral Agent.","updated_at":"2012-10-08T09:43:36+00:00"}],["tags",[{"title":"Licences and licence applications","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business%2Flicences.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Applying for licences from your council for events and businesses","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Flicences","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/licences"},"parent":{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[]]],"parts":null}
