They are listed alphabetically and include currently available medals for the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts through to medals associated with the Crimean War.</p>

<p>The 1939 to 1945 Star was awarded for any period of operational service overseas between 3 September 1939 and 8 May 1945 (2 September 1945 in the Far East).</p>

<p>The criteria is 180 days’ service between these dates, although some special criteria apply when, at certain specified times, just 1 days’ service is required.</p>

<p>Naval personnel qualify after 180 days afloat in areas of operations as laid out in the regulations between certain specified dates.</p>

<p><abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> air crew will qualify with 60 days service in an operational unit including at least one operational sortie.</p>

<p>Air crew of fighter aircraft engaged in the Battle of Britain between 10 July and 31 October 1940 were awarded the Clasp ‘Battle of Britain’ to be worn on the ribbon of the 1939 to 1945 Star.</p>

<h3 id="criteria-1">Criteria</h3>

Northern Ireland, Air Ops Iraq), an Operational Service Medal (<abbr title="Operational Service Medal">OSM</abbr>) (eg. Sierra Leone or Afghanistan) or the Iraq Medal has been issued. An additional 1,080 days is required for the award of the Clasp to the <abbr title="Accumulated Campaign Service Medal">ACSM</abbr>. More than 1 Clasp may be earned.</p>

<h3 id="campaign-history">Campaign History</h3>

<p>In North Africa, British forces fought against the Germans and Italians between 10 June 1940 and 12 May 1943.</p>

<p>Italy entered the war in July 1940 when their forces invaded British colonies in East Africa. When the British fought back Germany sent troops to help the Italians. The British were then weakened after sending forces to aid Greece and German forces advanced, taking control of large areas of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.</p>

<p>The desert conflict continued with the balance of power shifting between the 2 sides until the British eventually secured victory on 12 May 1943 when the remaining German forces surrendered at Tunis.</p>

<p>Some historians consider the British victory over the German forces here to have been the turning point in the war which led to victory.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>Instituted in 1918, the Air Force Cross (<abbr title="Air Force Cross">AFC</abbr>) was issued for acts of gallantry while flying on non-active operations to warrant officers and officers of the Royal Air Force (<abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>). It was later made available to equivalent ranks in the Royal Navy (<abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr>) and Army for acts of gallantry in the air.</p>

<p>The equivalent award for the other ranks for acts of gallantry in the air on non-active operations was the Air Force Medal (<abbr title="Air Force Medal">AFM</abbr>), instituted at the same time as the <abbr title="Air Force Cross">AFC</abbr> and which was also later made available to other ranks of the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> and Army.</p>

<p>Following the 1993 review, the <abbr title="Air Force Medal">AFM</abbr> was discontinued and the <abbr title="Air Force Cross">AFC</abbr> became available to all ranks of all services for exemplary gallantry in the air not in presence of the enemy.

<p><abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> air crew engaged in operations against the enemy will also qualify provided that at least one operational sortie has been completed.</p>

<h3 id="campaign-history-3">Campaign History</h3>

<p>The campaign in Burma took place between 11 December 1941 and 2 September 1945, during which time the Japanese invaded Burma, driving British forces to the Indian border. As the Japanese held superiority in the Pacific it wasn’t until early in 1944 that the Allies were in a position to strike back and regain a foothold in Burma with the aim of finally defeating the Japanese in the Pacific and Far East.</p>

<p>Total surrender of the Japanese came on 2 September 1945 following the dropping of the atom bombs by the Allies on 2 Japanese cities.</p>

<p>PoWs were forced to labour on construction projects such as railway building (as depicted in the film ‘The Bridge on the River Kwai’) and were frequently tortured and starved. Around 13,000 British soldiers and 2,000 civilians died in Japanese wartime camps.</p>

<p>Both were initially issued for 21 years service with exemplary conduct. Over the years the design of the medals and the qualifying criteria have altered, with 15 years now being the length of time required for consideration.
Other medals have also been introduced over time to recognise varying aspects of long, efficient and accumulated service.</p>

<p>These medals, recognising particularly meritorious service, accumulated service on various campaigns, as well as long and efficient service in the Reserve Forces and the Cadet Forces are all still awarded today in one form or another.</p>

<h3 id="history-4">History</h3>
<p>The Distinguished Service Order was instituted originally to reward junior officers in the Army for distinguished service or acts of gallantry against the enemy. While the Order of the Bath had been available for senior officers and the Distinguished Conduct Medal for the other ranks, no award below the level of the Victoria Cross (<abbr title="Victoria Cross">VC</abbr>) had existed for junior officers. The <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">DSO</abbr> was also made available to junior officers of the other services.</p>

<p>After the 1993 review, the <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">DSO</abbr> ceased to be awarded for gallantry - replaced by the new all service, all ranks Conspicuous Gallantry Cross at the level below the <abbr title="Victoria Cross">VC</abbr>. Although theoretically available to all ranks, the <abbr title="Distinguished Service Order">DSO</abbr>, now awarded for distinguished leadership during active operations against the enemy, is likely to be awarded only to the more senior officer ranks.</p>

<h2 id="the-elizabeth-cross---died-on-operations-recognition-award">The Elizabeth Cross - Died on Operations Recognition Award</h2>

<p>This award was created to provide national recognition for the families of Armed Forces personnel who have died on operations or as a result of an act of terrorism.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>The Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll are granted to the next of kin of UK Armed Forces personnel who have died on operations or as a result of an act of terrorism in national recognition of their loss and sacrifice. The Elizabeth Cross is not a posthumous medal for the fallen but an emblem demonstrating tangible national recognition for service families for their loss.</p>

<p>Not all deaths of service personnel are included in this scheme. The death of any service person, whatever the circumstances, is a tragic loss to his or her family and to the Armed Forces as a whole, but the Elizabeth Cross was instituted specifically to recognise the unique challenges that service personnel face on operations and from terrorism, and the particular burden this places on service families.</p>

<p>The first Elizabeth Crosses and Memorial Scrolls were granted from 1 August 2009 (and retrospectively to the end of the World War 2). All eligible next of kin of those who died between 1 January 1948 to date (see below - ‘Eligibility’) are strongly advised to apply, although the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Medal Office will endeavour to establish contact with the more recent eligible families, where up to date contact details are held. See below - ‘Recipients and How to Apply’.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The Elizabeth Cross is made of hallmarked silver and is in the form of a cross with a laurel wreath passing between the arms. The arms of the Cross bear floral symbols representing England (Rose), Scotland (Thistle), Ireland (Shamrock) and Wales (Daffodil). The centre of the Cross bears the crowned Cypher of Her Majesty The Queen. The reverse of the Cross is engraved with the name of the service person in whose memory it is granted. The Elizabeth Cross, accompanied by a miniature version, is presented in a black leather style presentation box with the Royal Cypher on the lid and the Royal Coat of Arms on the inner silk lining.</p>

<p>The Memorial Scroll is on parchment style paper, headed with the Royal Coat of Arms and the following words “This Scroll Commemorates…who gave his/her life for Queen and Country on…” The Scroll bears the signature of Her Majesty The Queen in the upper left hand corner.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p>Eligible personnel to be remembered in this way are those who were serving with, or former members of the Regular and Reserve Armed Forces or the Royal Fleet Auxiliary when deployed in direct support of a designated operation.</p>

<p>The next of kin of eligible personnel whose deaths fall into the following categories are to be recognised:</p>

<ul>
<li>those who died from whatever cause whilst serving on a medal earning operation. Medal earning operations are those in which deployed personnel received a Campaign Medal, <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> or <abbr title="Operational Service Medal">OSM</abbr> which demonstrated the risk and rigour involved. Operations where a UN, NATO or other international body or other nations’ campaign medal was accepted for wear, in the absence of a UK medal also qualify</li>
  <li>those who died as a result of an act of terrorism where the available evidence suggests that the service person, whether on or off duty, was targeted because of his or her membership of the UK Armed Forces</li>
  <li>those who died on a non-medal earning operational task where death has been caused by the inherent high risk of the task</li>
  <li>those who died a subsequent and premature death as a result of an injury or illness attributed to the circumstances outlined above</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to recognising future operational deaths in this way, deaths in the circumstances outlined above that occurred after 1 January 1948, or as a result of service in Palestine since 27 September 1945, will be recognised retrospectively. These dates reflect the fact that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission attributed deaths up to 1 January 1948 to World War 2 service - with the exception of Palestine.</p>

<h3 id="recipients-and-how-to-apply">Recipients and how to apply</h3>

<p>Next of kin can apply for both the Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll. For retrospective claims and when the next of kin is deceased, their legal successor may apply. Only one Elizabeth Cross is granted for each death recognised.</p>

<p>An additional Memorial Scroll only is available to the following (or their legal successors) where they are not the next of kin:</p>

<ul>
<li>the parents of the deceased</li>
  <li>the spouse/partner of the deceased or someone who had a substantive relationship with the deceased</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that as a Memorial Scroll was issued at the time to those who died in the Korean War, the Elizabeth Cross only (and not the new Memorial Scroll) will be issued in remembrance of those who died during that war.</p>

<h3 id="presentation-of-elizabeth-cross-and-memorial-scroll">Presentation of Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll</h3>

<p>For new qualifying deaths after 1 August 2009, it is intended that, in most cases, the next of kin will be offered the opportunity for the Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll to be presented privately and in an appropriate way at the time of the funeral if they so wish.</p>

<p>For retrospective cases, next of kin who are resident in the UK will be offered the choice of whether they wish to receive the Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll at a formal presentation ceremony in the region where they live. Such presentations may be made by a Lord Lieutenant or a senior military representative. It is likely to be some months before these events are arranged as locations will very much depend on the number of recipients living in a particular region and we cannot establish this until applications are received. Further details will be sent to those who are to receive the Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll.</p>

<p>If they prefer, families may choose to receive the Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll by Recorded Delivery post. Next of kin living overseas will normally receive the Elizabeth Cross and Memorial Scroll in this way.</p>

<p>Until 1962 separate <abbr title="General Service Medals">GSMs</abbr> had been issued to Naval personnel (the Naval <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1915) and Army and <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> personnel (the <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1918). The <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1962 was instituted in 1962 to replace these medals and was awarded to personnel of all services for campaigns and operations that fell short of full-scale war.</p>

<p>Since its inception, it has been awarded for 13 such campaigns: ‘Borneo’, ‘Radfan’, ‘South Arabia’, ‘Malay Peninsula’, ‘South Vietnam’, ‘Northern Ireland’, ‘Dhofar’, ‘Lebanon’, ‘Mine Clearance Gulf of Suez’, ‘Gulf’, ‘Kuwait’, ‘N. Iraq and S. Turkey’ and ‘Air Operations Iraq’.</p>

<p>Award of any new Clasps to the <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> was discontinued on 31 December 1999 on the introduction of the new <abbr title="Operational Service Medal">OSM</abbr> on 1 January 2000.</p>

<p>The highest gallantry award for civilians, the <abbr title="George Cross">GC</abbr> is also awarded to military personnel for those acts for which military honours would not normally granted, such as acts of gallantry not in the presence of the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="history-5">History</h3>

<p>As Britain came under intense air attack during the summer of 1940, Winston Churchill introduced a new medal to recognise the many acts of gallantry being performed by civilians. Although awards to recognise civilian gallantry not in presence of the enemy already existed, none held the prestige of the equivalent award for gallantry in battle, the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>The King agreed and in January 1941 the Warrant relating to award of the George Cross was published. Those holders of the Empire Gallantry Medal, Albert Medal and the Edward Medal which had been awarded prior to the introduction of the <abbr title="George Cross">GC</abbr>, were all invited to exchange their awards for the <abbr title="George Cross">GC</abbr>.</p>

<p>To date, 157 <abbr title="George Crosses">GCs</abbr> have been awarded directly, including 4 to women, with 47 of those awarded since 1947. The 3 most recent recipients of the George Cross have been Army personnel serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. One was awarded posthumously for gallantry displayed both before and after sustaining mortal injuries when entering a minefield in Afghanistan. The other 2 were awarded for service in Iraq, for gallantry displayed in a ‘friendly-fire’ incident and for gallantry displayed after receiving severe injuries caused by an Improvised Explosive Device. All were hugely courageous acts, although not in actual presence of the enemy, and therefore were successfully considered for award of the <abbr title="George Cross">GC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="george-medal">George Medal</h2>

<h3 id="about-the-general-service-medal-1918">About the General Service Medal 1918</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1918 was awarded to Army and <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> personnel (Naval personnel were awarded the separate Naval <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1915). It was awarded for a total of 17 campaigns and operations that fell short of full-scale war.</p>

<p>These were: ‘S. Persia’, ‘Kurdistan’, ‘Iraq’, ‘N. W. Persia’, ‘Southern Desert Iraq’, ‘Northern Kurdistan’, ‘Palestine’, ‘S. E. Asia 1945 to 1946’, ‘Bomb and Mine Clearance 1945 1949’, ‘Bomb and Mine Clearance 1945 to 1956’, ‘Palestine 1945 to 1948’, ‘Malaya’, ‘Cyprus’, ‘Near East’, ‘Arabian Peninsula’, ‘Brunei’ and ‘Canal Zone’. A separate Clasp signified each of these campaigns and operations. </p>

<p>Only one <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> was awarded to each service person, no matter how many <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> qualifying areas they served in.</p>

<p>On the first occasion that a service person qualified for a <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr>, the medal was awarded with the relevant Clasp. Should the service person subsequently have been deployed to another <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> qualifying area, then the relevant Clasp only was awarded, to be added to the ribbon and worn above the first Clasp.</p>

<p>The image on the obverse of the medal changed as the reigning monarchs (George V, George VI and Elizabeth II) and their titles changed over the years.</p>

<p>Although the reigning monarch changed during the Suez campaign, Queen Elizabeth II appears on all the <abbr title="General Service Medals">GSMs</abbr> issued for the Canal Zone because it was Queen Elizabeth that approved award of the Clasp to the <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> ‘Canal Zone’.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1918 and the Naval <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1915 were discontinued in 1962 when a new <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> was introduced to be issued to personnel of all services. The <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1962 had a new design on the reverse and a new ribbon.</p>

<h2 id="honours-and-gallantry-awards">Honours and Gallantry Awards</h2>

<h3 id="medals-awarded-for-gallantry-or-distinguished-service">Medals awarded for gallantry or distinguished service</h3>

<p>While the Order of the Bath had been used to recognise acts of gallantry by officers of field rank or above no official awards for gallantry existed until the introduction of the Distinguished Conduct Medal (<abbr title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">DCM</abbr>) in 1854 and the acts of gallantry seen during the Crimean War.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">DCM</abbr> was then awarded to the other ranks in the Army for acts of gallantry. In 1855, the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal was introduced as the Naval equivalent to the <abbr title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">DCM</abbr>, to be awarded to the other ranks in the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr>.</p>

<p>Despite the introduction of these 2 new awards for individual acts of gallantry there was no award that could be bestowed upon junior officers. With the continuation of the war in the Crimea came the realisation that a further prestigious gallantry award for both officers and other ranks in both services was required.</p>

<p>In 1856 the Victoria Cross was instituted for this purpose and it remains the premier award for gallantry for the UK Armed Forces.</p>

<p>Since the Crimean War further awards to recognise gallantry have been introduced, including awards for civilians, and for officers and airmen in the newly-formed <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>. The awards fall into 2 categories: those issued for acts of gallantry on operations in presence of the enemy and those issued for gallantry at all other times.</p>

<p>A significant review of gallantry awards was undertaken by the government in 1993 which resulted in an end to the 2-tier system whereby one type of medal would be issued to officers and a different type to the other ranks.</p>

<p>For example, the Distinguished Conduct Medal, awarded since the Crimea to the other ranks of the Army, and the Distinguished Service Order awarded to officers, both ceased to be awarded on the creation of the new Conspicuous Gallantry Cross which may be awarded to all ranks.</p>

<p>Recipients of these level 1 to level 3 awards may use the appropriate abbreviation (as shown in brackets in the table below) as a post-nominal.</p>

<p>The Iraq Medal is now awarded for 30 days continuous service on Op Telic in Iraq. Air crew are awarded the Medal for 10 sorties into Iraq.</p>

<p>The Iraq Medal with Clasp ‘19 Mar to 28 Apr 2003’ was awarded for 7 days continuous service on Op Telic in Kuwait or Iraq between the dates of the conflict (19 March to 28 April 2003). Air crew were awarded the Medal with Clasp for 2 sorties into Kuwait or Iraq between those dates. Naval personnel were awarded the Medal with Clasp for 7 days continuous service at sea within certain specified geographical boundaries between those dates.</p>

<p>Subsequent tours to Iraq are not recognised by award of bars or numerals. There is no precedent for this in British medals, though it has been the case in NATO medals.

<p>Equally sized central stripes of maroon and dark blue flanked at the edges by narrow stripes of white.</p>

<h3 id="criteria-21">Criteria</h3>

<p>An airman who completes 15 years reckonable service from date of attestation or age 17½, whichever is later, shall be eligible for consideration and their conduct/discipline record will be checked. Airman currently reaching their 15 year point may qualify despite lowered conduct assessments. Awards are only made after a comprehensive check of an airman’s record of service.</p>

<p>As this medal requires the recommendation of the individuals’ commanding officer, it can only be awarded to serving personnel.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2001 an airman who has not yet completed 8 years qualifying service (ie was attested or aged 17½ after 1 April 1993) will become eligible only after 15 years service with consecutive conduct assessments of ‘exemplary’. There are a number of offences/misconduct which would normally preclude award of the <abbr title="Long Service">LS</abbr> and <abbr title="Good Conduct Medal">GCM</abbr>.</p>

<p>An airman who, subsequent to award of the Medal, goes on to complete a further 15 years service shall be eligible for award of the Clasp to the <abbr title="Long Service">LS</abbr> and <abbr title="Good Conduct Medal">GCM</abbr> provided that the conduct/discipline criteria have been met.</p>

<p>An officer shall be eligible for award of the <abbr title="Long Service">LS</abbr> and <abbr title="Good Conduct Medal">GCM</abbr> if 12 or more of the 15 years service has been in the ranks and provided that the other criteria have been met. An officer shall be eligible for award of the Clasp if 22 or more of the 30 years service has been in the ranks and provided that the other criteria have been met.</p>

<p>Prior to 1 December 1977, 18 years service was required for consideration for the <abbr title="Long Service">LS</abbr> and <abbr title="Good Conduct Medal">GCM</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="clasp-17">Clasp</h3>

<p>A silver bar ornamented by the Crown may be issued to <abbr title="Military Cross">MC</abbr> holders performing a further act of such gallantry which would have merited award of the <abbr title="Military Cross">MC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="ribbon-27">Ribbon</h3>

<p>A central stripe of deep purple flanked by equally sized stripes of white.</p>

<h3 id="criteria-23">Criteria</h3>

<p>All ranks of the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr>, <abbr title="Royal Marines">RM</abbr>, Army, and <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> in recognition of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land.</p>

<h3 id="history-7">History</h3>

<p>Instituted in 1914, the Military Cross was issued for gallantry in presence of the enemy to warrant and junior officers of the Army who were ineligible (on account of their rank) for the Distinguished Service Order. During World War 1 it was also available to equivalent ranks in the Royal Naval Division and Royal Marines (<abbr title="Royal Marines">RM</abbr>) and it later became available to equivalent ranks in the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> for acts of gallantry on land.</p>

<p>The equivalent award for the other ranks for gallantry on land in presence of the enemy was the Military Medal which was instituted in 1916 and, like the <abbr title="Military Cross">MC</abbr>, later became available to <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> other ranks serving on the ground.</p>

<p>Following the 1993 review the MM was discontinued and the <abbr title="Military Cross">MC</abbr> became available to all ranks of all services for exemplary gallantry on land in presence of the enemy. It is at a level below the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross and is at the equivalent level to the Distinguished Service Cross (for exemplary gallantry at sea) and the Distinguished Flying Cross (for exemplary gallantry in the air).</p>

<h3 id="ribbon-28">Ribbon</h3>

<p>Crimson flanked at the edges by narrow stripes of white and a narrow white stripe down the centre.</p>

<h3 id="criteria-24">Criteria</h3>

<p>This same medal is issued to personnel in all the services, although the administration procedures differ between them. The eligibility criteria are the same for the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr>, <abbr title="Royal Marines">RM</abbr>, Army and <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>. To become eligible for consideration, other ranks personnel must have 20 years reckonable service, attained the rank of substantive Sergeant (if in the Army or <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>) and be a holder of the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. Officers may be considered on one occasion only, immediately after commissioning, provided they meet the other criteria.</p>

<p>Award of the Medal requires good, faithful, valuable and meritorious service with conduct judged to be irreproachable throughout. The Service Boards look for evidence of particular achievements, whether in the course of military duty or in extra-mural involvement which benefits the service or the public in the field of sport or such things as charitable work. To reinforce the special character of the MSM, limits are placed on the number that may be awarded annually. No more than 49 may be awarded in the <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr>, 3 in the <abbr title="Royal Marines">RM</abbr>, 89 in the Army and 60 in the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>, though historically many fewer than these numbers are actually awarded.</p>

<h3 id="citations">Citations</h3>

<p><abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> citations recommending candidates may be submitted by Commanding Officers no later than 1st April and 1st October each year. Cases are then considered by the Naval Secretary.
Full details are laid out in BR 8748.</p>

<p>In the Army, citations recommending soldiers may be submitted by Commanding Officers no later than 1st April and 1st October each year. Cases are then considered by the Army Medal Board.
Full details are laid out in the QRs Paras 5.392 and 10.006 - 10.007. Additional information was recently published in DIN 2006DIN10-006.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> is currently in the process of reviewing their MSM procedure, with a move to a citation-led process the most likely outcome. A DIN will be published shortly with the results of the review.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-naval-general-service-medal-1915">About the Naval General Service Medal 1915</h3>

<p>The Naval <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1915 was awarded to <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> and <abbr title="Royal Marines">RM</abbr> personnel. It was awarded for a total of 17 campaigns and operations that fell short of full-scale war. (Army and <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> personnel were awarded the separate <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1918.) </p>

<p>These were ‘Persian Gulf 1909 to 1914’, ‘Iraq 1919 to 1920’, ‘N. W. Persia 1919 to 1920’, ‘Palestine 1936 to 1939’, ‘S. E. Asia 1945 to 1946’, ‘Minesweeping 1945 to 1951’, ‘Palestine 1945 to 1948’, ‘Malaya’, ‘Yangtze 1949’, ‘Bomb and Mine Clearance 1945 to 1953’, ‘Bomb and Mine Clearance 1945 to 1956’, ‘Bomb and Mine Clearance Mediterranean’, ‘Cyprus’, ‘Near East’, ‘Arabian Peninsula’, ‘Brunei’ and ‘Canal Zone’. </p>

<p>A separate Clasp signified each of these campaigns and operations. Only one <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> was awarded to each service person, no matter how many <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> qualifying areas they served in.
On the first occasion that a service person qualified for a <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr>, the medal was awarded with the relevant Clasp. Should the service person subsequently have been deployed to another <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> qualifying area, then the relevant Clasp only was awarded, to be added to the ribbon and worn above the first Clasp.</p>

<p>The image on the obverse of the medal changed as the reigning monarchs (George V, George VI and Elizabeth II) and their titles changed over the years.</p>

<p>Although the reigning monarch changed during the Suez campaign, Queen Elizabeth II appears on all the <abbr title="General Service Medals">GSMs</abbr> issued for the Canal Zone because it was Queen Elizabeth that approved award of the Clasp to the <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> ‘Canal Zone’.</p>

<p>The Naval <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1915 and the <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1918 were discontinued in 1962 when a new <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> was introduced to be issued to personnel of all services. The <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr> 1962 had a new design on the reverse and a new ribbon.</p>

<h3 id="campaign-history-6">Campaign History</h3>

<p>At the same time as the campaigns in Africa and Italy, British and American forces were also fighting the Japanese in the Pacific.</p>

<p>This campaign began on 8 December 1941, the day after the Japanese bombed the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. It took place in the sea and air of the Pacific and on the ground with the British defending Malaya and Singapore from Japanese invasion. The Japanese quickly gained superiority in the Pacific and managed to invade Malaya, Singapore, Burma and the Philippines with relative ease.</p>

<p>The campaign on land ended on 15 February 1942 with defeat for the British when Singapore fell and tens of thousands of servicemen were taken prisoner of war by the Japanese. The campaign at sea continued until 2 September 1945.</p>

<h2 id="post-world-war-2-medals">Post-World War 2 medals</h2>

<p>Numerous medals have been issued after World War 2 to recognise service in wars, conflicts and operations around the world.</p>

<p>Service in many of the conflicts has been recognised with award of a Clasp to the <abbr title="General Service Medal">GSM</abbr>. For example, the Clasp ‘Air Operations Iraq’ which was issued to those on operations in support of patrolling the no-fly zone of Iraq between 1991 and 2003.</p>

<p>For service in wars and large-scale conflicts, single, stand-alone medals have often been issued - eg. the South Atlantic Medal for service in the Falklands War in 1982. In some cases a Clasp was also issued with the medal to those who had served in the most dangerous areas during the most hostile period. </p>

<p>Those who served in theatres of operations in specified areas during the actual period of hostilities during the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War were awarded the Clasp inscribed ‘16 Jan to 28 Feb 1991’ with their Gulf Medal.</p>

<p>Medals have also been issued by NATO and the United Nations for service on NATO and UN operations. These medals then require approval for wear which is granted formally by the Queen if it has been recommended by the Defence Services Secretariat. A number of NATO Medals issued for service in the Balkans from 1992 onwards are approved for wear.</p>

<p>Blue with a central stripe of pearl grey bisected by a narrow stripe of rose pink.</p>

<h3 id="awarded-to">Awarded to</h3>

<p>Awarded to civilians for acts of exemplary bravery, at a level below that of the George Medal. The QGM is also awarded to military personnel for those acts for which military honours would not normally be granted, such as acts of exemplary bravery not in presence of the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="history-8">History</h3>

<p>The Queen’s Gallantry Medal was instituted in 1974 to recognise acts of gallantry of a slightly lower degree than that required for the George Cross and George Medal. Previously, these acts of bravery had been recognised by awards in the Order of the British Empire, with the choice of level in that Order being determined not by the degree of gallantry displayed, but by the rank or level of responsibility held by the individual.</p>

<p>By 1974 it was recognised that ranks and levels of responsibility were not relevant when making awards for gallantry, so awards in the Order of the British Empire were discontinued on the introduction of the new Queen’s Gallantry Medal.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Volunteer Reserves Service Medal">VRSM</abbr> was instituted with effect from 1 April 1999 to replace the separate medals that used to be issued to personnel of the separate Reserve Forces. These were the Royal Naval Reserve Decoration and Reserve Long Service and Good Conduct Medal for the Royal Naval and Royal Marine Reserve, the Territorial Decoration and Efficiency Medal (Territorial) for the Territorial Army and the Air Efficiency Award for the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Volunteer Reserves Service Medal">VRSM</abbr> is now issued to both officers and other ranks of the Royal Naval and Royal Marine Reserve, the Territorial Army and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force who have served after 31 March 1999. The previous medals may still be awarded for qualifying service ending before 1 April 1999.</p>

<h3 id="criteria-31">Criteria</h3>

<p>Reserve personnel shall be eligible for award of the <abbr title="Volunteer Reserves Service Medal">VRSM</abbr> after 10 years reckonable service in the Reserve Forces, provided that they have earned training bounty as required by their obligatory training commitment as defined in individual service regulations in 9 out of the 10 qualifying years.</p>

<p>Up to 5 years former regular service may count as half qualifying time, giving a maximum of 2 and a half years eligible service. Complex regulations apply to the use of former service and periods of Full Time Regular Service (FTRS) and Non Permanent Regular Service (NPRS) as qualifying time towards the <abbr title="Volunteer Reserves Service Medal">VRSM</abbr> and the regulations should therefore be studied in detail. Complex regulations also apply to the transition between the former separate service reserve medals and the <abbr title="Volunteer Reserves Service Medal">VRSM</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any additional period of 5 years reckonable service shall merit award of the Clasp to the <abbr title="Volunteer Reserves Service Medal">VRSM</abbr>.
Full details are laid out in DCI JS 53/99 and, also for the RAUXAF, AP3392 Vol 7 Leaflet 702 Annex B.</p>

<h3 id="summary-of-the-medals-and-eligibility-criteria">Summary of the medals and eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>Eight Stars were issued for the campaigns of World War 2. The Stars are a 6-pointed star, in bronze, with the cypher of King George VI in the centre. The title of each Star appears around the cypher and also a different ribbon denotes each separate Star. The colours of the ribbons have symbolic significance and are believed to have been designed personally by King George VI.</p>

<p>Two medals, the Defence Medal and the War Medal, were issued in recognition of general service in World War 2. These are circular medals made in cupro-nickel.</p>

<p>The criteria for the award of medals to those who had fought in World War 2 were finalised in 1948. In accordance with the criteria, the medals were issued un-named.</p>

<p>No more than 5 Stars may be awarded to one person. Regulations relating to the award of the Pacific, Burma, Atlantic, Air Crew Europe and France and Germany Stars prevent this from happening.</p>

<p>Those who would qualify for more are awarded a Clasp with the title of one of the Stars to which they qualify. This Clasp is then attached to the ribbon of one of the other Stars, as laid out in the regulations.</p>

<p>A candidate may qualify for both the Pacific and Burma Stars but is only awarded one of these, which will be the first Star earned. He will then receive a Clasp with the title of the second Star earned which is worn on the ribbon of the first.</p>

<p>Another candidate may qualify for 2 or 3 of the Atlantic, Air Crew Europe and France and Germany Stars. In this instance the first Star earned is awarded. He will then receive a Clasp with the title of the second Star earned to be worn on the ribbon of the first. A third Star or Clasp will not be awarded in this case.</p>

<p>The 1939 to 1945 Star, Africa Star and Italy Star can all be awarded regardless of which other Stars are qualified for.</p>

<p>For examples of the Clasps and which Stars they are worn on, see the pictures of the Stars on the individual pages.</p>
