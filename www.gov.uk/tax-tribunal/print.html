  </header><p>You can appeal to the tax tribunal if you disagree with a tax decision by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, eg a tax assessment or penalty.</p>

<p>You can also appeal if your goods are seized by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or the UK Border Agency.</p>

<h2>Appealing against tax decisions</h2>

<p>You can appeal against a decision about:</p>

<ul>
<li>a direct tax - eg Income Tax, <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax, Corporation Tax or Capital Gains Tax, National Insurance contributions, Statutory Sick Pay</li>
  <li>an indirect tax - eg VAT surcharge, excise duty, Insurance Premium Tax</li>
</ul>
<p>If the decision is about a direct tax, you must <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/complaints-appeals/how-to-appeal/direct-tax.htm" title="appeal to HMRC">appeal to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr></a> first.</p>

<p>If it’s about a tax assessment for an indirect tax, you usually have to pay the tax before you can appeal.</p>

<p>If this will cause you serious problems, ask <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if your case can go ahead without the payment.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Tax credit appeals are dealt with by the <a href="/social-security-child-support-tribunal/overview" title="social security and child support tribunal">social security and child support tribunal</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Appeals about seized goods</h2>

<p>You can appeal to the tribunal if customs or UK Border Agency officers seize your goods and refuse to return them.</p>

<p>You must ask the organisation that seized your goods to review its decision before you appeal to the tribunal.</p>

<h2>Help and advice</h2>

<p>You can represent yourself or find a tax adviser or accountant to help with your appeal.</p>

<p>You usually have to pay your own costs.</p>

<p>You can get free advice from:</p>

<p>This will be held as near as possible to your home or workplace. You’ll usually get at least 14 days’ notice of the date.</p>
