<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the UK, export control requirements apply when you trade in a number of different types of goods, and in many different situations. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>goods that have a military end-use</li>
  <li>goods that can be used for capital punishment or torture</li>
  <li>military goods passing from one third country to another</li>
  <li>controlled goods that are passing through the UK</li>
  <li>technology</li>
  <li>information and technology already in the public domain</li>
  <li>sting sticks</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide contains answers to frequently asked questions relating to these licensing situations. For further information about each of these issues you should read the relevant related guides. For a high level overview about export controls, read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/beginners-guide-to-export-controls">export controls: an introductory guide</a>. </p>

<h2 id="military-end-use-control-faqs">Military End-Use Control: FAQs</h2>

<p>This section provides a list of questions asked at exporter seminars about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes">Military End-Use Control</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>How will I be informed that I require an export licence because of the Military End-Use Control?
    <ul>
<li>Normally, you would be told by the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>) by telephone, email, fax or letter.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Can I challenge a decision to apply for the Military End-Use Control?
    <ul>
<li>Yes. If you believe the assessment is wrong, you should ask for it to be reconsidered. Your reasons should be clearly supported.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>If I have been informed that an export may be controlled under the Military End-Use Control, must I apply for a licence if I still intend to export?
    <ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>If I am aware that the export meets, or may meet, any of the above criteria, should I apply for a licence?
    <ul>
<li>Under the regulation you are required to inform the authorities so that they can decide whether to make the export subject to an authorisation (export licence). If they do, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will inform you accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>How do I apply for a licence?
    <ul>
<li>In the same way as for any export licence. See the guide on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-control-licensing-process-and-how-to-appeal">export control licensing process and how to appeal</a>.
All licence applications should be made via the SPIRE licensing system. You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login">apply for an export licence using SPIRE.</a>
</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>If the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> informs me that no licence is required, does that advice apply to all exports of those items to that destination?
    <ul>
<li>No, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s advice would apply to that export only.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>What happens after I apply for a licence?
    <ul>
<li>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will process the licence application in the usual way. It will be checked to ensure it has been completed fully and correctly and that the necessary technical specifications and documentation on End-Use and end-user have been supplied.</li>
      <li>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> and their advisers will then consider the application and, because you would not have applied for a licence unless you had been informed or were aware of the possible or intended Military End-Use of the export in question, they will give it particular scrutiny. The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will consider your licence application in the light of the information you provide and any other information available to them.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Am I likely to get a licence?
    <ul>
<li>A licence is likely to be refused if - after detailed assessment - there is judged to be a risk that either the proposed export of dual-use items not otherwise subject to control is or may be intended, in its entirety or in part, for incorporation into military items listed in the military list of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states, for its development, production or maintenance, or for use in a plant for producing it, and the destination is subject to an arms embargo decided by a common position or joint action adopted by the Council; a decision of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe; or an arms embargo imposed by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations</li>
      <li>The licence is also likely to be refused if there is judged to be a risk that the proposed export of Dual-Use items is intended for use as parts or components of military items listed in the military list of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state that have been exported from that member state without authorisation, whatever the destination</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>But what, if after being told we do not need a licence, the items are stopped at the port?
    <ul>
<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) have responsibility for the enforcement of export controls and may wish to check whether any items that are to be exported require a licence. If you applied for a licence but were advised that no licence was required, you must inform <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You should quote your <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> or licence application reference number or include with your export documentation a copy of the letter stating that the items do not appear to require a licence.</li>
      <li>If <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> still believe that there may be grounds for suspicion, they will seek advice from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. If the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> find that there are sufficient concerns about the destination or End-Use, appropriate action will be taken, depending on the circumstances. This might include informing you that you should apply for a licence under the Military End-Use Control.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>So, for example, if I am exporting civil vehicle parts to Pakistan which will be incorporated into something military, which will then be supplied to Uzbekistan (a country embargoed by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, but not by Pakistan), will I need a UK export licence?
    <ul>
<li>Yes. If the immediate destination of your goods wishes to supply a destination subject to a UK-observed embargo that is a matter for them. If you are aware or are informed, however, that your goods are intended to ultimately be supplied as part of an item described in the UK Military List to a destination subject to an embargo observed by the UK you would require a UK export licence.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>What if I’m uncertain about how the law applies in a particular case?
    <ul>
<li>If in doubt, seek expert technical and legal advice.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="eu-torture-regulation-scope-of-goods-faqs">
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Torture Regulation scope of goods: FAQs</h2>

<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the scope of the <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_200/l_20020050730en00010019.pdf"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation on Products used for Capital Punishment and Torture (the Torture Regulation)</a>, as amended. Further guidance is available in the related guide about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/controls-on-torture-goods">controls on torture goods</a>. </p>

<ol>
<li>Does the Regulation weaken national export control restrictions?
    <ul>
<li>The scope of the controls in the Regulation is generally greater than the former UK controls. For instance, there are now controls on gallows and guillotines, electric chairs, air-tight vaults, thumb cuffs and thumb screws. The Regulation raises the level of export control across Europe as many member states previously had no controls in this area.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Why was it necessary to remove national controls once the Regulation entered into force?
    <ul>
<li>Competence on the export of goods listed in the Regulation now rests with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. As the Regulation is directly applicable in all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states, overlapping national legislation was revoked. This does not reduce the level of control, but simply ensures that <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and national legislation mesh together properly.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Why can’t we simply add extra torture equipment to our national legislation where this is identified as not covered by the Regulation?
    <ul>
<li>The Regulation is now the prime source of European controls on the export of goods used for capital punishment or torture. To be most effective, agreement to control the export of such goods should be sought from all the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>The list of controlled goods is very limited, there must be many items which can be used for capital punishment or torture and are not listed. Will member states be able to introduce a wider range of military, security and police equipment into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade Regulation?
    <ul>
<li>The list of goods in the Regulation was proposed by the European Commission and negotiated with the member states in the Council. The preamble (23) in the Regulation indicates that the list of goods in the Regulation should be kept under review and Articles 12 and 15 set out the procedures for making changes.</li>
      <li>The UK works with other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states to introduce additional equipment for control under the Regulation where appropriate and necessary.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Will the national control on electric shock dart guns be maintained?
    <ul>
<li>Yes. The government will maintain its controls on exports on electric shock dart guns to all destinations.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>By deleting PL5001.g from national controls and relying instead on the more restricted definition contained in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade Regulation, will some electro-shock devices cease to be controlled, eg electro-shock devices which operate at a voltage level below 10,000 volts?
    <ul>
<li>The reference to no-load voltage exceeding 10,000 volts relates to electric shock dart guns. All electric shock dart guns, whether with a no-load voltage, above or below 10,000 volts, will continue to be controlled in the UK.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Will export controls on ‘ordinary handcuffs’ be added to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade Regulation?
    <ul>
<li>The Regulation is now the prime source of control for handcuffs with the exception of the derogation for handcuffs between 240 and 280 millimetres. It is now for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to decide on any changes to the Regulation.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Will UK national controls on individual cuffs, controlled under PL5001c.5, be maintained, and will the UK encourage the European Commission and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states to include this equipment description in Annex III of the Trade Regulation?
    <ul>
<li>The control in the Regulation applies to individual cuffs irrespective of size and goes further than the PL5001.c 5 control, which is limited by the internal dimensions of the cuffs. Therefore, it is unnecessary to maintain the national control.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Does the UK government consider that having leg-irons or leg-cuffs in Annex III in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade Regulation contradicts UK support for Article 33 of the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners in relation to the use, and export, of leg-irons or leg-cuffs?
    <ul>
<li>This point was considered during the negotiation of the Regulation. Article 7(1) of the Regulation allows member states to maintain national prohibition on these goods. The UK will maintain a national prohibition.</li>
    </ul>

<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Torture Regulation trade controls and other licensing situations: FAQs</h2>

<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about trade controls and other aspects of licensing under the 
<a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_200/l_20020050730en00010019.pdf"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation on Products used for Capital Punishment and Torture (the ‘Torture’ Regulation)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="trade-controls">Trade controls</h3>

<ol>
<li>With the Regulation now in force are the existing controls on trafficking and brokering (trade) of ‘torture equipment’ maintained?
    <ul>
<li>Yes. The Regulation does not control trade, but the provisions on trade controls in the Export Control Order 2008 are applied to the goods controlled by the Regulation, as well as maintaining all existing national trade controls. Therefore, a trade licence will be required before trafficking and brokering can be carried out.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Will the UK be working to introduce effective brokering controls across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>?
    <ul>
<li>The UK supports brokering controls, and continues to apply national trade controls to equipment in the Regulation and encourage other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states to do the same.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Will the UK government use the options in the Regulation to ensure that the strict export controls introduced in July 1997 and brokering controls implemented in April 2004 are retained?
    <ul>
<li>Yes. The Regulation allows member states to impose stricter controls on the goods which are specified in Articles 7(1) and (2). Article 7(1) allows member states to maintain a prohibition on the export of leg-irons, gang chains and portable electric shock devices. Article 7(2) allows member states to impose an authorisation requirement on the export of handcuffs exceeding 240 millimetres when locked. The UK will apply these provisions.</li>
      <li>The Regulation does not control brokering but the UK will continue to apply trade controls as explained above.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-licensing-situations">Other licensing situations</h3>

<ol>
<li>What about controls on intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> transfers?
    <ul>
<li>Now there is a harmonised regime on exports from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, there is no need in principle for controls on transfers to other member states. However, they are maintained in certain cases where the UK has tougher controls than the Regulation or to maintain previous national controls.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Why does the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation only apply to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states?
    <ul>
<li>As with all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> export regulations, the Torture Regulation only deals with external trade to and from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>What about transhipment controls?
    <ul>
<li>The Regulation controls the transhipment in and out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> of goods listed in Annex II of the Regulation. For goods in Annex III where transhipment controls currently exist in the UK, these will be maintained where this is possible.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Could the lack of transit controls be in breach of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states’ obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment?
    <ul>
<li>Transit controls apply in respect of goods in Annex II. For goods listed in Article 7(1) national transhipment controls can be maintained. The UK will continue to maintain transit controls on Article 7(1) goods, ie leg-irons, gang-chains and portable electric shock devices.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Does the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade Regulation control technical assistance whereby person(s) supply such assistance once they have travelled outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> territory?
    <ul>
<li>Technical assistance controls apply (see Articles 3 and 4 of the Regulation) to those Annex II goods prohibited for import and export.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="trade-controls-trafficking-and-brokering-of-military-goods-faqs">Trade Controls (Trafficking and Brokering) of military goods: FAQs</h2>

<ol>
<li>What are the trade controls?
    <ul>
<li>Trade means trafficking and brokering of military goods, in other words, the UK involvement in deals which result in the movement of military goods from one third country to another.</li>
      <li>For more information, see our page on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-controls-military-goods-on-trade-fairs-and-exhibitions">current guidance on trade in military goods</a> in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-controls-on-controlled-military-goods">trafficking and brokering (trade controls)</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>If we have a trade licence in place for a certain deal, will we still need to obtain an export licence from the source destination for the goods to leave that country?
    <ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>What if we are arranging for technology for military goods to be moved from one third country to another?
    <ul>
<li>The trade controls do not apply to software or technology, unless it relates to ‘restricted goods’ or movement to an embargoed destination as ‘any act calculated to promote…’ would probably include the transferral of related technology.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="transit-or-transhipment-goods-faqs">Transit or transhipment goods: FAQs</h2>

<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about licensing requirements for goods transiting the UK.</p>

<ol>
<li>What do you mean by transit/transhipment?
    <ul>
<li>This means that goods are passing through the UK.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Do I need a licence for goods in transit/being transhipped?
    <ul>
<li>This varies. Most controlled goods do not need a licence provided certain conditions are met. There are also a number of exceptions.</li>
      <li>See more information on transhipment licences in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transit-and-transhipment">transit and transhipment</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>What if software is added to the goods when they arrive in the UK?
    <ul>
<li>Then work will be done on the goods, they will have been imported into the UK and an export licence will be needed to export the goods from the UK.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-export-of-technology-faqs">The export of technology: FAQs</h2>

<p>The following is a selection of common questions which are often raised at the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s exporter seminars and workshops. See also further guidance about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-of-technology">export of technology</a>. </p>

<ol>
<li>Can you explain what you mean by ‘technology’?
    <ul>
<li>‘Technology’ is information relating to goods and software. For example, blueprints, plans, diagrams, models, formulae, tables, designs, specifications, manuals and instructions.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Is all technology controlled?
    <ul>
<li>Except in certain cases, technology is only controlled if it is required for the development, production or use of listed goods or software, or if the technology itself is specifically described in the UK Strategic Export Control Lists. See the guide on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">UK strategic export control lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items</a>.</li>
      <li>‘Required’, ‘development’, ‘production’ and ‘use’ are themselves defined terms which need to be understood in order to determine whether a piece of ‘information’ is controlled. In addition, there are exemptions for technology ‘in the public domain’, which is ‘basic scientific research’ or is the minimum necessary for making patent applications.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>What happens if the technology can be used both for licensable and No Licence Required (NLR) goods?
    <ul>
<li>If the technology is capable of being ‘required’ for licensable goods, then a licence will be needed, even if it is being exported or transferred in connection with NLR goods.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>How can technology be transferred?
    <ul>
<li>Technology can be transferred by physical means, such as posting or hand-carrying a document overseas, or by carrying a laptop or memory device on which the technology is stored.</li>
      <li>It can also be transferred by electronic means such as email, fax, file downloads and transfers, or by remote access from overseas.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Do I therefore need to apply for a licence every time I want to send an email?
    <ul>
<li>No. A licence is issued to cover a project or series of transactions.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Does a telephone conversation constitute a transfer of technology?
    <ul>
<li>Only if you are reading out a document word for word and it is being transcribed at the other end.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Is an export licence required when I place information on a server in the UK if the information is going to be accessed from overseas?
    <ul>
<li>Yes, since it involves the act of being accessed overseas.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>I want to place data on a server which is physically located overseas but the data will only be accessed by UK-based employees. Do I need an export licence?
    <ul>
<li>If you can ensure that information is not accessed from outside the UK (including by system administrators), then you would not need a licence.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Do I require an export licence for information which is in my head?
    <ul>
<li>No.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Does providing a service such as repair, training or consultancy constitute technology transfer?
    <ul>
<li>No. This is known as Technical Assistance. However, if a service engineer takes documentation overseas in servicing goods or technology then the documentation would be licensable. You would need to consider this aspect if using technology.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>When do we need to have licences to transfer technology within the UK?
    <ul>
<li>If the technology meets the definition of ‘any relevant use’ and is going to be used for that purpose outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, a licence will be needed to transfer the technology within the UK.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>How does the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> control electronic transfers?
    <ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> expects companies to demonstrate compliance. Whilst it is hard to police this and prove when an electronic transfer is made, emails can be tracked and examined. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will use intelligence reports to identify those not complying with the controls. Essentially, if the technology needs a licence to be exported or transferred, get a licence in place and ensure full compliance.</li>
      <li>You should be aware that you risk prosecution - either a fine or a jail sentence - along with attendance of loss of business reputation - for misuse of technology. For further information see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology">compliance and enforcement of export controls</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Do licences for technology have a time limit?
    <ul>
<li>The only Open General Licence (<abbr title="Open General Licence">OGL</abbr>) that has a time limit is the remote access <abbr title="Open General Licence">OGL</abbr>. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-goods-ogels">Military Goods Open General Export Licences</a>. Those using it have to be out of the country for a period of time of less than three months. Open Individual Licences are usually valid for up to five years.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>What does ‘in the public domain’ mean?
    <ul>
<li>In the public domain means the information is made available without any restrictions, other than copyright, being placed on further dissemination. For instance, information you place on your website that anyone can download or that you publish in a sales brochure would be ‘in the public domain’.</li>
      <li>However, if the information has a security classification or you require a non-disclosure agreement to be in place before you share it or if there are any other intellectual property restrictions, then the information is clearly not in the public domain.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>If a drawing is ‘in the public domain’, but the goods it refers to are licensable, does the drawing need a licence?
    <ul>
<li>No, technology ‘in the public domain’ does not need a licence.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>The information needed to design our type of product is all available in text books. Surely then our technology is in the public domain? 
    <ul>
<li>Only if your specific technology is freely available without restriction is it considered to be in the public domain. The availability of generic information or of similar information from other sources is irrelevant. You would need a licence in both cases.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Our product contains software which is open source. Does that mean our product does not need a licence?
    <ul>
<li>The answer to both questions is the same.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<h2 id="sting-sticks-faqs">Sting sticks: FAQs</h2>

<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about sting sticks (which are specific goods used for torture). See also guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/controls-on-torture-goods">controls on torture goods</a>. </p>

<ol>
<li>What is a ‘sting stick’?
    <ul>
<li>For the purpose of these controls a ‘sting stick’ is any type of hand-held, spiked baton.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Why has the government decided to introduce controls on the export and trading of so called sting sticks?
    <ul>
<li>Following the <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090902183635/berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/europeandtrade/strategic-export-control/legislation/export-control-act-2002/review/index.html">review of export control legislation 2007</a>, which included an extensive public consultation exercise, the government made a commitment in its initial response to the views and recommendations it received to extend the current export and trade controls to cover sting sticks.</li>
      <li>The government considers that sting sticks are, by their nature, designed for the purposes of torture or similar inhumane acts and have no other legitimate use. Therefore, the government believes that, in common with other equipment of a similar nature, the UK should apply the most stringent level of controls on the export and trading of sting sticks.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Will there be new controls on the import and domestic possession of sting sticks?
    <ul>
<li>Controls on the import and domestic possession of sting sticks will not be introduced as part of this amendment. However, the government will consider whether an import prohibition should be introduced on sting sticks in due course.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Do these controls apply extraterritorially?
    <ul>
<li>Yes. These controls apply to the export of sting sticks from the UK and the trading of sting sticks between one third country and another third country, where any part of that trading takes place within the UK, or where it takes place anywhere in the world if carried out by a UK person.</li>
    </ul>
