  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="how-the-green-deal-works"><header><h1>Part 1: How the Green Deal works</h1>
  </header><p>You can make energy-saving improvements to your home or business without having to pay all the costs up front through the Green Deal. </p>

<p>Energy-saving improvements include: </p>

<ul>
<li>insulation - eg loft or cavity wall insulation</li>
  <li>heating </li>
  <li>draught-proofing</li>
  <li>double glazing</li>
  <li>renewable energy technologies - eg solar panels or wind turbines</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting involved</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="/green-deal-energy-saving-measures/getting-an-assessment" title="Getting an assessment">Get an assessment</a> of your property - this will tell you what improvements you can make and estimate how much you could save on your energy bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a <a href="http://www.greendealorb.co.uk/providers/provider-search" title="Find a Green Deal provider" rel="external">Green Deal provider</a> to carry out the work. You discuss with them what work you want done and whether the Green Deal is right for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you go ahead with the improvements you must sign your Green Deal Plan - this is a contract between you and the provider stating what work will be done and how much it will cost. The provider will then arrange for a Green Deal installer to do the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the work is done, you’ll <a href="/green-deal-energy-saving-measures/repayments" title="Green Deal repayments">pay off the money</a> in instalments through your electricity bill</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can get an assessment now, but work can’t start until 28 January 2013.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re a landlord, you must get your tenant’s permission before you sign up, and if you’re a tenant you must get your landlord’s permission to sign up - this also applies to social housing.</p>

</article><article id="getting-an-assessment"><header><h1>Part 2: Getting an assessment</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need to choose an authorised <a rel="external" href="http://www.greendealorb.co.uk/assessors/assessor-search" title="Find a Green Deal assessor">Green Deal assessor.</a> They will visit your home, talk to you about your property and your energy use and tell you whether you could benefit from Green Deal improvements. </p>

<p>You’ll be given a Green Deal Advice Report - this will explain what improvements you can make and estimate how much you could save on your energy bills.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may have to pay for an assessment - you should check with the assessor before the appointment.</p>
</div>

<p>If the assessor intends to quote for improvements, or recommend specific products or providers, they’ll need your permission before they do the assessment. </p>

<p><img src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/static/green_deal_quality_mark.jpg" width="195" height="204" align="right"></p>

<h2>Green Deal mark</h2>

<p>Green Deal assessors must be authorised to act under the Green Deal - look for the Green Deal Approved Quality Mark.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Green Deal providers and installers must also be authorised - they will display the quality mark if they are.</p>
</div>

<h2>After the assessment</h2>

<p>Contact a <a rel="external" href="http://www.greendealorb.co.uk/providers/provider-search" title="Find a Green Deal provider">Green Deal provider</a> - they will discuss with you what work is right for you and arrange for any work to be done.</p>

<p>You can get quotes from as many providers as you like - you don’t have to choose all, or any, of their recommendations.</p>

</article><article id="repayments"><header><h1>Part 3: Repayments</h1>
  </header><p>The amount you repay for Green Deal improvements is based on what a typical household is expected to save on energy bills by having the work done. </p>

<p>The cost will be shown on your Green Deal Plan (the contract between you and the provider), and will include the interest rate.</p>

<p>Most improvements should reduce your heating bill because you’ll be using less electricity, gas or oil - but the actual savings depend on your energy use and the future cost of energy.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Before you sign your Green Deal Plan, check you understand the repayment rules.</p>
</div>

<h2>How you repay</h2>

<p>You’ll pay the money back through your electricity bill. This is so that the Green Deal stays with the house - ie if you move, you no longer benefit from the improvements and therefore stop paying for them.</p>

<p>If you have a prepayment meter, a small amount will be taken from the meter each day instead.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can pay off your Green Deal early, but you might be charged a fee - check with your provider.</p>
</div>

<h2>Help with costs</h2>

<p>If you’re on benefits, a low income or live in an old property, you may be able to get help with costs. Contact the Energy Saving Advice Service.</p>

</article><article id="moving-into-a-property-with-a-green-deal"><header><h1>Part 4: Moving into a property with a Green Deal</h1>
  </header><p>If you move into a property with a Green Deal, the landlord or seller must show you a copy of the Energy Performance Certificate - this will explain what improvements have been made and how much you’ll need to repay.</p>

<p>The person who pays the electricity bill pays the money back - so if you’re a tenant in a rented property, you’ll be paying back the costs, not the landlord. This is because the tenant can expect to benefit from lower energy costs.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can change electricity supplier, but only if the new supplier is participating in the Green Deal.</p>
</div>

<h2>Get more information</h2>

<p>If you have questions about improvements, warranties or repayments, contact the Green Deal provider - their contact details will be on your Energy Performance Certificate.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint and it can’t be dealt with by the Green Deal provider or supplier, contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ombudsman-services.org/green-deal.html" title="Green Deal Ombudsman">Green Deal Ombudsman.</a></p>

</article><article id="cashback-scheme"><header><h1>Part 5: Cashback scheme</h1>
  </header><p>You may be able to claim back money from the government if you make energy saving improvements to your home under the Green Deal. </p>

<p>The scheme will run for a limited period, and is available for householders (eg home-owners, tenants etc). Landlords are eligible if they pay for installation.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can choose to donate some or all of your cashback to a charity or community interest company signed up with the scheme.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Householders can’t apply until January 2013.</p>
</div>

<p>For more information on the scheme, and to see what improvements you’ll be able to claim for, see the <a rel="external" href="http://gdcashback.decc.gov.uk/" title="How to apply for Green Deal Cashback">Green Deal Cashback</a> website.</p>

<p>If you’re a provider wanting to help customers get involved, or a charity wanting to receive donations, you’ll need to <a rel="external" href="http://gdcashback.decc.gov.uk/" title="Register: providers and charities">register.</a></p>
