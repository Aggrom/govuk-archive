Choose a [Green Deal advisor](http://www.greendealorb.co.uk/certification-bodies/certification-body-search \"Find a Green Deal advisor\"){:rel=\"external\"} - they'll write a report on your property telling you what improvements you can make and estimate how much you could save on your energy bills.  \r\n\r\ns2. Choose a [Green Deal provider](http://www.greendealorb.co.uk/providers/provider-search \"Find a Green Deal provider\"){:rel=\"external\"} to carry out the work. They must explain what work will be done and how much it will cost - this is know as a 'Green Deal plan'. How much you can spend is up to the Green Deal provider. \r\n\r\ns3. If you go ahead with the improvements you must sign your Green Deal Plan - this is a contract between you and the provider. The provider will then arrange for a Green Deal installer to do the work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Costs \r\n\r\nCheck if the advisor's assessment is free or if there is a fee. \r\n\r\nYou pay in instalments through your electricity bill. The actual amount will be shown on your Green Deal plan. You may get help with the costs if you're on benefits, a low income or living in an older property.\r\n\r\nUsually your bills won't go up because you shouldn't pay back more than the savings you're making as a result of the improvements. The actual savings depend on your energy use and the future cost of energy. \r\n\r\nYou can be charged interest on your repayments and there may be penalties if you repay the money early. \r\n\r\n% Before you sign your Green Deal plan - check you understand the repayment rules. % \r\n\r\n##Green Deal contacts  \r\n\r\n$C **Energy Saving Advice Service**  \r\n0300 123 1234  \r\nMonday to Friday 9am to 8pm  \r\nSaturday 10am to 2pm\r\n$C\r\n\r\n$C **Energy Saving Scotland**  \r\n0800 512 012  \r\nMonday to Friday 9am to 5pm  \r\n$C","slug":"green-deal","title":"Green Deal"}},{"table":{"body":"Some energy companies might pay for all or part of the cost of installing things like:\r\n\r\n+ loft, solid wall or cavity wall insulation\r\n+ boiler repairs or replacements (if you qualify) \r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a customer of the energy company but you must own your home or rent privately and have permission from the owner for the work.
