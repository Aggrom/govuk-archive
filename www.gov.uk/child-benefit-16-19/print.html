<ul>
<li>GCSEs</li>
  <li>A levels</li>

</ul>
<h2>Study abroad</h2>

<p>If your child’s studying abroad, you can usually only get Child Benefit for the first 12 weeks they’re away. You’ll keep getting it after this if they’re only abroad because they’re either:</p>

<ul>
<li>on an educational exchange or visit (with written agreement from their school or college)</li>
  <li>in education that counts for Child Benefit in a country in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>all <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="countries in the EU">countries in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein</li>

</article><article id="breaks-in-education-or-training"><header><h1>Part 4: Breaks in education or training</h1>
  </header><p>You may get Child Benefit for 6 months if the break is for a good reason, eg your child is ill, changing course or pregnant.</p>

<p>You may be able to get Child Benefit for longer than 6 months if you’re still spending money on your child in certain circumstances, eg if they’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>in <a href="/child-benefit-hospital-residential-care" title="Child Benefit if your child is in hospital or residential care">hospital or residential care</a>
</li>
  <li>getting medical treatment abroad</li>
</ul>
<h2>Voluntary breaks</h2>

<p>You can’t normally get Child Benefit if your child has taken a voluntary break in education or training, eg if they travel overseas for personal reasons.</p>

<h2>After the break</h2>

<p>If your child goes back to education or training after a break, you should <a href="/child-benefit/how-to-claim" title="claim Child Benefit">make a new claim</a> if your Child Benefit has stopped.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p><strong>If your child doesn’t go back into eligible education or training, you may have to pay back some of the payments you got during the break.</strong></p>
</div>


</article><article id="your-child-leaves-education-or-training"><header><h1>Part 5: Your child leaves education or training</h1>
  </header><p>If your child leaves education or training at or after 16, your Child Benefit payments normally carry on for a while. </p>

<p>When they stop depends on things like when your child’s birthday is, or the reasons why they left the education or training.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>When your child leaves</th>
      <th>When payments stop</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The year they turn 16</td>
      <td>After 31 August following their 16th birthday (if your child turns 16 on 31 August, payments stop then)</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>After age 16</td>
      <td>Last day of February, 31 May, 31 August or 30 November - whichever comes first</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>Your child is 16 and gets their exam results in July. The results mean they can’t do the course they wanted so they’ve chosen to start work instead. </p>

<p>Child Benefit payments will stop on 31 August.</p>
</div>

<p>You can apply for a <a href="child-benefit-extensions" title="Child Benefit extensions">20-week extension of Child Benefit</a> if your child is under 18 and leaves education or training if they register with local careers services or the armed forces.</p>

<p>Child Benefit stops straightaway if your child:</p>

<ul>

  <li>gets certain benefits (ie Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, tax credits, Incapacity Benefit or income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance)</li>

</div>

<h2>Your child returns to school or college for exams</h2>

<p>If your child was entered for exams before they left school or college, you can normally still get Child Benefit.</p>

<p>The exams must be for the course they were doing before they left - and the course must have been an eligible <a href="education" title="education that counts for Child Benefit">education</a> or <a href="training" title="training that counts for Child Benefit">training</a> course.</p>

<ul>
<li>the last day of February</li>
  <li>31 May</li>
  <li>31 August</li>
  <li>30 November</li>
</ul>
<h2>If your child leaves education but then goes back</h2>

<p>If your child returns to education or training and it counts for Child Benefit, you can make another claim.</p>

<p>Your child needs to have started, enrolled or been accepted on a course before their 19th birthday.</p>
