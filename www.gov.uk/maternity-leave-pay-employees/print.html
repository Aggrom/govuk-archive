  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="entitlement"><header><h1>Part 1: Entitlement</h1>
  </header><h2>Statutory Maternity Leave</h2>

<p>Eligible employees can take up to 52 weeks maternity leave. The first 26 weeks is known as ‘Ordinary Maternity Leave’, the last 26 weeks as ‘Additional Maternity Leave’. </p>

<p>The earliest leave can be taken is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth. Employees must take at least 2 weeks after the birth (or 4 weeks if they’re a factory worker). </p>

<p>Other types of <a href="/employee-rights-when-on-leave" title="Employee right to accrue leave">leave</a>  are still accrued (built up) and can be taken before or after maternity leave (eg annual leave) but not during it. </p>

<h2>Statutory Maternity Pay</h2>

<p>Statutory Maternity Pay for eligible employees can be paid for up to 39 weeks, usually as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>the first 6 weeks - 90% of their average weekly earnings (<abbr title="Average weekly earnings">AWE</abbr>) before tax</li>
  <li>the remaining 33 weeks - £135.45 or 90% of their <abbr title="Average weekly earnings">AWE</abbr> (whichever is lower) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tax and National Insurance need to be deducted. </p>

<h2>Extra leave or pay</h2>

<p>You can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company maternity scheme. You must make sure your maternity leave and pay policies are clear and easily accessible to staff.</p>

<h2>If the baby is born early</h2>

<p>Leave starts the day after the birth if the baby is born early. </p>

<p>The employee has to confirm the actual date of birth - they don’t have to do this in writing unless you request it. You will have to write to them confirming the new end date for their leave. </p>

<h2>If the baby dies</h2>

<p>Employees still qualify for leave or pay if the baby is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>stillborn from 24 weeks of pregnancy</li>
  <li>born alive at any point during the pregnancy</li>
</ul></article><article id="eligibility-and-proof-of-pregnancy"><header><h1>Part 2: Eligibility and proof of pregnancy</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Some employees won’t qualify for both leave and pay.</p>
</div>

<h2>Statutory Maternity Leave</h2>

<p>Employees must: </p>

<ul>
<li>have an <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="Employment contracts and conditions">employment contract</a> - it doesn’t matter how long they’ve worked for you</li>
  <li>give you the <a href="/maternity-leave-pay-employees/notice-period" title="Notice period">correct notice</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Statutory Maternity Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Employees must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have worked for you for at least 26 weeks up to the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth</li>
  <li>be on your payroll and earn at least £107 a week in an 8 week period</li>
  <li>give you the <a href="/maternity-leave-pay-employees/notice-period" title="Notice periods">correct notice</a>
</li>
  <li>give you proof they’re pregnant </li>
</ul>
<p>Employees not entitled to <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr> may be able to get <a href="/maternity-allowance" title="Maternity Allowance">Maternity Allowance</a> instead. </p>

<h2>Proof of pregnancy</h2>

<p>You must get proof of the pregnancy before you pay <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr>. This is usually a doctor’s letter or an MATB1 certificate (midwives and doctors usually issue these 20 weeks before the due date). </p>

<p>The employee should give you proof within 21 days of the <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr> start date. You can agree to accept it later if you want. You <a href="/maternity-leave-pay-employees/refusing-leave-or-pay" title="Refusing SMP">don’t have to pay <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr></a> if you haven’t received proof of the due date 13 weeks after the <abbr title="Statutory Maternity Pay">SMP</abbr> start date. </p>

<p>Notice doesn’t have to be in writing unless you request it.</p>

<h2>Statutory Maternity Leave</h2>

<p>Employees must tell you at least 15 weeks before the baby is expected the date: </p>

<ul>
<li>the baby is due</li>
  <li>they want to start their maternity leave - they can change this with 28 days’ notice</li>
</ul>
<p>You have 28 days to write confirming their leave start and end date. Use the <a href="/maternity-allowance" title="Maternity Allowance">maternity planning tool</a> to work out these dates. </p>

<p>Employees can change their return date to work if they give 8 weeks’ notice. </p>

<h2>Statutory Maternity Pay</h2>

<p>Employees must give you 28 days notice. You have 7 days to write confirming: </p>

<ul>
<li>they’re eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay</li>
  <li>how much they’ll get </li>
  <li>when the pay will start and stop </li>
</ul>
<h2>Late notice</h2>

<p>You can’t refuse maternity leave or change the amount of leave employees want to take.</p>

<p>You can delay the leave or pay start date if the employee doesn’t have a reasonable excuse for giving you the wrong amount of notice. To delay it, write to them within 28 days of their leave request.</p>
