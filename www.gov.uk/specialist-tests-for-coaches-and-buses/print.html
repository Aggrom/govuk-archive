  </header><p>Commercial vehicles are tested every year to make sure they’re roadworthy and comply with any relevant regulations. This is known as <a href="/annual-test-for-lorries-buses-and-trailers" title="The annual test for lorries, buses and trailers">the annual test</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the annual test, there are extra tests coaches and buses may need to take to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure they have safe access for disabled passengers that meets legal standards</li>
  <li>qualify for a lower rate of vehicle tax (commonly known as road tax) by getting a Reduced Pollution Certificate</li>
  <li>qualify for free entrance to the London low emission zone by getting a Reduced Pollution Certificate or Low Emission Certificate</li>

<p>You’ll need to get a <a href="/specialist-tests-for-coaches-and-buses/pre-registration-inspection" title="Pre Registration Inspection">Pre Registration Inspection (<abbr title="Pre Registration Inspection">PRI</abbr>)</a> to register a passenger vehicle for private use that doesn’t need <a href="/vehicle-approval/overview" title="Vehicle approval">approval</a> and has more than 8 passenger seats.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="accessibility-certificate-test"><header><h1>Part 2: Accessibility Certificate test</h1>
  </header><p>Some buses and coaches must have accessibility features for wheelchair users, like boarding lifts and ramps, wheelchair spaces and wheelchair restraints.</p>

<p>This affects buses and coaches, which:</p>

<ul>
<li>are authorised to carry more than 22 passengers</li>
  <li>carry passengers at separate fares on local or scheduled services</li>
  <li>were first used on or after 31 December 2000</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturers of buses and coaches usually apply for these Accessibility Certificates at the same time as the Certificate of Initial Fitness (<abbr title="Certificate of Initial Fitness">COIF</abbr>) when the vehicles are first built. </p>

<p>If you have a <abbr title="Certificate of Initial Fitness">COIF</abbr>, but no Accessibility Certificate from the manufacturer, you can apply for one separately. You can also apply for an Accessibility Certificate yourself if you convert a vehicle to be used as a bus or coach.</p>

<p>Accessibility Certificates last the lifetime of the vehicle as long as you don’t make any further alterations to it. Once you have an Accessibility Certificate, accessibility is then checked as part of the vehicle’s annual test.</p>

<p>To apply for an Accessibility Certificate, fill in form PSVA1.</p>

<h2>Fees for the Accessibility Certificate test</h2>

<p>You’ll need to check both wheelchair accessibility and general accessibility. Each of these sets of regulations is called a schedule.</p>

  </header><p>If you modify a bus or coach to cut its emissions, you can get it tested by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) for a Reduced Pollution Certificate (<abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>). The certificate reduces the cost of the vehicle excise duty (commonly known as road tax).</p>

<p>Some RPCs also mean you can drive the vehicle in the Low Emission Zone (<abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr>) without charge. The <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> covers most of Greater London and heavy diesel vehicles are charged to enter the area.</p>

<p>Some vehicles that don’t qualify for an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> can still get a Low Emissions Certificate (<abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>) – this means they can be driven in the <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> without charge, but their road tax will stay the same.</p>

<p>You can have the tests done as part of your annual test, or separately. It’s cheaper as part of the annual test.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> test</h2>

<p>To get an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>, a bus or coach must either:</p>

<ul>
<li>meet enhanced environmental standards, approved by the Vehicle Certification Agency</li>
  <li>be fitted with an engine of a higher environmental standard</li>
  <li>be converted to run on gas</li>
</ul>
<p>Any bus or coach that was registered in the UK before October 2009 can take the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Some vehicles that aren’t eligible for an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> can still get an <abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>. Your bus or coach qualifies if it was registered in Great Britain before 1 October 2009 and has been fitted with a full flow particulate filter approved by Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>).</p>

<h2>What happens at the test</h2>

<p>The tests for both the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr> are in 2 parts. There is a physical inspection to check any modifications, like a filter fitted to the exhaust, and then a ‘smoke opacity test’ to check emissions.</p>

<p>If the vehicle passes both parts of one of the tests, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will issue you either an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> or an <abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>. If your vehicle is registered in Great Britain, these details are then automatically passed to <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> so you can use the vehicle in the Low Emission Zone.</p>

<p>If your vehicle is registered outside Great Britain, you need to <a rel="external" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/lez/17702.aspx#tkt-tab-panel-4" title="register your certificate with TfL">register your certificate with <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr></a> yourself.</p>
