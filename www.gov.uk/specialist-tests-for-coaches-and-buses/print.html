  </header><p>Commercial vehicles are tested every year to make sure they’re roadworthy and comply with any relevant regulations. This is known as <a href="/annual-test-for-lorries-buses-and-trailers" title="The annual test for lorries, buses and trailers">the annual test</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the annual test, there are extra tests coaches and buses may need to take to:</p>

<ul>
<li>qualify for a lower rate of vehicle tax (commonly known as road tax) by getting a Reduced Pollution Certificate</li>
  <li>qualify for free entrance to the London low emission zone by getting a Reduced Pollution Certificate or Low Emission Certificate</li>
  <li>meet new <a href="/specialist-tests-for-coaches-and-buses/seat-belt-installation-tests" title="seat belt tests">seat belt safety rules</a>

<p>You’ll need to get a <a href="/specialist-tests-for-coaches-and-buses/pre-registration-inspection" title="Pre Registration Inspection">Pre Registration Inspection (<abbr title="Pre Registration Inspection">PRI</abbr>)</a> to register a passenger vehicle for private use that doesn’t need <a href="/vehicle-approval/overview" title="Vehicle approval">approval</a> and has more than 8 passenger seats.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="reduced-pollution-certificate-rpc-and-low-emissions-certificate-lec-tests"><header><h1>Part 2: Reduced Pollution Certificate (RPC) and Low Emissions Certificate (LEC) tests</h1>
  </header><p>If you modify a bus or coach to cut its emissions, you can get it tested by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) for a Reduced Pollution Certificate (<abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>). The certificate reduces the cost of the vehicle excise duty (commonly known as road tax).</p>

<p>Some RPCs also mean you can drive the vehicle in the Low Emission Zone (<abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr>) without charge. The <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> covers most of Greater London and heavy diesel vehicles are charged to enter the area.</p>

<p>Some vehicles that don’t qualify for an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> can still get a Low Emissions Certificate (<abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>) – this means they can be driven in the <abbr title="Low Emission Zone">LEZ</abbr> without charge, but their road tax will stay the same.</p>

<p>You can have the tests done as part of your annual test, or separately. It’s cheaper as part of the annual test.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> test</h2>

<p>To get an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>, a bus or coach must either:</p>

<ul>
<li>meet enhanced environmental standards, approved by the Vehicle Certification Agency</li>
  <li>be fitted with an engine of a higher environmental standard</li>
  <li>be converted to run on gas</li>
</ul>
<p>Any bus or coach that was registered in the UK before October 2009 can take the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Some vehicles that aren’t eligible for an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> can still get an <abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>. Your bus or coach qualifies if it was registered in Great Britain before 1 October 2006 and has been fitted with a full flow particulate filter approved by Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>).</p>

<h2>What happens at the test</h2>

<p>The tests for both the <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr> are in 2 parts. There is a physical inspection to check any modifications, like a filter fitted to the exhaust, and then a ‘smoke opacity test’ to check emissions.</p>

<p>If the vehicle passes both parts of one of the tests, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will issue you with either an <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> or an <abbr title="Lower Emissions Certificate">LEC</abbr>. If your vehicle is registered in Great Britain, these details are then automatically passed to <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> so you can use the vehicle in the Low Emission Zone.</p>

<p>If your vehicle is registered outside Great Britain, you need to <a rel="external" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/lez/17702.aspx#tkt-tab-panel-4" title="register your certificate with TfL">register your certificate with <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr></a> yourself.</p>

</article><article id="seat-belt-installation-tests"><header><h1>Part 6: Seat belt installation tests</h1>
  </header><p>Manufacturers of some buses, coaches and minibuses must make sure their seat belts meet new safety rules.</p>

<h2>Vehicles that need to be tested</h2>

<p>If your vehicle has additional seat belts fitted beyond those required by law, it must be tested if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s a private passenger vehicle with more than 8 passenger seats and was first used on or after 1 October 2001</li>
  <li>it’s a public service vehicle</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>Private passenger vehicles registered before 1 October 2001.</p>

<p>Buses made to carry standing passengers are also exempt, but if they have seat belts these must be tested.</p>

<p>Public service vehicles that need a <a href="/vehicle-approval/certificate-of-initial-fitness" title="Certificate Of Initial Fitness">Certificate of Initial Fitness (<abbr title="Certificate of Initial Fitness">COIF</abbr>)</a> have their seat belts checked as part of this process.</p>

<h2>Arrange a test</h2>

<p>You can get your passenger vehicle’s seat belt installation tested at one of the following centres:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.status.org.uk/testing.html" title="Testing">Status</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.millbrook.co.uk/Page/Seat-and-Seat-Belt-Anchorage" title="Seat &amp; seat belt anchorage tests">Millbrook proving ground</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.trl.co.uk/facilities/impact_testing/" title="Impact testing">Transport research laboratory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As long as they’ve the right equipment and staff to do this, manufacturers can test their own seat belts.</p>

<p>Testing seat belts is usually part of obtaining a <a href="/vehicle-approval/certificate-of-initial-fitness" title="Certificate Of Initial Fitness"><abbr title="Certificate of Initial Fitness">COIF</abbr></a> on new vehicles.</p>

<p>You can get more advice about testing your passenger vehicle’s seat belts from the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>).</p>
