  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="public-rights-of-way"><header><h1>Part 1: Public rights of way</h1>
  </header><p>Public rights of way are open to everyone. They can be roads, paths or tracks, and can run through towns, countryside or private property.</p>

<p>You have the right to walk along them. Some rights of way are also open to horse riders, cyclists or motorists:</p>

<ul>
<li>footpaths - let you go by foot only</li>
  <li>bridleways - let you go by foot, horse or bike</li>
  <li>restricted byways - let you travel by any form of transport that doesn’t have a motor</li>
  <li>byways open to all traffic - let you travel by any form of transport, including cars (though they’re mainly used by walkers and horse riders)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rights of way in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</h2>
<p>You can find rights of way:</p>

<ul>
<li>on Ordnance Survey (<abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr>) maps</li>
  <li>in guide books </li>
  <li>on <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council websites</a>
</li>
  <li>while walking – rights of way are often marked with coloured arrows</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems in using a right of way</h3>
<p>The people who own or maintain the land must keep public rights of way open and useable. </p>

<p>If you have a problem using a right of way - eg an obstruction, poor maintenance or a misleading sign – you should report it to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/contactus" title="National Parks contact details">National Park Authority</a> if it’s in a national park</li>
  <li>the local highway authority – you can contact them through <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">your local council</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/contacts" title="Forestry Commission">Forestry Commission</a> in woodland</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing a public right of way</h3>
<p>Local councils can:</p>

<ul>
<li>make new routes - where they think there’s a need</li>
  <li>get rid of a route - if it can be shown that there’s no longer a need for it, or to prevent crime (eg if it is allowing robbery or drug dealing to take place)</li>
  <li>change the route temporarily or permanently - but only if the new route is just as convenient</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply to <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">your council</a> if you think a public right of way should be changed or removed.</p>

<p>If you don’t agree with a decision, you can appeal to the Secretary of State.</p>

<h2>Rights of way in Scotland</h2>
<p>In Scotland, a right of way:</p>

<ul>
<li>is any route that people have been able to walk on for at least 20 years </li>
  <li>must link 2 public places, eg a village, church or road</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding rights of way in Scotland</h3>
<p>Scottish local authorities don’t have to signpost or mark a right of way. The charity <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotways.com/" title="Scotways">Scotways</a> helps record and sign routes.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/" title="Outdoor Access Code">Scottish Outdoor Access Code</a> gives guidance on how to behave responsibly in the Scottish countryside.</p>


</article><article id="land-with-no-right-of-way"><header><h1>Part 2: Land with no right of way</h1>
  </header><p>Some landowners may let you access their land for walking, cycling or horse riding. This is known as ‘permissive access’.</p>

<p>Some farms provide educational access to schools, families and other groups for study purposes or general interest. <a rel="external" href="http://cwr.naturalengland.org.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=MenuSub&amp;Module=EducationalSearch" title="Educational access">Natural England’s website</a> has details of these farms, as well as conservation walks and rides.</p>

<p>You can also access some land of outstanding scenic or scientific interest – the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/heritage/lbsearch.htm" title="Land and buildings database">HM Revenue &amp; Customs directory</a> lets you search for these properties.</p>

<p>On Ordnance Survey maps, permissive access is marked with orange broken lines.</p>

<h2>Restrictions on permissive access land</h2>
<p>Some permissive access areas are closed at certain times of the year to protect sensitive sites – eg when rare birds are nesting.</p>

<p>You can usually take your dog on permissive access land, but it must be kept on a short (2m or less) fixed lead at all times. Sometimes, eg during lambing season, dogs may not be allowed.</p>

</article><article id="open-access-land"><header><h1>Part 3: Open access land</h1>
  </header><p>You can access certain land across Britain without having to use paths. This land is known as ‘open access land’ or ‘access land’. Your right to access this land is called the right, or freedom, to roam.</p>

<p>Access land includes mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.openaccess.naturalengland.org.uk/wps/portal/oasys/maps/MapSearch" title="Open access map search">search for open access land on the Natural England website.</a></p>

<h2>What you can and can’t do on access land</h2>
<p>You can use access land for walking, running, watching wildlife and climbing. </p>

<p>There are some activities you can’t usually do on access land, called ‘general restrictions’. They include horse riding, cycling, fishing, camping, taking animals other than dogs onto the land, driving a vehicle and water sports.</p>

<p>However, you can do these things if: </p>

<ul>
<li>the landowner allows it</li>
  <li>there are existing rights or local traditions in place – eg an event that has taken place for many years</li>
  <li>public bridleways or byways cross the land – horse riders and cyclists can ride along these</li>
</ul>
<h2>Excepted land</h2>
<p>Access is not allowed on some land shown on maps as ‘access land’. This is to protect the privacy of people living and working there, or for public safety. This type of land is called ‘excepted land’.</p>

<p>You can still use any footpaths, bridleways, byways or other rights of way through excepted land.</p>

<p>Excepted land includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>land less than 20 metres away from people’s homes</li>
  <li>land that is being used to grow food</li>
  <li>land used for railways or golf courses</li>
</ul>
<p>Landowners can close off their land to the public for up to 28 days a year, or more if they need to for land management, fire prevention or public safety.</p>

</article><article id="landowner-rights-and-responsibilities"><header><h1>Part 4: Landowner rights and responsibilities</h1>
  </header><p>If your land has a public right of way (<abbr title="public right of way">PROW</abbr>) on it, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide and maintain stiles and gates</li>
  <li>cut back overhanging vegetation that may obstruct the <abbr title="public right of way">PROW</abbr>
</li>
  <li>ensure that field-edge paths are left free from cultivation for the legal minimum width of 1.5 metres for a public footpath and 3 metres for a public bridleway</li>
</ul>
<p>You can disturb the surface of a footpath or bridleway across a field in order to plough the land. However, if you do this you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>make good the surface of the path - within 14 days if you’re sowing a crop, or within 24 hours in all other circumstances</li>
  <li>return the surface to at least the minimum width - a cross-field footpath must be at least 1 metre wide, a bridleway must be at least 2 metres wide</li>
  <li>use signs to show the route</li>
</ul>
<h2>Obstructions</h2>
<p>Obstructing a <abbr title="public right of way">PROW</abbr> is a criminal offence. Local councils can tell you to remove an obstruction. If you don’t do it, they can remove the obstruction and charge you for the work.</p>

<h2>Pesticides</h2>
<p>You should only use pesticides approved for use on PROWs, and follow the product instructions carefully.</p>

<h2>Animals</h2>
<p>No dairy bull over 10 months of age may be allowed to roam freely in a field crossed by a <abbr title="public right of way">PROW</abbr>. </p>

<p>Bulls of all other breeds must be accompanied by cows or heifers when in fields which have public access. </p>

<p>Horses may be kept loose in fields crossed by PROWs, as long as they are not known to be dangerous.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can be prosecuted if you keep a potentially dangerous animal on land crossed by a <abbr title="public right of way">PROW</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cross compliance</h2>
<p>If a designated public right of way (<abbr title="public right of way">PROW</abbr>) crosses your land and you claim agricultural payments under the Single Payments Scheme, make sure you’re familiar with <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/814240C66F10CAC8802570C7004248D4?Opendocument" title="Cross compliance">cross compliance</a> rules. These rules apply to all your land - not just the land you claim for.</p>
