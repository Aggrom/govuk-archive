<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a pig farmer, it’s essential that you take the necessary steps to protect the health of your livestock. While maintaining good health is important to ensure acceptable standards of animal welfare, such measures will also maximise the productivity of your herd.</p>

<p>This guide has information about the main notifiable diseases affecting pigs, which must be reported, and general disease prevention advice. It covers legal controls to prevent specific risks, including your responsibilities relating to herd registration, pig feed and drug use.</p>

<p>For specific advice relating to the animal welfare aspects of good herd management, see the related guide on pig welfare.</p>

<h2 id="critical-illnesses-of-pigs">Critical illnesses of pigs</h2>

<p>Looking after your animals properly and monitoring them regularly for signs of illness are the best ways of preventing disease, and of controlling its spread if there is an outbreak.</p>

<p>A notifiable disease is a named disease that must be reported to a government authority. If you suspect signs of a notifiable disease, you must immediately notify the duty vet at your local Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>). </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Pigs are vulnerable to several notifiable diseases including:</p>

<ul>
<li>African swine fever</li>
  <li>anthrax</li>
  <li>Aujeszky’s disease</li>
  <li>classical swine fever</li>
  <li>foot-and-mouth disease</li>
  <li>rabies</li>
  <li>swine vesicular disease</li>
  <li>Teschen disease</li>
  <li>Vesicular stomatitis</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information and a complete list of notifiable diseases for other animal species, see the guides on disease prevention and disease notification and restrictions.</p>

<p>Prompt action at the earliest stages is essential. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=109566&amp;id=109567">Download a guide for new keepers of pigs from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 431KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="disease-prevention-and-control-for-pigs">Disease prevention and control for pigs</h2>

<p>Monitoring your livestock and following good farming practices are the best ways to reduce the risk of disease among your pigs. </p>

<h3 id="buying-registering-identifying-and-moving-pigs">Buying, registering, identifying and moving pigs</h3>

<p>There are rules in place which you must follow for registering pigs, and when moving them. These procedures make it easier to trace and identify infected animals in the event of a disease outbreak. For more information, see the guide on pigs identification, registration and movement.</p>

<p>When restocking your herd, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>consult your vet to help you develop a plan for evaluating prospective purchases</li>
  <li>buy health scheme animals - whenever possible - that have been certified as free of specific diseases</li>
  <li>recognise the risks in buying older animals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="biosecurity-and-hygiene">Biosecurity and hygiene</h3>

<p>Good biosecurity is a vital part of keeping disease away from your animals. This will also protect the health of your workers and any members of the public who may visit your farm.</p>

<p>Your general biosecurity measures should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>restricting and controlling movements of people, vehicles and equipment into areas where your pigs are kept</li>
  <li>cleaning and disinfecting equipment, vehicles, protective clothing and footwear before and after contact with farm animals</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of a disease may not always be apparent - particularly in the early stages - so the measures above need to be part of your routine.</p>

<p>Read more about biosecurity, including special rules for agricultural markets and shows, in the guide on disease prevention.</p>

<h3 id="health-and-welfare-programmes">Health and welfare programmes</h3>

<p>You should seek veterinary and technical advice to create a written health and welfare programme for your pigs. This should be reviewed and updated annually. As a minimum, it should include your:</p>

<ul>
<li>vaccination policy and timing</li>
  <li>parasite control procedures - internal and external</li>
</ul>
<p>Drugs are useful tool for preventing disease in pigs, but you must use these responsibly and record all usage. </p>

<p>You can reduce the risk of disease and improve the performance of your livestock by using farm health planning techniques. <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/fhp/pigs.htm">Find out about farm health planning for pigs on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h3 id="veterinary-surveillance">Veterinary surveillance</h3>

<p>As part of its disease prevention strategy, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> constantly collects information about incidences of disease in animals. This monitoring enables any important or unusual outbreaks to be detected quickly - so that appropriate action can be taken.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/vetsurveillance/info.htm">Read about veterinary surveillance on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-single-payment-scheme-sps-and-farmed-animal-requirements">The Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and farmed animal requirements</h3>

<p>If you receive <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> or other direct payments, you must comply with Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>). <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 6, for example, sets out the requirements for pig identification and registration whereas <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 10-15 are about disease prevention through the feeding and medicinal treatment restrictions set out in this guide.</p>

<p>You can find more information in the guide to the Single Payment Scheme or <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/21C99DDAEB3232A9802573AA004EFA3E?Opendocument">access relevant <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> on the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h2 id="disposal-of-fallen-stock">Disposal of fallen stock</h2>

<p>‘Fallen stock’ is any animal that has died of natural causes or disease on a farm or that has been killed on a farm for reasons other than for human consumption.</p>

<p>You are not permitted to bury or burn fallen stock on farm due to the risk of spreading disease through residues in the soil, groundwater or air pollution. This ban also covers animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>), including afterbirth and stillborn animals.</p>

<p>The only exceptions to this ban are:</p>

<ul>
<li>in remote areas - parts of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, Bardsey Island and Caldy Island in Wales, and the Scilly Isles, and Lundy Island</li>
  <li>during outbreaks of notifiable disease - if there is a lack of capacity at rendering plants and incinerators, or if transporting carcasses would spread disease</li>
</ul>
<p>All fallen farm animals - including stillborn animals - must be collected by an approved transporter and taken for disposal or treatment to an approved:</p>

<ul>
<li>knacker</li>
  <li>hunt kennel</li>
  <li>maggot farm</li>
  <li>incinerator</li>
  <li>renderer</li>
</ul>
<p>Fallen stock must be collected, identified and transported without ‘undue delay’. This means as soon as is reasonably practical under the circumstances (usually within 48hrs of death).</p>

<p><abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> must be transported in covered leak-proof containers/vehicles and be accompanied by a commercial document. For more information, see the guide on dealing with animal by-products.</p>

<h3 id="national-fallen-stock-scheme">National Fallen Stock Scheme</h3>

<p>You can dispose of fallen stock privately at an approved destination, or you can make arrangements through the National Fallen Stock Company (<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>). As a farmer, you can register with the scheme for the collection and disposal of your fallen stock. Members receive a list of the approved collectors operating in their area and the prices that they charge. Members can contact a registered collector of their choice whenever they have fallen stock. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.nfsco.co.uk/">find information on fallen stock on the National Fallen Stock Scheme website.</a></p>

<h3 id="ahvla"><abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr></h3>

<p>If you want to make your own arrangements, your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> will provide a list of approved knackers, hunt kennels, maggot farms, incinerators or renderers.</p>

<p>If you want to burn animal carcasses in your own on-farm incinerator, your incinerator must comply with <abbr title="animal by-product">ABP</abbr> controls and environmental permitting requirements. It must also be approved by the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information on environmental permits for incinerators, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview/overview">burning waste - your environmental responsibilities.</a></p>

<p>You can also find out which <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> can be incinerated in the guide on dealing with animal by-products.</p>

<p>You must also contact your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> immediately if you think an animal has died of a notifiable disease.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://vla.defra.gov.uk/services/ser_bse_lab_approvals.htm#approved">find approved premises for TSE testing on the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Animal carcasses or parts of animal carcasses suspected or confirmed as infected by a TSE are category 1 <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> - the highest risk category. They must be disposed of by incineration, or processing (rendering) followed by incineration. You can find out about destroying TSE-infected carcasses and specified risk material in the guide on keeping livestock healthy - disease controls, prevention, notification and restrictions.</p>

<p>For more information on dealing with disposal and recording, see the guide on fallen stock.</p>

<h2 id="pig-health-and-cross-compliance">Pig health and cross compliance</h2>

<p>Cross compliance requirements apply to you if you receive direct payments under Common Agricultural Policy support schemes or if you receive payments under certain Rural Development schemes. To receive your full subsidy payment you must comply with the <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> and standards of good agricultural and environmental condition requirements that apply to your business.</p>

<p>If you don’t carry out your <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> obligations, you may face enforcement action and even prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="smr-10---restrictions-on-the-use-of-substances-having-hormonal-or-thyrostatic-action-and-beta-agonists">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 10 - Restrictions on the use of substances having hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists</h3>

<p>The aim of these requirements is to prohibit the illegal use in stock farming of substances that have a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists, and to prevent the residues that these substances leave in meat and other foodstuffs from entering the human or animal food chain.</p>

<h2 id="pig-feed">Pig feed</h2>

<p>Feed contaminants such as lead or antimicrobial residues - or biological agents such as botulism - may cause disease in pigs and make their produce unsuitable for human consumption.</p>

<p>You must not give unsafe feed to food-producing animals. See the guide on farmed animal food and feed law.</p>

<p>In addition, you are not permitted to feed pigs any catering waste whatsoever even if it comes from vegetarian restaurants and kitchens, whether processed or not.</p>

<h3 id="animal-by-products-abps-as-foodstuffs">Animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>) as foodstuffs</h3>

<p>You can use some former foodstuffs - food previously intended for human consumption - as livestock feed, subject to the animal by-products regulations.</p>

<p>You must not feed meat, fish and most other products of animal origin to ruminants, pigs or poultry, or allow them access to such material.</p>

<p>For more information about <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> and foodstuffs that can be fed to your livestock, see the guide on dealing with animal by-products. In effect, <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> in this category mean milk and certain milk products that meet specific conditions. If they are unprocessed, they must come from registered premises.</p>

<p>For more information, you can <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264636&amp;id=264637">download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on disposing of former foodstuff <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 68KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="hormonal-treatments-and-antibiotics-for-pigs">Hormonal treatments and antibiotics for pigs</h2>

<p>Due to concerns about the potential risk to humans, the use of hormonal growth promoters for livestock is banned in the UK. Antibiotic growth-promoting feed additives have also been phased out - because of concerns about the potential spread of antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/vetsurveillance/antimicrobial-res.htm">Read about antimicrobial resistance in bacteria associated with animals on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>As a result, if you keep farmed animals there are restrictions on the use of treatments that:</p>

<ul>
<li>act as beta-agonists</li>
  <li>have hormonal actions</li>
  <li>reduce production of thyroid hormones</li>
</ul>
<p>You must prevent meat containing these substances from entering the human - or animal - food chain</p>

<p>Restricted treatments include:</p>

<ul>
<li>phenylbutazone</li>
  <li>tetracyclines</li>
  <li>sulphonamides</li>
  <li>nalidixic acid</li>
  <li>fusidic acid</li>
  <li>florphenicol</li>
  <li>ceftriaxone</li>
</ul>
<p>Restricted antibiotic substances include:</p>

<ul>
<li>chloramphenicol</li>
  <li>ampicillin</li>
  <li>amoxycillin/clavulanate</li>
  <li>neomycin</li>
  <li>gentamicin</li>
  <li>enrofloxacin</li>
  <li>tiamulin</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>give food-producing animals restricted substances - unless in line with permitted exceptions</li>
  <li>use substances containing oestradiol 17ß or its ester-like derivatives</li>
  <li>use substances containing hormones or with thyroid hormone reducing actions - unless prescribed by a vet</li>
  <li>use substances that contain beta-agonists to slow labour in cows when calving</li>
  <li>have food-producing animals on your farm that have been given any restricted substance - unless in line with permitted exceptions</li>
  <li>send animals that have been given any restricted substances to slaughter - unless in line with permitted exceptions</li>
  <li>sell meat or any other animal product that has been given a restricted substance - unless in line with permitted exceptions</li>
</ul>
<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>obey the relevant withdrawal period - ie the period between the end of treatment and the slaughter of the animal - if your food-producing animals are given a restricted substance</li>
  <li>keep veterinary records relating to the medicinal use any restricted substances on your animals</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protecting-pigs-from-lead-exposure-and-poisoning-on-farms">Protecting pigs from lead exposure and poisoning on farms</h2>

<p>Accumulation of lead beyond legal limits in animals can make their meat unsafe and illegal to enter the food chain. Lead poisoning can also result in stunted animal growth, increased birth defects and infertility, decreased productivity, loss of market value, disposal costs for dead animals and vet fees.</p>

<h3 id="causes-of-lead-poisoning-on-farms">Causes of lead poisoning on farms</h3>

<p>Pigs are relatively tolerant to lead compared to other species. However, they are more likely to accumulate lead in their meat and offals with no outward signs of lead poisoning. The most frequently recorded cause of lead exposure in pigs has been high lead soils. Free range pigs ingest soil whilst rooting.</p>

<p>High lead soils usually arise from historic mining and melting operations or land erosion especially by water courses or occasionally landslips. In some parts of the country high lead soils have been coppiced in the past marking the land as unsuitable for livestock. If you have any doubts it is worth making enquiries about previous land usage.</p>

<p>Other sources of lead which pigs might be exposed to on farms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>flaking high-lead paint</li>
  <li>abandoned and broken lead acid batteries from electric fencing and vehicles</li>
  <li>lead shots</li>
  <li>bonfire ash from burned items containing lead</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-lead-contamination-on-your-farm">How to avoid lead contamination on your farm</h3>

<p>There are several steps you can take to protect your pigs and the human food chain from lead contamination. You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid keeping free range pigs on high lead soils</li>
  <li>make enquiries about previous land usage and seek advice if you have any doubts about whether land is suitable</li>
</ul>
<p>If you suspect some of your pigs are contaminated with lead, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>remove them from the affected area immediately</li>
  <li>consult your vet</li>
  <li>confirm the cause of disease and if it is lead poisoning investigate the source</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="testing-for-lead-in-pigs">Testing for lead in pigs</h3>

<p>Advice and testing for lead in your livestock, produce or soil is available via your vet and from your regional Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Veterinary Laboratories Agency">VLA</abbr>), you can call the Laboratory Services Department on Tel 01932 357 335.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/vla/vla/vla_map.htm">find contact details for your regional <abbr title="Veterinary Laboratories Agency">VLA</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="pig-inspections-and-record-keeping">Pig inspections and record keeping</h2>

<p>In taking responsibility for your herd, you must have the skills needed to safeguard the animals’ health and welfare. This includes being familiar with the welfare code for that species. For stock management advice relating to welfare, see the guide on pig welfare.</p>

<p>Regular inspection of your herd is essential to maintain good health. You should be familiar with the normal behaviour of pigs and be alert for any signs of illness or distress - calling in expert veterinary assistance where necessary.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring-pigs">Monitoring pigs</h3>

<p>Signs of ill health include:</p>

<ul>
<li>separation from the group</li>
  <li>listlessness</li>
  <li>swollen navel, udder or joints</li>
  <li>rapid or irregular breathing</li>
  <li>persistent coughing or panting</li>
  <li>shivering</li>
  <li>discolouration or blistering of the skin</li>
  <li>loss of body condition</li>
  <li>sneezing</li>
  <li>lameness</li>
  <li>lack of co-ordination</li>
  <li>constipation or diarrhoea</li>
  <li>poor appetite</li>
  <li>vomiting</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of your inspection routine, you should also consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Body condition scoring - to assess the body fat of individual animals. It is particularly helpful for checking sows in the different stages of the breeding cycle.</li>
  <li>Lameness checking - inspection of the feet and legs is particularly important in pigs. Lameness is a sign of ill health and discomfort, and perhaps of disease or poor welfare. You should consult a vet if a lame animal does not respond to routine treatment. The animal may need to be culled if it does not respond to veterinary treatment in order to prevent further suffering. There are legal restrictions on transporting lame animals.</li>
  <li>Internal and external parasite inspections - parasites can be treated in accordance with veterinary advice and as part of a health and welfare plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="record-keeping">Record-keeping</h3>

<p>You must keep records of treatment given to animals, and of animal mortality, for at least three years. Stock keepers must also keep full records of all medicines used, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>where the medicines were bought</li>
  <li>the date the animals were treated</li>
  <li>the type and quantity of medicine used</li>
  <li>which animals were treated</li>
</ul>
<p>You may only use authorised veterinary medicinal products, and you must record the name and address of the supplier. Although not required, it is also useful to record specific cases and treatment of disorders. For more information, see the guide on managing livestock veterinary medicines.</p>
