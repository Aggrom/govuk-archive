Your contributions will increase in value by the time you retire and you don't pay tax on the money that goes into it.\r\n\r\n###Automatic enrolment\r\n\r\nIf you're not a member of a scheme and you haven't specifically chosen not to join one, you may get [automatically enrolled](/auto-enrolment-workplace-company-pension \"Automatic enrolment into a pension at work\") into a scheme.\r\n\r\n##Make extra workplace pension contributions\r\n\r\nYou can pay extra into your workplace pension scheme, if you're a member of one. Contact the pension scheme to find out how, or ask your employer.\r\n\r\n##Make extra National Insurance contributions\r\n\r\nIf you want to increase the amount of State Pension you'll get, you can make extra [voluntary National Insurance contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions \"Voluntary National Insurance contributions\").\r\n\r\n##Find a lost pension\r\n\r\nIf you have any old pensions and you think the company might not be able to contact you, you can [find a lost pension](/find-lost-pension \"Find a lost pension\").\r\n\r\n##Work longer\r\n\r\nYou [don't have to retire](/retirement-age \"Retirement age\") at a particular age, unless there's a good reason that the employer can justify.\r\n\r\n##Defer your State Pension\r\n\r\nYou can choose not to claim your State Pension when you reach State Pension age but take it later ('[deferring your State Pension](/deferring-state-pension \"Deferring your State Pension\")'). This means you'll either get a lump sum or an increased weekly amount when you do claim it.\r\n\r\n##Pay into a personal pension\r\n\r\nThis is a voluntary scheme you pay into to save for retirement, but it also allows you to pay less tax. They're often used by self-employed people instead of a workplace pension.\r\n\r\nFor help and advice with personal pensions, contact the [Pensions Advisory Service.](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/ \"Pensions Advisory Service\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n##Other ways to save\r\n\r\nThere are also other ways to save including savings accounts and Individual Savings Accounts ('ISAs'). \r\n\r\nYou can read about [ways to save and invest](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/categories/saving-and-investing \"Saving and investing\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the Money Advice Service website.\r\n\r\n*[ISAs]: Individual Savings Accounts","slug":"increase-your-retirement-income","title":"Increase your retirement income"}},{"table":{"body":"##Basic State Pension\r\n\r\nIf you pay [National Insurance](/national-insurance \"National Insurance\") you'll build up entitlement to the [basic State Pension](/state-pension \"State Pension\").
