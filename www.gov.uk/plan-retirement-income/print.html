  </header><p>A pension is a way to save money and will give you an income later in your life. </p>

<p>You can get a pension from schemes you pay into and from the government. </p>

<h2>Check what you need to live on in retirement</h2>

<p>You may need more to live on when you retire than the State Pension alone. </p>

<p>If you’re single, haven’t got any other pensions and you retire tomorrow, a full State Pension would give you £107.45 per week. </p>

</div>

<h2>How much a pension could be worth</h2>

<p>Use the Money Advice Service’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/pension-calculator" title="Money Advice Service pension calculator">pension calculator.</a></p>

<p>It shows you:</p>

<ul>
<li>what you can expect to get from a pension, whatever age you start paying into one</li>
  <li>what would happen to the value of your pension if you delay for 1, 2 or 5 years</li>
</ul></article><article id="your-pension-options"><header><h1>Part 2: Your pension options</h1>
  </header><p>You can pay into as many pension schemes as you want. It depends on how much money you can set aside.</p>

<p>When you pay into a pension scheme the government will automatically add <a href="/income-tax-reliefs/pension-contributions-tax-relief" title="pension contributions tax relief">tax relief</a> - as long as you don’t pay in within a tax year more than the higher of:</p>

<ul>
<li>your total annual income</li>
  <li>£50,000</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pay in more than that, you’ll usually have to pay tax on the additional amount you pay in.</p>

<p>For most workplace and personal pensions, how much you get depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount you’ve paid in </li>
  <li>how well the pension fund’s investments have done </li>
  <li>your age - and sometimes your health - when you start getting the pension</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workplace pensions</h2>

<p>If your employer offers a <a href="/workplace-pensions" title="Workplace pensions">workplace pension</a>, they can make contributions on top of what you pay. Many employers do.</p>

<p>You may also be able to make extra payments to boost the pension. </p>

<p>Workplace pensions are <a href="/workplace-pensions/protection-for-your-pension" title="Protection for your pension">protected against risks.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The government is bringing in changes to the law on workplace pensions. By 2018, your employer must <a href="/auto-enrolled-into-workplace-pension" title="Workplace pensions - automatic enrolment">automatically enrol</a> you in a scheme if you’re over 22 and under State Pension age and earn more than £8,105 a year.</p>
</div>

<h2>Personal and stakeholder pensions</h2>

<p>These are private pensions. Stakeholder pensions must meet certain standards set by the government. </p>

<p>Some employers may offer you these pensions as a workplace pension.</p>

<p>You might want to get a <a href="/personal-pensions-your-rights" title="personal and stakeholder pensions">personal or stakeholder pension</a> to save extra money for retirement to top up your workplace pension. </p>

<p>Self-employed people without a workplace pension scheme might want to pay into a personal or stakeholder pension.</p>

<p>If you’re not working but can afford to pay into a pension scheme, this type might also be an option for you. </p>

<h2>Find a lost pension</h2>

<p>If you lose track of which pensions you paid into you, the Pension Tracing Service might be able to <a href="/find-lost-pension" title="find a lost pension">trace it for you</a>.</p>

</article><article id="pensions-from-the-government"><header><h1>Part 4: Pensions from the government</h1>
  </header><h2>The Basic State Pension</h2>

<p>You get the full <a href="/state-pension" title="basic State Pension">basic State Pension</a> if you’ve paid or been credited with at least 30 years’ worth of <a href="/national-insurance" title="National Insurance">National Insurance contributions</a> or <a href="/boost-state-pension" title="National Insurance Credits">National Insurance credits</a> before you reach State Penson age.</p>

<p>The full basic State Pension is currently £107.45 a week.</p>

<p>If you don’t have 30 years when you’re approaching <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension age">State Pension age</a>, you can pay <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions" title="voluntary National insurance contributions">voluntary contributions</a> to make sure you’re getting the full amount. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension calculator">State Pension calculator</a> to find out how much State Pension you could get now.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Additional State Pension</h2>
<p>This is an extra amount you may get on top of your Basic State Pension. It’s also based on the amount of National Insurance contributions you’ve paid or had credited.</p>

<p>You can choose to contract out of the Additional State Pension if your employer offers a ‘contracted out’ workplace pension scheme. Ask your employer if this applies to you.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re self employed, you can’t get the Additional State Pension.</p>
</div>

<h2>Getting more State Pension</h2>
<p>When you reach <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension age">State Pension age</a> you have the option to <a href="/deferring-state-pension" title="deferring the State Pension">defer your State Pension</a> (delay payments). By doing this you might get up to £581 extra for every year you defer.</p>

<h2>On a low income</h2>
<p><a href="/pension-credit" title="Pension Credit">Pension Credit</a> is for older people on a low income to make sure they get a minimum weekly amount. You’ll have to apply and all your sources of income (eg savings) will be checked to make sure you qualify. </p>

<p>Getting Pension Credit may mean you’re eligible for other benefits too.</p>

<h2>You’re over 80</h2>
<p>People over 80 with little or no State Pension can apply for a payment of £64.40 per week from the government through the <a href="/over-80-pension" title="Over 80 Pension">Over 80 Pension</a>.</p>

</article><article id="working-past-state-pension-age"><header><h1>Part 5: Working past State Pension age</h1>
  </header><p>You might decide that you don’t want to stop working when you reach State Pension age.</p>

<p>If you do, you <a href="/tax-national-insurance-after-state-pension-age" title="pay less tax">pay less tax</a> when you keep working past your State Pension age.</p>

<p>The law protects you against discrimination if you’re over State Pension age and want to stay in your job or get a new one. </p>

<h2>Staying in your job</h2>
<p>There is no official retirement age and you usually have the right to work as long as you want to. </p>

<p>There are, however, some circumstances when employers may have the right to set a <a href="/retirement-age" title="retirement age">compulsory retirement age that they choose.</a></p>

<p>Your employer can’t make you redundant because of your age. </p>

<h2>Getting a new job</h2>
<p>When applying for a new job you don’t have to give your date of birth if you don’t want to and employers can’t ask you to give this information. </p>

<p>Employers also can’t set an age limit for a job, unless they can justify it (eg because of certain physical abilities) or it’s a limit set by law (eg for the fire service).</p>
