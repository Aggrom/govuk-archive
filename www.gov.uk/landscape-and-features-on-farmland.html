<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Our landscapes are an important part of our cultural heritage and must be planned, designed and managed sympathetically. Landscapes and features in the UK are protected by a range of different measures - including Cross Compliance requirements, planning policies and laws.</p>

<p>Natural England is the statutory adviser for landscapes with specific responsibilities for protecting national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and heritage coasts. It encourages protection of some of our best loved areas of outstanding landscape through participation in agri-environment schemes. The Forestry Commission and English Heritage also have responsibilities for certain aspects of landscapes and their features.</p>

<h2 id="landscape-features-and-cross-compliance">Landscape features and Cross Compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and other direct payments - eg the Environmental Stewardship schemes - you must meet all relevant cross-compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAECs)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on SMRs and GAECs, see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">Cross Compliance: the basics</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-management-requirements">Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMR</abbr>)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/standards-of-good-agricultural-and-environmental-condition">standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hedgerows">Hedgerows</h2>

<p>Hedgerows are a priority habitat for conservation action through the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for rare and declining species. They are recognised as a priority habitat and refuge for many farmland wildlife species. It is against the law to remove or destroy certain hedgerows without prior permission from your local planning authority.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/land-manage/landscape-features/hedgerows/">find the details on hedgerow legislation, management and preservation on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website</a>.</p>

<p>Healthy hedgerows can provide significant benefits for your farm management. They can:</p>

<ul>
<li>help prevent soil erosion, pollution</li>
  <li>help reduce water run-off and flooding</li>
  <li>provide shelter, control livestock and protect crops from the wind</li>
  <li>provide an important habitat for wildlife</li>
</ul>
<p>Poor management, including excessive cutting/trimming can damage a hedgerow, so cutting is recommended on a two- to three-year cycle. Careful management can keep a hedge healthy and in good condition for many years. It can extend the period between management events such as laying or coppicing.</p>

<h3 id="hedge-trimming">Hedge trimming</h3>

<p>You should follow these basic principles for habitat-friendly hedge trimming:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trim in January or February so as to protect birds’ nests. You must avoid trimming hedgerows between 1 March and 31 July - the main nesting season for birds. This will also allow development of berries for winter bird food. This is also a requirement under Cross Compliance.</li>
  <li>Trim on a two or three-year rotation and avoid trimming all hedges in the same year so that thick nesting cover is available somewhere on the farm every year. In addition to saving time and money you will also be boosting the berry crop and populations of overwintering insects.</li>
  <li>If soil or crop conditions mean that you need to carry out an autumn trimming regime then it is even more important that you trim on a two- or three-year rotation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hedgerows-legislation">Hedgerows legislation</h3>

<p>The Hedgerows Regulations 1997 provides protection for most countryside hedgerows by prohibiting their destruction or removal without permission from the local planning authority. You will need to obtain permission before removing hedges that are deemed to be ‘important’ and which meet criteria set out in the regulations. These criteria include hedges that are:</p>

<ul>
<li>over 30 years old</li>
  <li>20 metres or more in length</li>
  <li>contain certain plant species</li>
</ul>
<p>Over 70 per cent of countryside hedgerows in the UK meet these criteria and are deemed to be ‘important’.</p>

<p>You can find a summary of the law regarding hedgerows in the leaflets ‘The Hedgerow Regulations: Your Questions Answered’ and ‘The Hedgerows Regulations 1997: A Guide to the Law and Good Practice’. You can obtain both leaflets free of charge by emailing Defra at <a href="mailto:farmland.conservation@defra.gsi.gov.uk">farmland.conservation@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Hedgerows in areas covered by a Historic Landscape Character statement are often protected on the basis of historical importance and their value for wildlife.</p>

<p>If you claim payments under the Single Payment Scheme or certain Rural Development schemes and have hedgerows on or adjoining your land as part of Cross Compliance requirements - you must meet the standards of good agricultural and environmental condition (GAECs) 14 and 15 for protecting hedgerows.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/CC81AD645B12CE67802573B000506186?Opendocument">find a full list of GAECs on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="funding">Funding</h3>

<p>Funding for a number of hedgerow management options is available to farmers and land managers through Environmental Stewardship including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entry Level Stewardship - includes simple management options for hedgerow maintenance or enhanced hedgerow management. It also includes payments to move away from annual trimming and provide a winter food source for birds and mammals.</li>
  <li>Uplands Entry Level Stewardship - this recently introduced strand of Environmental Stewardship includes options for stone-faced hedgebank management/restoration and hedgerow restoration.</li>
  <li>Higher Level Stewardship - options include payments for Maintenance of Hedgerows of Very High Environmental value (HB 12/13) and capital item payments for new planting, laying and coppicing. It also allows hedgerow management to be tailored to meet specific requirements for target farmland birds and other species or to strengthen local historic landscape character.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more advice on how to qualify for Environmental Stewardship see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-stewardship">Environmental Stewardship: the basics</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/entry-level-stewardship">Entry Level Stewardship (ELS)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/higher-level-stewardship-operation-and-aims">Higher Level Stewardship (HLS)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tree-felling-and-tree-preservation-orders">Tree felling and Tree Preservation Orders</h3>

<p>It is an offence to fell trees without a felling licence from the Forestry Commission unless an exemption applies. You can read more on the page on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1083572899&amp;r.l1=1081597476&amp;r.l2=1082184851&amp;r.l3=1083731980&amp;r.l4=1083830171&amp;type=RESOURCES">tree felling legislation</a> in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trees-and-woodland-management-and-conservation">trees and woodland</a>.</p>

<p>TPOs are issued by Local Planning Authorities (<abbr title="Local Planning Authorities">LPAs</abbr>) which have discretionary powers under section 198 of the Town &amp; Country Planning Act 1990 and the Town &amp; Country Planning (Trees) Regulations 1999 to protect selected trees or woodland for public amenity and enjoyment. A <abbr title="Tree Preservation Order">TPO</abbr> prohibits cutting down, uprooting, topping, lopping, wilful destruction or damage of trees subject to the order without <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> consent.</p>

<p>TPOs can apply to individual or groups of trees, woodland, or cover all trees in a defined area and can apply to hedgerow trees but not to hedgerows themselves. They tend to be most used in urban or semi-urban settings but can apply on farmland or parkland.</p>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> standards 16 and 17 aim to protect trees as they are important habitats and features of our landscape. <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 16 relates to felling of trees and <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 17 relates to TPOs. You must meet these standards if you claim payments under the Common Agricultural Policy such as the Single Payment Scheme or are signed up to agreements under Rural Development such as Environmental Stewardship.</p>

<h2 id="dry-stone-walls">Dry stone walls</h2>

<p>Stone walls of all types are important as landscape and historic features and for stock management. There are four main issues to consider if you have dry stone walls on your land:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintenance</li>
  <li>legal issues</li>
  <li>good practice</li>
  <li>funding</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

<p>Dry stone walls are made without the use of mortar or cement so any damage to walls should be repaired as soon as it happens. You should check the condition of walls at least once a year and any vegetation found should be removed. This ‘airs’ the wall and helps to prevent frost damage.</p>

<p>You should also take care that ivy does not destabilise the wall and if found should be removed as soon as possible to avoid weakening the wall.</p>

<p>Uncultivated strips of land running alongside walls are important habitats for wildlife and act as ‘wildlife corridors’.</p>

<h3 id="legal-issues">Legal issues</h3>

<p>Unlike hedgerows there is no general legal protection for dry stone walls. However, some walls may fall under the jurisdiction of other legislation due to their location. For example, the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 may apply to hedgerows on hedge banks - hedges growing on a stone-faced or earth bank, a particular feature in some areas such as Dartmoor and Exmoor.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>If you receive payments under the Single Payment Scheme and certain rural development schemes you are required to keep stone walls in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr>) as part of Cross Compliance requirements. Particular attention should be paid to <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 13, which prohibits the removal of stone walls from farmland. In addition, stones must not be removed from walls, except under strict circumstances.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/vContentByTaxonomy/RPA%20SchemesSingle%20Payment%20SchemeCross%20ComplianceFarmer%20GuidanceGuide%20to%20Cross%20Compliance%20in%20EnglandGAECsGAEC%2013**?OpenDocument">find guidelines on <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 13 concerning stone walls on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="funding-1">Funding</h3>

<p>Funding is available to farmers and land managers whose land is in Environmental Stewardship for dry stone wall management:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entry Level Stewardship option EB11 encourages dry stone wall protection and maintenance for complete walls or complete sections of walls</li>
  <li>Uplands Entry Level Stewardship has options for stone wall protection and maintenance above the Moorland Line (UB11) and  stone wall restoration (UB17)</li>
  <li>in Higher Level Stewardship capital payments are available for stone wall repair and restoration options</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guides on this site on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/entry-level-stewardship">Entry Level Stewardship (ELS)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/higher-level-stewardship-operation-and-aims">Higher Level Stewardship (HLS)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="scheduled-monuments">Scheduled monuments</h2>

<p>Scheduling refers to the legal system for protecting nationally important archaeological sites in England. Its aim is to preserve significant examples of the archaeological resource for the educational and cultural benefit of future generations.</p>

<p>Not all scheduled monuments are old or above ground - they might be archaeological sites from the prehistoric era, such as burial mounds, or 20th-century remains from the coal industry, World War II or the Cold War.</p>

<p>If you own or occupy a scheduled monument you will need to be aware of the issues and implications. For example, if you wish to carry out works to the scheduled monument, both above and below ground level, you will need to apply to your regional English Heritage office for their written consent. This is known as ‘scheduled monument consent’ (SMC). You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/contact-us/offices/head">find contact details for English Heritage regional offices on the English Heritage website</a>.</p>

<p>There may also be grants available to help maintain or repair scheduled monuments. <a rel="external" href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/professional/funding/grants/grants-available/hbmdl/">Find information on grants for historic buildings, monuments and designed landscapes on the English Heritage website</a>.</p>

<p>‘Works’ are defined by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 (as amended) as demolishing, destroying, damaging, removing, repairing, altering, adding to, flooding or tipping material onto the monument. To avoid damaging a monument you are strongly advised to consult English Heritage while in the planning stages of any intended works.</p>

<p>Certain development works to your property may also require planning permission from your local authority. Obtaining such permission does not remove the need for scheduled monument consent.</p>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 7 relates to scheduled monuments. You must meet the requirements of this standard if you claim payments under the Common Agricultural Policy such as the Single Payment Scheme or are signed up to agreements under Rural Development such as Environmental Stewardship. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/vContentByTaxonomy/RPA%20SchemesSingle%20Payment%20SchemeCross%20ComplianceFarmer%20GuidanceGuide%20to%20Cross%20Compliance%20in%20EnglandGAECsGAEC%207**?OpenDocument">find guidelines on <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 7 concerning scheduled monuments on the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="class-consents">Class consents</h3>

<p>Certain existing or seasonal operations don’t require an application because permission is granted automatically. These are known as ‘class consents’. Most common class consent permits are for agriculture or domestic gardening. You must carefully check that your planned work fully matches the conditions and restrictions of the class consent.</p>

<h2 id="farm-woodland-funding-schemes">Farm woodland funding schemes</h2>

<p>Woodland that was eligible for the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) in 2008 keeps its eligibility for <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments even after trees have been planted on it. Since that change, in support of woodland creation, all new Forestry Commission English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) contracts with Farm Woodland Payments are <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> compatible and landowners can continue claiming <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> as well as Farm Woodland Payments on land in their EWGS after planting woodland.</p>

<p><abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> eligible woodland must be kept in accordance with Cross Compliance rules.</p>

<p>In order to meet Cross Compliance standards you must keep your land in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr>), as well as meeting certain SMRs. For more information on SMRs and <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr>, see information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">Cross Compliance: the basics</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-management-requirements">Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMR</abbr>)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/standards-of-good-agricultural-and-environmental-condition">standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-stewardship">Environmental Stewardship</h3>

<p>Payments for woodland options are available in Environmental Stewardship:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) options include maintenance of stock-proof woodland boundaries to prevent environmental damage, and woodland edge management</li>
  <li>Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) can fund woodland creation, restoration and maintenance. HLS options also include the creation, restoration and maintenance of wood pasture, scrub and orchards</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="woodland-grants">Woodland grants</h3>

<p>There are several woodland grants available under the Forestry Commission’s EWGS, including the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Woodland Planning Grant - for the preparation of plans that assist woodland management</li>
  <li>Woodland Assessment Grant - for the gathering of information to improve management decisions</li>
  <li>Woodland Regeneration Grant - for improving woodland through natural regeneration and restocking after felling</li>
  <li>Woodland Improvement Grant - for woodland work to create, enhance and sustain public benefits</li>
  <li>Woodland Management Grant - for the cost of providing and sustaining better public benefits from existing woodlands</li>
  <li>Woodland Creation Grant - for the creation of new woodlands to deliver benefits to the public - note that the deadline for woodland creation grant applications is 30 September 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>EWGS applicants and the land must be registered on the Customer Register and the Rural Land Register respectively. EWGS is one of the Rural Development Programme for England (<abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr>) schemes.</p>

<p>Natural England runs several schemes for farmers and landowners on behalf of Defra, including Environmental Stewardship. This is an agri-environment scheme that supplies funding to farmers and other land managers in England who deliver effective environmental management on their land. It consists of several strands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) - simple and effective land management that goes beyond the Single Payment Scheme requirement to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition.</li>
  <li>Organic Entry Level Stewardship (OELS) - for land registered with a recognised organic body. Similar to ELS but offering higher payments to reflect the extra commitment and work required.</li>
  <li>Uplands ELS  (UELS) - for land in Severely Disadvantaged Areas (SDAs). Similar to ELS but offering higher payments to reflect the difficulties associated with upland farming.</li>
  <li>Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) - involves complex land management in targeted areas and which receives additional support and advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/30034?category=45001">access the ELS Handbook (which includes  Uplands ELS) on the Natural England website</a>.</p>
