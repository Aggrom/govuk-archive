A caution is not a criminal conviction but it may be told to an employer or used as evidence of bad character if you go to court in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The police will keep a record of photographs, fingerprints and any evidence they collect about your case. If you&rsquo;re cautioned for a sexual offence, you could be placed on the sex offenders register.</p>\n\n<p>You have to agree to be cautioned. If you don&rsquo;t agree, you can be arrested and charged with a crime.</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 types of caution: simple and conditional.</p>\n\n<h3>Simple cautions</h3>\n\n<p>You can be given a simple caution if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you&rsquo;re 18 years or older</li>\n  <li>you admit that you committed the crime</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Simple cautions are &lsquo;spent&rsquo; immediately. This means it does not go on your <a href=\"/how-long-criminal-records-last\" title=\"How long criminal records last\">criminal record</a> and if you&rsquo;re asked on an application form if you have a caution you can reply &lsquo;no&rsquo;. However, the fact you have been cautioned can still be told to an employer or used as evidence of bad character if you have to go to court in the future.</p>\n\n<h3>Conditional cautions</h3>\n\n<p>A conditional caution means that you have to stick to certain rules and restrictions as part of your caution. You can be offered a conditional caution if you&rsquo;re 18 or over, but in some areas youth conditional cautions are also offered to 16 to 17 year-olds.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of conditions include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>rehabilitation - eg treatment for drug misuse, gambling, alcohol or personal problems</li>\n  <li>reparation - eg apologising to the victim or repairing damaged property</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t follow the conditions of your caution, you can be charged with a crime and your case might go to court.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Conditional cautions won\u2019t appear on your <a href=\"/how-long-criminal-records-last\" title=\"How long criminal records last\">criminal record</a> after 3 months.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you are asked on an application if you have received a caution and it is 3 months or more after you have received your conditional caution, you can answer &lsquo;no&rsquo;. If it is less than 3 months, you have to answer &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<h3>Cautions for under 18s</h3>\n\n<p>Young people aged 10 to 17 can get cautions but they are called &lsquo;reprimands&rsquo; or &lsquo;warnings&rsquo; and they are slightly different from adult cautions. </p>\n\n<p>A reprimand is given for a first, minor offence that you admit to. For a second offence, you&rsquo;ll be given a final warning, or charged with a crime if it is a serious offence.</p>\n\n<h2>Penalty notices</h2>\n\n<p>Penalty notices are used for offences that would usually get a fine in court, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>theft from a shop</li>\n  <li>cannabis possession</li>\n  <li>being drunk and disorderly in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll be asked to sign the penalty notice ticket to show that you&rsquo;ve received it. </p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>The ticket will tell you how to pay the penalty and your rights to ask for a trial if you don\u2019t pay.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you pay the penalty then you cannot get a criminal conviction for the offence listed on the ticket.</p>\n\n<p>A penalty notice doesn&rsquo;t go on your criminal record, but it may be disclosed on a <a href=\"/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check\" title=\"Getting a Criminal Records Bureau check\">Criminal Records Bureau enhanced disclosure check</a>. This will only happen if it\u2019s considered relevant, eg if your applying for a job where you will be working with children or vulnerable people.</p>\n\n"}],["tags",[{"title":"Your rights and the law","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/justice%2Frights.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes being arrested, cautions, discrimination and consumer rights","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=justice%2Frights","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/justice/rights"},"parent":{"title":"Crime, justice and the law","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/justice.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Legal processes, courts and the police","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=justice","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/justice"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[{"title":"Police powers of arrest: your rights","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/police-powers-of-arrest-your-rights.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/police-powers-of-arrest-your-rights","format":"answer","details":{"need_id":"1578","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"What is the age of criminal responsibility?","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/age-of-criminal-responsibility.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/age-of-criminal-responsibility","format":"answer","details":{"need_id":"2011","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"2184","business_proposition":true}}]]],"parts":null}
