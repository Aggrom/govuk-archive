<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Climate change is a global problem. Under the Kyoto Protocol, by 2012 the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases - such as <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> - by 8% below 1990 levels. The UK has agreed to reduce its emissions by 12.5% by 2012.</p>

<p>Emissions trading - such as the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Emissions Trading System (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>) - is a key policy measure being used to help the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (and UK) to meet their emissions reduction targets. The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> can affect businesses from energy-intensive sectors such as the energy industry and certain manufacturers. If your business is covered by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>, you must meet targets by either cutting your business’ emissions or by trading allowances.</p>

<p>Large organisations not covered by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> are covered by another scheme called the Carbon Reduction Commitment (<abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr>) Energy Efficiency Scheme. </p>

<p>The guide explains how the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> works, which businesses are affected and how they can comply.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-emissions-trading">What is emissions trading?</h2>

<p>Emissions trading is the buying and selling of greenhouse gas emission allowances. It allows an organisation to decide how and where they will reduce greenhouse gas emissions - such as <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> - through trading their emissions allowances, so that emissions are reduced at the least cost. The cost of emissions allowances is determined by the carbon market and by the demand/availability of allowances.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-greenhouse-gases">What are the greenhouse gases?</h3>

<p>There are many greenhouse gases. Most are naturally occurring, while others result from manufacturing processes, such as refrigeration. A number of greenhouse gases contribute towards climate change, and six of the main greenhouse gases are covered by the Kyoto Protocol. These are known as the ‘greenhouse gas basket’, and include:</p>

<ul>
<li><abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr></li>
  <li>methane (<abbr title="methane">CH4</abbr>)</li>
  <li>hydrofluorocarbons (<abbr title="hydrofluorocarbons">HFCs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>nitrous oxide (<abbr title="nitrous oxide">N2O</abbr>)</li>
  <li>perfluorocarbons (<abbr title="perfluorocarbons">PFCs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>sulphur hexafluoride (<abbr title="sulphur hexafluoride">SF6</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Different activities emit different gases. For example, burning fossil fuels releases <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>, methane and <abbr title="nitrous oxide">N2O</abbr> into the atmosphere, while producing aluminium releases <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> and perfluorocarbons.</p>

<p>The easiest way to calculate your greenhouse gas emissions is to use your activity data and multiply it by the emission factor. The equation you’ll use looks like this:</p>

<p>Activity data x emission factor (carbon contents of the fuels) = greenhouse gas emissions</p>

<p>Most activity data is easy to obtain, relatively accurate and can be found on your gas, electricity and water bills, invoices and receipts. You should look for numbers followed by specific units of measure:</p>

<ul>
<li>electricity bill - total kilowatt hours (<abbr title="kilowatt hours">kWh</abbr>)</li>
  <li>natural gas bill - total <abbr title="kilowatt hours">kWh</abbr>
</li>
  <li>water bill - total water supplied in cubic metres (<abbr title="cubic metres">m³</abbr>)</li>
  <li>water treatment - total water supplied in <abbr title="cubic metres">m³</abbr>
</li>
  <li>water disposal recycling - tonnes of waste treated by waste type, eg glass, paper, waste gone to the landfill as provided by your waste collection provider</li>
</ul>
<p>For emission-releasing activity in vehicles, you’ll need the amount of fuel used in company vehicles. Look for the litres of fuel purchased as seen on your receipts or invoices.</p>

<p>It is normal practice to measure greenhouse gas emissions over a 12-month period. You might want to match this up to your accounting period for ease in recordkeeping.</p>

<p>The emission factors for the individual fuels can be found in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) guidelines, using their greenhouse gas conversion factors. These emission factors are updated annually.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/110819-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors.pdf">download guidelines on greenhouse gas conversion factors from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 1.67MB)</a>.</p>

<p>To use these, you will need the data you have collected, eg annual gas use from your gas bill. You can then input these annual figures into the appropriate spreadsheets of the conversion factors guidelines. The spreadsheet will automatically calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with this gas use.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting/">Find guidance on calculating your greenhouse gas emissions on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Once calculated, you can use the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> formula to convert inputted data into kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use an online calculator to calculate your greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h3 id="eu-emissions-trading-system">
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Emissions Trading System</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> is a European-wide emissions cap and trade system. The cap is the limit on the total emissions allowed from all installations covered by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Each year, operators of sites covered by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> must monitor and report their <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions and surrender enough allowances to meet their target. They can do this by cutting their <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions and trading allowances. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> helps to ensure that emissions are reduced at the lowest cost by enabling participants to trade allowances. For example, organisations with lower emission reduction costs can reduce these further than they need to and sell allowances to organisations that have higher emission reduction costs.</p>

<h3 id="crc-energy-efficiency-scheme">
<abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> Energy Efficiency Scheme</h3>

<p>The mandatory <abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> Energy Efficiency Scheme began in April 2010. The scheme uses an emissions trading mechanism to target <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions that are not covered by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> or climate change agreements.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> Energy Efficiency Scheme covers large non-energy-intensive organisations within the UK public and private sector. This will account for around 5,000 organisations that are responsible for about 10% of emissions in the UK. The scheme is expected to deliver emissions savings of at least 4 million tonnes of <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> per year and save participants approximately £1 billion per year by 2020.</p>

<p>Participant organisations in the <abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> Energy Efficiency Scheme will have to register and then monitor their annual emissions. They will then have to buy and surrender allowances each year equal to their annual emissions or face financial penalties.</p>

<p>Find out more about the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/126698.aspx"><abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> Energy Efficiency Scheme on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> affects installations in industrial sectors which produce significant quantities of greenhouse gases, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>power stations</li>
  <li>refineries</li>
  <li>offshore - eg oil refineries</li>
  <li>iron and steel production</li>
  <li>cement and lime manufacturing</li>
  <li>paper manufacturing</li>
  <li>food and drink processing</li>
  <li>glass production</li>
  <li>ceramics production</li>
  <li>engineering</li>
  <li>vehicle manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p>Other organisations may also be covered by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>, including universities and hospitals.</p>

<p>You can also email the Environment Agency <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> helpdesk at <a href="mailto:ethelp@environment-agency.gov.uk">ethelp@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="businesses-affected-in-the-future">Businesses affected in the future</h3>

<p>From 2012, aviation will also be included in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>. For existing aircraft operators there is a requirement to monitor and report emissions from 1 January 2010. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/140761.aspx">Find <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> information for the aviation sector on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>From 2013, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> will be expanded to cover a number of other industry sectors including:</p>

<ul>
<li>production of bulk organic chemicals</li>
  <li>production of hydrogen</li>
  <li>production of ammonia</li>
  <li>production of aluminium</li>
  <li>production of nitric, adipic and glyoxylic acid</li>
  <li>capture, transport and geological storage of carbon dioxide emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> will also be extended to include other greenhouse gases - such as perfluorocarbons and nitrous oxide - for some industry sectors.</p>

<p>During this time, the revised <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> Directive will also provide for:</p>

<ul>
<li>a centralised <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide cap on emissions</li>
  <li>an increase in auctioning levels with 100% auctioning to the power sector in the UK</li>
  <li>a non-legally binding commitment from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states to spend at least half of their auctioning revenues to work on climate change</li>
  <li>free allocated allowances to those industrial sectors based on product benchmarks</li>
  <li>sectors that are at risk of relocating outside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> due to the carbon price to receive 100% of the benchmarked allocation for no cost</li>
  <li>sectors not at risk to receive 80% of their benchmarked allocation at no charge in 2013, reduced to 30% in 2020 and 0% in 2027</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>

<p>To comply with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr>, your installation must legally hand over (surrender) enough allowances to cover your emissions from the previous year. Allowances are issued every February for the following year.</p>

<p>The deadline for surrendering allowances is 30 April every year. Failure to comply is met with financial penalties - €100 for every tonne of <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> for which you fail to surrender allowances - plus you have to make up for the shortfall the following year.</p>

<h3 id="greenhouse-gas-permits">Greenhouse gas permits</h3>

<p>A greenhouse gas permit gives you licence to operate an installation that emits <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>. When you apply for a permit, you must also submit a plan for monitoring and reporting emissions. This will require approval from your regulator. This is the Environment Agency for installations in England and Wales or the Department of Energy and Climate Change (<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>) for offshore installations.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/default.aspx">find greenhouse gas permit application details on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="operational-changes">Operational changes</h3>

<p>If the operation of your installation changes, you will need to contact your regulator to see if alterations need to be made to your permit or monitoring plan. Any changes to the way you monitor your emissions, even replacement of a meter, may affect your monitoring plan so you should notify your regulator.</p>

<p>If operations at your installation cease or the emissions drop below threshold levels, you should contact your regulator to see if your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> obligations are affected. A partial or temporary closure will not usually affect your annual allowance allocations, but you should check with your regulator before these closures take place. You should notify your regulator if the temporary closure will extend beyond 50 days.</p>

<p>If your installation closes permanently, allowances for the subsequent year will be withheld. You should apply to your regulator to hand over your permit and provide verified reports up to the date of closure.</p>

<h3 id="monitor-report-and-verify">Monitor, report and verify</h3>

<p>Regulators are responsible for overseeing the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions from installations. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/default.aspx">Find forms and guidance on monitoring and reporting <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You must have all annual reports and monitoring verified by an independent and accredited verifier. Verifiers are private companies, accredited by the UK Accreditation Service, who will charge a fee to check for:</p>

<ul>
<li>inconsistencies in monitoring</li>
  <li>omissions</li>
  <li>misrepresentations</li>
  <li>errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The verifier will also confirm your annual emissions figure and produce a verification opinion statement that will be sent to your regulator. To enable the surrender of an appropriate number of allowances, it is essential you have a verified emissions figure in the registry by 1 April each year. Although you can surrender allowances without a verified report, you take the risk that following later verification there is a shortfall and the €100 per tonne of <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> penalty is enforced.</p>

<h2 id="trading-allowances">Trading allowances</h2>

<p>Each member state of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a national emissions trading registry for greenhouse gas allowances. These online databases are vital components of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> as they enable participants of the scheme to trade allowances.</p>

<p>If you operate an installation with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> obligations, you must open an operator holding account with the UK emissions trading registry. The registry also contains person holding accounts. Any individual or organisation can apply to open such an account.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> Registry is managed by the Environment Agency in the UK. It records:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> allowance allocations for installations</li>
  <li>annual verified emissions</li>
  <li>movement of allowances and units between accounts, including allocations, transfers, surrender and cancellations</li>
  <li>annual reconciliation of allowances and verified emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>Accounts are available through online registration and are subject to a nominal fee, which covers the cost of security checks. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/140761.aspx">find out how to apply for a UK registry account on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You can buy or sell <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> allowances in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>trading directly with other businesses</li>
  <li>buying or selling from intermediaries, eg banks and specialist traders</li>
  <li>using the services of a broker</li>
  <li>joining one of the several exchanges that list carbon allowance products</li>
  <li>UK government or other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state auctions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="auctions">Auctions</h3>

<p>In Phase II of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> (the current phase), the UK government will auction 7% of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> allowances. These competitive auctions are open to anyone who has an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Emissions Trading System">ETS</abbr> Registry account. To place a competitive bid in an auction, you need to submit bids through an intermediary known as a Primary Participant who has direct access to the auctions.</p>

<p>The UK government is also holding non-competitive auctions, which are open to anyone with a greenhouse gas permit from any <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state. In these auctions, participants can submit a bid for up to 10,000 allowances and will pay the clearing price from the competitive auctions.</p>
