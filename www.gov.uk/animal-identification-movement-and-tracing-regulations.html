<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you own a herd, flock or even a single animal of the most common livestock - such as cattle, sheep, goats, deer, horses or pigs - there are rules that you must follow to stop the spread of diseases, particularly those caused by highly contagious viruses. The rules cover the identification, tracing and movement of livestock.</p>

<p>This guide outlines the information you need to on how to identify and move your livestock.</p>

<h2 id="livestock-movement-identification-and-tracing">Livestock movement, identification and tracing</h2>

<p>There are strict requirements that control the identification, tracing and movements of your livestock - which apply even if you have just one animal. Animal identification and traceability is important for disease control and public confidence in farm produce. The regulations that apply to your business depend on the livestock that you keep.</p>

<h3 id="cattle">Cattle</h3>

<p>You must register any cattle you keep with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>). You also need a County Parish Holding (<abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr>) number for the land your cattle will be kept on - before you move them to the holding. If you have a new herd, you need to get a unique herd mark from your local Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency
(<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>). </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Cattle must be identified with two approved eartags, both bearing the animal’s unique number, and any born after 1 July 1996 must be accompanied by a cattle passport.</p>

<p>You can only move your cattle in accordance with the general licence for the movement of cattle, and must inform the British Cattle Movement Service within three days of any cattle movement. Download the general licence for the movement of cattle from the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/cattle/documents/general-licence090713.pdf"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 40K).</a> You should check for foot and mouth symptoms before any movements. If you do find evidence of such disease, you:</p>

<ul>
<li>must notify the Regional Veterinary Lead without delay</li>
  <li>are not permitted to move any animal kept on the premises of departure under the general licence</li>
</ul>
<p>You must record any movement of your cattle - between farms or to slaughter - on the Cattle Tracing System (<abbr title="Cattle Tracing System">CTS</abbr>). This is a computer based system which records identification, deaths and movement of cattle. It allows <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
<li>check animals on a holding</li>
  <li>trace animals at risk of disease</li>
  <li>check where an animal has been</li>
</ul>
<p>Find information on the <abbr title="Cattle Tracing System">CTS</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/110F13E35100367180256F850047324E">Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on moving cattle, read cattle identification, registration and movement.</p>

<h3 id="sheep-and-goats">Sheep and goats</h3>

<p>Rules for sheep and goats are similar to those regarding cattle. You must register with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and apply to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> for a <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> before moving stock to your holding. You can then move your sheep and goats under the general licence for movement of sheep and goats, however, you must report their movement using form AML 1. Download form AML 1 from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/2011/03/30/aml1-animal-move-licensing/"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 569K)</a>.</p>

<p>You must use electronic identification (<abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr>) to aide tracing of sheep. <abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr> replaces the double tagging rules for sheep and allows the animal to be identified through an electronic identifier. <abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr> is not compulsory for goats, though you must still record them on a holding register. </p>

<h3 id="pigs">Pigs</h3>

<p>You must register your pigs with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> by contacting your local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> and supplying them with your <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr>. You can obtain a <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before moving pigs you must apply your individual herd mark to them by:</p>

<ul>
<li>slapmark - a permanent ink mark of your herd mark, applied to each front shoulder area of the pig</li>
  <li>eartag - stamped or printed, not handwritten, containing the letters ‘UK’ followed by your herd mark</li>
  <li>tattoo - of your herd mark on the ear of the pig</li>
  <li>temporary paint mark - eg a red line, black cross or blue circle - which must last until the pig reaches its destination</li>
</ul>
<p>When moving pigs, you must comply with the general licence for the movement of pigs. You can find information on licensing the movement of pigs on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/movements/pigs/"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a> You must complete an AML 2 movement document before you can move your pigs. You must record their movement within 36 hours and retain the document for six months after the move. </p>

<p>For more information, read pigs identification, registration and movement.</p>

<h3 id="other-livestock">Other livestock</h3>

<p>There are also specific rules regarding movement, identification and tracing of deer and horses. For information on deer, read deer health, welfare and movement.</p>

<h2 id="animal-movement-and-licensing">Animal movement and licensing</h2>

<p>To control animal movement and to ensure the location of an animal can be easily identified, all livestock must be moved on a general licence granted by the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. There are four general licences and each one sets out mandatory rules on:</p>

<ul>
<li>cleansing and disinfection</li>
  <li>scheduled stops</li>
  <li>animal identification</li>
  <li>the movement standstill period</li>
  <li>exemptions</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some standard rules for all general licences, which stipulate that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must check for foot and mouth disease before you move any animal and inform the local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> if evidence of the disease is found</li>
  <li>vehicles used for the transport of animals must be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with animal transport regulations</li>
  <li>multiple pick-ups and drop offs of animals is permitted for movements under the licences</li>
  <li>you may transport more than one species of animals</li>
  <li>animal identification must comply with the relevant identification regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the licence that specifically applies to you will depend on the livestock that you are intending to move.</p>

<h3 id="pregnancy-and-other-exceptions-to-using-a-general-licence">Pregnancy and other exceptions to using a general licence</h3>

<p>You are not permitted to move female livestock or animals, or use the general licence to do so, if the animal is in the final 10 per cent of its gestation period, or has calved within the week prior to the planned movement. Such animals are not considered fit for transport, or for presentation at market. To find other instances where the general licences cannot be used, you can find <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/welfare/transport/">guidance on the transporting animals on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="cattle-1">Cattle</h3>

<p>The General Licence for the Movement of Cattle allows all movements of cattle, apart from:</p>

<ul>
<li>between markets</li>
  <li>market to collecting centre - or collecting centre to market</li>
  <li>between collecting centres</li>
  <li>slaughterhouse</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the standard rules and types of movement, the licence also covers:</p>

<ul>
<li>the six day rule - you must wait six days from moving an animal off an area, before introducing a new animal to that area</li>
  <li>scheduled stops - these are allowed, though you must not transfer any animal between vehicles at these stops</li>
  <li>notification - you must notify the British Cattle Movement Service within three days of moving cattle under a licence</li>
</ul>
<p>Download the general licence for the movement of cattle from the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/cattle/documents/general-licence090713.pdf"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 40K).</a></p>

<h3 id="pigs-1">Pigs</h3>

<p>The General Licence for the Movement of Pigs contains the same provisions as the General Licence for the Movement of Cattle, except the six day rule is extended to 20 days.</p>

<p>You can find the general licence for the movement of pigs on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/movements/pigs/"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="sheep-and-goats-1">Sheep and goats</h3>

<p>The General Licence for the Movement of Sheep and Goats also has many similar conditions to the movement of cattle licence - eg types of movement permitted, the six day rule, and scheduled stops.</p>

<p>The main difference between the licences is the movement reporting requirements. You must report all movement of sheep or goats to <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> using the relevant movement document. There are additional report forms to complete if you are moving animals:</p>

<ul>
<li>from an artificial insemination centre</li>
  <li>to market from a standstill - only applies to breeding rams</li>
  <li>intended for the purposes of breeding</li>
</ul>
<p>Download the general licence for the movement of sheep and goats from the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/sheep/documents/generallicence090713.pdf"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 47K).</a></p>

<h3 id="deer">Deer</h3>

<p>The General Licence for Movement of Deer covers the following important provisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>movement permitted - all deer may be moved but</li>
  <li>standstill rules do not apply to deer</li>
  <li>scheduled stops are allowed, but you must not transfer any animals between vehicles</li>
  <li>movements must be reported using form AML 24 and all movements must be accompanied by a movement document</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the general licence for the movement of deer on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/2011/03/30/aml24-deer-movement/"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="animal-movement-licence-forms">Animal Movement Licence Forms</h3>

<p>There are different forms you must complete depending on the animals you are moving, and where you are moving them to or from. An AML 1 is an animal movement report document which must be used to move your sheep and goats onto and off your holding. An AML 2 is an animal movement report document which must be used to move your pigs onto and off your holding.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/tag/movement/">find Animal Movement Licence forms on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You must report all livestock movements to your local authority so the details can be entered onto the Animal Movement Licensing System (<abbr title="Animal Movement Licensing System">AMLS</abbr>). This is a national database that allows farmers, local authorities and government departments to easily trace livestock movements. You can <a rel="external" href="http://amls.defra.gov.uk/">access the AMLS2 database on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (registration required)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="livestock-movements-identification-and-tracing-legislation">Livestock movements, identification and tracing legislation</h2>

<p>There are several general regulations that cover animal gatherings, transport and disease control. They are related to livestock movement restrictions and the times required before animals can be moved onto or away from holdings in order to eliminate the potential spread of disease. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Animal Gatherings (England) Order 2010</li>
  <li>The Transport of Animals (Cleansing and Disinfection) (England) (No.3) Order 2003</li>
  <li>The Disease Control (England) Order 2007</li>
  <li>The Disease Control (England) (Amendment) Order 2008</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cattle-2">Cattle</h3>

<p>Cattle are covered by several pieces of European Union legislation. The regulations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a system for cattle identification and registration through the use of double ear tagging, cattle passports, a fully operational computerised database and up-to-date farm registers</li>
  <li>developing a compulsory labelling system for all beef and beef products</li>
  <li>forming a minimum system of controls for spot inspections of British cattle holdings</li>
  <li>establishing time and reporting limits for cattle registration and ear tagging</li>

  <li>Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (as amended)</li>
</ul>
<p>When moving deer, you must hold a relevant licence and comply with the General Licence of the Movement of Deer. If your deer have been tested for bovine tuberculosis you must make certain that they are tagged appropriately.</p>

<p>Download form AML 24 to report a deer movement from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/files/aml24.pdf"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 807K).</a></p>

<h3 id="pigs-2">Pigs</h3>

<p>Pigs are covered by legislation for record keeping, identification and movement, and disease control with regard to nucleus herds, nucleus/multiplying herds and multiplying herds. These regulations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Pigs (Records, Identification and Movement) Order 2007</li>
  <li>Disease Control (Interim Measures)(England) (No.2) Order 2003 (as amended)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sheep-and-goats-2">Sheep and goats</h3>

<p>Sheep and goats are also covered by legislation regarding record keeping, identification and movement - the Sheep and Goats (Records, Identification and Movement) (England) Order 2009.</p>

<p>Read information on legislation for different livestock on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/movements/cattle/legislation/"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="registering-your-pigs-sheep-and-goats">Registering your pigs, sheep and goats</h2>

<p>To register pigs, sheep and goats, you first must obtain a <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number for the land where the animals will be kept. The <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number is nine digits long. The first two numbers are for your county, the next three are related to the parish and the last four are unique to you as the keeper of the animals. You can apply for your <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> by phoning the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 603 7777.</p>

<p>Once you receive your <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number, your animals can be moved to your holding under a general licence. You’ll then need to register your herd or flock with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> by contacting your nearest <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> by telephone, using your <abbr title="County Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number as a reference. Your livestock will then receive a flock or herd mark to identify them. The flock or herd mark makes it easy to trace the holdings the livestock have been moved from.</p>

<h2 id="electronic-identification-for-sheep-and-goats">Electronic identification for sheep and goats</h2>

<p><abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr> is mandatory for sheep. <abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr> is not currently mandatory for goats because their population falls below the 160,000 threshold. However, goats will still need to be individually recorded on holding/movement documents.</p>

<p>If your sheep are housed overnight, they must be identified within six months of birth. If they are not housed overnight, then they must be identified within nine months of birth. In both cases, the animals must have one electronic identifier and both tags have to bear the same individual identification number.</p>

<p>If they are kept beyond 12 months of age and intended for slaughter, then a single non-electronic tag must be used. It can be electronic if desired.</p>

<p>For further information on electronic tagging, you can call the BCMS Helpline on Tel 0845 050 1234.</p>

<h3 id="movement-documents">Movement documents</h3>

<p>You must individually record sheep and goats born after 31 December 2009 in a movement document. However, you can continue to keep batch records for any slaughter animals and those born before 31 December 2009.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, as of 31 December 2011, you will have to individually record older animals - ie those born before 31 December 2009 - unless they are being moved to slaughter.</p>

<h2 id="livestock-movements-identification-and-tracing-data-protection-statement">Livestock movements, identification and tracing: data protection statement</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, or the National Assembly for Wales, and/or Local Authorities, are data controllers in common of personal data provided in livestock movement documents. </p>

<p>While they may process the same data, they use the information for different purposes, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>recording livestock movements</li>
  <li>enforcing disease control legislation</li>
  <li>breaching of standstill rules</li>
  <li>breaching of multiple pick-up and drop-off rules</li>
