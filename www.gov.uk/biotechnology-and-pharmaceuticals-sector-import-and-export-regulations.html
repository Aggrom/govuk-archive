<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide provides an overview of the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sector, the key regulations you will need to comply with as an exporter or importer and selected sources of further help and support.</p>

<p>You need to know how to comply with export regulations if you plan to trade overseas, and meet all the requirements of importers, including how to comply with domestic regulations and the payment of tariffs and duties on imported goods. It will also help you access details of sector-specific issues of which you should be aware.</p>

<h2 id="export-regulations-for-biotechnology-and-pharmaceuticals-products">Export regulations for biotechnology and pharmaceuticals products</h2>

<p>Regulations, charges or other restrictions may apply to biotechnology and pharmaceutical exports as they leave the UK and when they arrive at their destination country. It is important that you research both sides of the transaction.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports in the life sciences sector by accessing our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">online trade tariff</a></p>
</div>

<p>The above tool will enable you to classify your goods. Using standardised classification codes makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply. </p>

<p>Remember that in general it is much simpler to trade with other EU countries than with countries outside the EU. This is because the goods are in free circulation. The EU is a single market and the UK is in a customs union, so you can trade most goods with other EU countries without restriction. However, biotechnology and pharmaceutical products are likely to be exceptions.</p>

<h3 id="export-licensing-and-certification">Export licensing and certification</h3>

<p>Pharmaceutical products tend to be restricted and stringent licensing requirements are applied. An export licence is required in order to export specified goods with military uses. You may require an export licence for Dual-Use goods which have a potential military use, eg components of chemical and biological weapons. Biotechnologists, for example, must comply with the export control regulations co-ordinated by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) Export Control Organisation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/export-control-organisation/eco-training-skills-academy/eco-films">Watch a video about your export control responsibilities and how you can ensure you have the correct licences on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For information on export licences, read the guide on importing and exporting: overview of controlled goods.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-goods-for-processing">Exporting goods for processing</h3>

<p>You may be able to obtain relief from customs duties when you re-import European Community (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) goods that have previously been exported from the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> for processing. Outward Processing Relief (<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>) enables you to claim relief from customs duty if you can show that the exported goods were used in - or are incorporated into - the products being imported.</p>

<p>Before you can claim duty relief under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>, however, you must have the appropriate authorisation. Read more in the guide on outward processing relief (OPR).</p>

<h2 id="licensing-for-biotechnology-and-pharmaceutical-products">Licensing for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products</h2>

<p>If you export medicines, animals, animal products or plants and related materials, you need to be aware of specific licensing requirements.</p>

<p>If you deal in medicines - including veterinary medicines - within the EU, you must be licensed in the same way as for sales within the UK. If you export to countries outside the EU, you may need a licence to store products within the UK. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=106">Read about licensing requirements on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) website</a></p>

<p>Exports of controlled drugs and precursor chemicals require additional licensing, which must be obtained online from the Home Office.</p>

<p>Launched in 2011, the online National Drugs Control System (<abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr>) administers the UK’s import and export licensing regime for controlled drugs and precursor chemicals. Run by the Home Office, <abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr> aims to speed up licence applications processing. You must register online to use <abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr> before you apply for a licence.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/nds/">Register as a licensee at the <abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr> site to create a user account for controlled drugs and chemical licences</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have completed registration process, import and export licence applications must be made online though the <abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr> portal. You will need to upload supporting documents, such as import permits from the destination country, to the system as well as to the Home Office’s drugs licensing and compliance unit (DLCU).</p>

<p>Export licences will be valid for up to two months, while import licences will be valid for up to three months.</p>

<p>Export controls on other products are administered by the regulatory bodies for each sector. For example, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Export Section licenses medicines for human use.</p>

<p>Contact the International Trade division of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) to arrange health certification for animals and animal products. You can <a rel="external" href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export/">find more information about animal health certificates on the <abbr title="Department for Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also obtain information for plants and related materials from <abbr title="Department for Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s Plant Health Division or the equivalent body in your country. <a rel="external" href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/crops/plant-health/">Read about plant health on the <abbr title="Department for Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>See the guide on plant health controls.</p>

<p>Any trade in products made from endangered plant and animal species must be accompanied by a licence. <a rel="external" href="http://www.cites.org/">Read more about international trade in specimens of endangered species on the <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="researching-your-export-destination-for-biotechnology-and-pharmaceutical-products">Researching your export destination for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products</h2>

<p>When planning to export, you should thoroughly research your export destination country.</p>

<p>There are a number of issues that you ought to consider. As a starting point you may wish to seek advice from UK Trade &amp; Investment (<abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr>). <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/unitedkingdom/contactus.html">Find your local international trade team on the <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports in the life sciences sector by accessing our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">online trade tariff</a></p>
</div>

<p>You can also use the above tool to find out if your goods are affected by restrictions and charges at their destination country, together with all applicable duties and taxes. Key things to check include:</p>

<ul>
<li>prohibitions or quotas on your products</li>
  <li>import licensing restrictions</li>
  <li>rates of duty payable when your goods enter your export market</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider product safety and other technical standards in your export market. Your goods may need to be adapted to comply with these. Rules in your export market may be less or more strict than in the UK.</p>

<p>For a general guide to market information on sectors and countries, see the guide on researching and entering overseas markets.</p>

<p>You can ask for information about your export destination country from a range of organisations, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>your local UK Trade &amp; Investment trade team</li>
  <li>your UK Trade &amp; Investment team within the commercial section of the UK embassy in your destination country</li>
  <li>biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sector trade associations</li>
  <li>the Chambers of Commerce in the UK and in your destination country</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/unitedkingdom/contactus.html">Find your local international trade team on the <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tariffs-and-duties-in-the-biotechnology-and-pharmaceuticals-sector">Tariffs and duties in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sector</h2>

<p>There is a range of import-specific regulations that must be complied with by all businesses in this sector. The key issues relate to the Tariff, duties and Intrastat and intellectual property. </p>

<h3 id="using-the-integrated-tariff">Using the Integrated Tariff</h3>

<p>A common customs tariff is applied across all EU countries on goods imported from outside the EU. Details of specific tariff duties and measures are contained in the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Tariff is used to determine the specific classification code of your goods and to find:</p>

<ul>
<li>any licensing requirements that apply</li>
  <li>the rates of duty and import VAT that apply</li>
  <li>any additional charges, such as anti-dumping duties</li>
  <li>any available preferential duty rates</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preferential-rates-of-duty">Preferential rates of duty</h3>

<p>The Generalised System of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>) allows products from a wide range of countries to be imported in the EU at a reduced or zero rate of duty.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/trade-policy-unit/trade-and-development/gsp">read about the <abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr> on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>The European Community has a number of other preferential trade agreements with third countries, as a result of which goods may attract preferential rates of duty.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000193">Find out if your goods qualify for a preferential rate of duty and meet the appropriate rules of origin on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="intrastat">Intrastat</h3>

<p>If you are VAT registered and the goods you acquire from or supply to VAT-registered businesses in other EU countries reach the Intrastat exemption threshold for the year, you must submit monthly supplementary declarations to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Intrastat thresholds are reviewed annually. The 2011 thresholds are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>Intrastat is the method of collecting information and producing statistics on goods traded between EU member states. See the guide on Intrastat - reporting the value and volume of intra-EU trade . Intrastat is only applicable to VAT-registered traders.</p>

<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual property</h3>

<p>You should ensure that imported goods do not breach the intellectual property rights of other businesses, eg watch out for counterfeit goods and patent infringements. Infringing goods in Europe can be seized and destroyed by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or local customs authorities. You can ask <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to check for imported counterfeit versions of your goods. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000244&amp;propertyType=document#P14_729">Read how <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can help protect your intellectual property rights on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-a-trademark">intellectual property protection overseas</a>.</p>

<h2 id="import-regulations-in-the-biotechnology-and-pharmaceuticals-sector">Import regulations in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sector</h2>

<p>As the EU is a customs union, you can buy goods from other member countries without restrictions - although VAT and excise duty can still apply. For more information, see the guide on trading in the EU. You can also see the page VAT on goods from EU countries in the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/imports/importing.htm">imports and purchases from abroad: paying and reclaiming VAT</a>.</p>

<p>If you import from outside the EU, you may have to comply with import licensing requirements and with common customs tariffs that apply across the EU. For more information, see the guide on imports from outside the EU.</p>

<h3 id="import-licences">Import licences</h3>

<p>Under Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>) legislation, importers or manufacturers of more than one tonne of chemicals a year must register with the European Chemicals Agency. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/index.htm">Read about <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> legislation on the Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>Import restrictions can be product-specific or trade-specific. Many products are subject to product-specific standards and need to be supported by applicable certificates, product-specific licences and documentation.</p>

<p>Quite separately, quantitative restrictions or limitations and anti-dumping duties may apply to certain imported commodities. For more information, see the guide on anti-dumping and countervailing duties.</p>

<p>For help identifying whether you require an import licence see the guide on importing and exporting: overview of controlled goods</p>

<p>The trade in some goods may be prohibited unless you have a specific licence issued by the competent authority. If you import medicines, veterinary medicines or controlled drugs, you must be licensed in the same way as for sales within the UK. In some cases additional licensing is required. Check with the regulatory body in your sub-sector. Additional licences may be required for imports of:</p>

<ul>
<li>medicines or unlicensed medicinal products</li>
  <li>controlled drugs and precursors - <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/nds/">find information about the online National Drugs Control System (<abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr>) import licensing regime for controlled drugs and precursor chemicals on the Home Office website</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have completed the registration process, your licence applications must be made online though the <abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr> portal. You will need to supply supporting documents, such as the Overseas trading partner addresses and preparations form, to <abbr title="National Drugs Control System">NDS</abbr> as well as supplying them to the Home Office. Import licences will be valid for up to three months.</p>

<p>Controls also exist for products of animal origin and plant material:</p>

<ul>
<li>products of animal origin from within the EU must typically be accompanied by a health certificate</li>
  <li>products imported from elsewhere must be inspected at an approved border inspection post <a rel="external" href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export/">(read about international trade in animal products on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website</a>
</li>
  <li>similar requirements apply to imports of plant material</li>
</ul>
<p>Many pharmaceutical products can be imported without customs duty. The Tariff lists which products attract duty.</p>

<p>Goods imported to the UK must comply with domestic business standards. Find out which regulations and licences apply to the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sector.</p>

<h2 id="transport-regulations-for-dangerous-goods-pharmaceuticals">Transport regulations for dangerous goods (pharmaceuticals)</h2>

<p>Many goods used in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals are potentially hazardous. You must ensure they are properly packaged and handled, and special documentation is required. Some types of goods are subject to particular rules, such as pesticides and biocides.</p>

<p>The requirements depend on the nature of the goods and how they’re being transported. For example, transport of oil by sea presents different pollution risks from transport by road or rail. Similarly, higher risks are associated with transporting, for example, chloroform by air than by road (where the container can be ventilated).</p>

<p>There are three broad sets of international regulations:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/cdg/index.htm">read about carriage of dangerous goods by road or rail on the Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/Pages/DangerousGoods.aspx">find out about shipping dangerous goods on the International Maritime Organisation (<abbr title="International Maritime Organisation">IMO</abbr>) website</a></li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/">read about transporting dangerous goods by air on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) website</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Key requirements generally include ensuring that goods are appropriately classified, packaged and labelled. It is also important that everyone involved understands how to minimise risks. Special training may be required.</p>

<p>In practice, you may use a specialist freight forwarder to handle your goods. However, it is still your responsibility to provide the right information to them. Completing a dangerous goods note is an effective way to do this for international shipments. See the page on the [Dangerous Goods Note] in the guide on transport document completion.</p>
