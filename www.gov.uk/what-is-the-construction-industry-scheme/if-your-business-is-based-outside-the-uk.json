It's an agreement between 2 countries to reduce the amount of tax that's actually paid. \r\n\r\nThe aim is to make sure you only pay the same, or close to the same, amount of tax as you would have paid if you'd earned the income at home.\r\n\r\nIf you're a non-resident subcontractor and your country has a double taxation agreement with the UK, you might be able to claim back some of the CIS deductions that contractors have made from your payments.\r\n\r\nIf there's no double taxation agreement you won't be exempt from UK tax, but CIS deductions contractors make from your payments count towards your tax bill.\r\n\r\nThis means HMRC will reduce your tax bill for the year by the amount that's already been paid in deductions.\r\n\r\n^There's more information on double taxation agreements and claiming back tax on the [HMRC website.](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/large-other/non-uk-cis.htm \"HMRC website\"){:rel=\"external\"}^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*[CIS]: Construction Industry Scheme\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenue & Customs\r\n*[CAR]: Charity, Assets and Residence","slug":"if-your-business-is-based-outside-the-uk","title":"If your business is based outside the UK"}}],"type":"guide"}
