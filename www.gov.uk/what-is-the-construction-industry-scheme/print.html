  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="how-cis-works"><header><h1>Part 1: How CIS works</h1>
  </header><p>The Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>) is administered by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). It regulates payments from contractors to subcontractors in the building industry. </p>

<p>All building contractors and subcontractors should register with the scheme. </p>

<h2>Who is a <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> contractor?</h2>

<p>Anyone who uses subcontractors for construction work needs to <a href="/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-contractor/register-with-cis" title="register as a CIS contractor">register as a <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> contractor</a> with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Who is a <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> subcontractor?</h2>

<p>If you’re self-employed and agree to do construction work for a contractor, you’re a <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> subcontractor. You should <a href="/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-subcontractor/register-with-cis" title="register as a CIS subcontractor">register with <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Subcontractors can also be companies.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re a contractor and subcontractor, you must register as both.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other people and organisations covered by <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Apart from builders, <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> can also apply to:</p>

<ul>
<li>labour agencies and staff bureaux </li>
  <li>gangmasters (or gang leaders)</li>
  <li>property developers</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your organisation doesn’t do building work, you still have to register if you spend more than an average of £1 million a year on construction over a 3-year period. </p>

<p>Organisations where this could apply include:</p>

<ul>
<li>housing associations or ‘arm’s length’ management organisations (<abbr title="arm's length management organisations">ALMOs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>local authorities  </li>
  <li>government departments</li>
  <li>other public bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more information on who <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> applies to in the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> guide for contractors and subcontractors.</p>

</article><article id="when-cis-doesnt-apply"><header><h1>Part 3: When CIS doesn't apply</h1>
  </header><p>Some types of work aren’t covered by the Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>). If you’re only doing this type of work, you don’t need to register.</p>

<p>For example, work done by businesses like architects and surveyors isn’t covered. Manufacturing things off site (eg windows, blinds and shutters) also isn’t covered. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you do any work that’s covered by <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> you must register even if not all your work is covered.</p>
</div>

<p>There’s a full list of types of construction work included and excluded from <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> in the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> guide for contractors and subcontractors.</p>

</div>

<p>If you’re a contractor, <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> rules also don’t apply when:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re paying for construction work on property for your own business use (this only applies to contractors who spend more than £1 million a year on average)</li>
  <li>you’re paying for a construction contract worth less than £1,000 (excluding materials) - you need to get authorisation from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) to exempt it </li>
  <li>the work is being paid for by a governing body or head teacher of a maintained school on behalf of the local education authority</li>
  <li>the work is being paid for by a charity or trust</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only get permission to exempt payments less than £1,000 if you’re a contractor spending more than £1 million a year on average. To get permission, call the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> helpline:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> helpline</strong><br>
0845 366 7899<br>
8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday<br>
8am to 4pm, Saturday</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are no exemptions for subcontractors, and private householders are never treated as <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> contractors - regardless of how much they spend.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-your-business-is-based-outside-the-uk"><header><h1>Part 4: If your business is based outside the UK</h1>
  </header><p>The Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>) covers almost all types of construction work done in the UK. It doesn’t matter if your business is based in the UK or not.</p>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) classes you a ‘non-resident business’ if you’re based outside the UK. No matter where you’re based, <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> still applies if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>a contractor who pays subcontractors for construction work they do in the UK</li>
  <li>a subcontractor who gets paid by contractors for doing construction work in the UK</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This means that if you’re a non-resident business you have to follow the same <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> rules as UK-based <a href="/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-contractor/register-with-cis" title="what you must do as a CIS contractor">contractors</a> and <a href="/what-you-must-do-as-a-cis-subcontractor/register-with-cis" title="what you must do as a CIS subcontractor">subcontractors</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>It doesn’t matter where payment is made - it’s just down to the work you’re doing and whether it’s covered by <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>.</p>

<p>There’s a full list of types of construction work included and excluded from <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> in the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> guide for contractors and subcontractors.</p>

<h2>How to register</h2>

<p>You must register before any work starts. Register by contacting the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Charity, Assets and Residence (<abbr title="Charity, Assets and Residence">CAR</abbr>) - <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> team. </p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Charity, Assets and Residence">CAR</abbr> <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> team</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0151 472 6273<br><strong>If calling from outside UK:</strong> + 44 151 472 6273</p>
</div>

<p>Or you can write to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Charity, Assets and Residence">CAR</abbr>  
<br>Personal Tax International

<br></p></div></div>

<h2>Double taxation agreements and claiming back tax</h2>

<p>This is when income gets taxed in 2 countries - the one where your business is resident and the one where you earn the income. It’s an agreement between 2 countries to reduce the amount of tax that’s actually paid. </p>

<p>The aim is to make sure you only pay the same, or close to the same, amount of tax as you would have paid if you’d earned the income at home.</p>

<p>If you’re a non-resident subcontractor and your country has a double taxation agreement with the UK, you might be able to claim back some of the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> deductions that contractors have made from your payments.</p>

<p>If there’s no double taxation agreement you won’t be exempt from UK tax, but <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> deductions contractors make from your payments count towards your tax bill.</p>

<p>This means <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will reduce your tax bill for the year by the amount that’s already been paid in deductions.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s more information on double taxation agreements and claiming back tax on the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/large-other/non-uk-cis.htm" title="HMRC website" rel="external"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>
