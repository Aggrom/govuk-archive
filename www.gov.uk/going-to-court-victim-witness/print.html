</header><article id="help-getting-to-the-court"><header><h1>Part 1: Help getting to the court</h1>
  </header><h2>If you’re a victim or prosecution witness</h2>

<p>If you’re a victim of crime or a witness for the prosecution, a witness care officer will let you know the date of the trial.</p>

<p>Ask the witness care officer for any help you need going to court, eg with childcare or transport.</p>

<p>You can also ask them if you’d like to visit the court before the trial, so you know what to expect on the day</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Witness care officers work for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
</div>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="contact the court">Contact the court</a> if you need special help in the court room - eg if you are disabled.</p>

<h2>If you’re a defence witness</h2>

<p>If you are a witness for the defence, the defence lawyer will let you know when you have to go to court.</p>

<p>You can contact a service based in the court called the Witness Service if you need help getting to the court.</p>

<p>Find your local service by contacting <a rel="external" href="http://www.victimsupport.org/Contact%20us" title="Victim Support">Victim Support.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you can’t make the date of the trial, tell your witness care officer or the defence lawyer straight away.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="expenses-for-going-to-court"><header><h1>Part 2: Expenses for going to court</h1>
  </header><p>You can claim for expenses for going to court to give evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>travelling expenses</strong> - the standard or 2nd class fare, or 25p per mile if you drive</li>
  <li>
<strong>meals and refreshments</strong> - £2.25 for up to 5 hours, or £4.50 for 5 to 10 hours</li>
  <li>
<strong>loss of earnings</strong> - £33.50 for up to 4 hours, or £67 for longer (£42.95 or £85.90 if you’re self-employed)</li>
  <li>
<strong>child care</strong> - £67 per day</li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer does not have to pay you for time off work when you appear as a witness.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a rel="external" href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/v_to_z/witnesses_expenses_and_allowances/" title="witness expenses and allowances">witness expenses and allowances.</a></p>

<p>Ask your solicitor or a court official for an expenses form when you go to court.</p>

</article><article id="review-your-statement"><header><h1>Part 3: Review your statement</h1>
  </header><p>If you have given a statement to the police, it may have been a while since you’ve seen it.</p>

<p>You can ask the <a rel="external" href="http://www.police.uk/?view=force_sites/" title="police">police</a> to see the statement again before you go to court to refresh your memory.</p>

<p>If you have been called as a prosecution witness, ask <a rel="external" href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/your_cps/our_organisation/the_cps_areas.html" title="the Crown Prosecution Service">the Crown Prosecution Service</a> to see the statement.</p>

</article><article id="help-and-support-in-the-court"><header><h1>Part 4: Help and support in the court</h1>
  </header><h2>Getting support on the day</h2>

<p>The Witness Service at the court can give you personal support on the day of the trial - eg someone to go with you into the court-room.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Witness Service is run by Victim Support, and helps all witnesses in the court.</p>
</div>

<p>You can find your local Witness Service by contacting <a rel="external" href="http://www.victimsupport.org/Contact%20us" title="Victim Support">Victim Support.</a></p>

<h2>Waiting to be called</h2>

<p>If you’re a victim or prosecution witness there should be a separate room where you can wait.</p>

<p>This is so you won’t have to meet the defendant or their family and friends before the trial.</p>

<p>If there isn’t a separate area, speak to court staff - they can make sure you’re safe.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If anyone tries to intimidate you, tell your solicitor or court staff, who will report it to the police.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="extra-protection-in-the-courtroom"><header><h1>Part 5: Extra protection in the court-room</h1>
  </header><p>The court may be able to take extra steps to protect you if you are:</p>

<ul>
<li>under 18</li>
  <li>disabled</li>
  <li>afraid to give evidence</li>
  <li>a victim of a sexual offence</li>
</ul>
<p>These could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>screens to stop you from having to see the defendant</li>
  <li>giving evidence via a live CCTV link</li>
  <li>asking the public to leave the court room when you give evidence, if the case is about a sexual offence</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Speak to the police officer, witness care officer or the solicitor who asked you to come to court if you need extra protection.</p>
