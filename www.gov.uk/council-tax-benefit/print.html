  </header><p>Council Tax Benefit is money off your Council Tax bill.  </p>

<p>How much reduction you get depends on your circumstances - eg your income, if you have children.  </p>

<p>You can get other types of help to pay your Council Tax if:  </p>

<ul>
<li>you live with another adult (who isn’t your partner) - known as the <a href="/council-tax-benefit/eligibility" title="Second Adult Rebate">Second Adult Rebate</a>
</li>
  <li>your <a href="/council-tax-benefit/further-information" title="Extended Payment of Council Tax Benefit">benefits have stopped</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply for Council Tax Benefit whether you own your home, rent, are unemployed or working.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>Council Tax Benefit is a reduction (money off) your Council Tax bill. </p>

  <li>your household income - this includes things like savings (over £6,000), pension, your partner’s income</li>
  <li>if your children live with you </li>
  <li>if other adults live with you</li>
</ul>
<p>Your council will send you a bill showing how much your reduction is and what you have to pay.</p>
