  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing meals for your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>What you have to report and pay depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the value of the meals</li>
  <li>if they’re in a workplace canteen open to all staff</li>
  <li>if they take place on or off your premises</li>
  <li>if they’re paid for through employee ‘accounts’ or vouchers</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax and National Insurance if you offer all your employees:</p>

<ul>
<li>free or subsidised meals of a reasonable value at a workplace canteen</li>
  <li>vouchers that cover the cost of buying these meals</li>
  <li>vouchers worth up to 15p per day</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you offer these meals or vouchers under <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/payroll/special-pay/salary-sacrifice.htm" title="salary sacrifice" rel="external">salary sacrifice</a> or <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim21676.htm" title="flexible remuneration arrangements" rel="external">flexible remuneration arrangements</a> (also known as ‘flexible benefit plans’), these won’t be exempt.</p>
</div>

<h2>Free or subsidised meals for low-earning employees</h2>

<p>You don’t have to pay or report on these meals for employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year.</p>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the meals or vouchers you provide aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-meals-for-employees-and-directors/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on the costs.</p>

<h2>Free or subsidised meals that aren’t exempt</h2>

<p>This includes meals that:</p>

<ul>
<li>aren’t on a reasonable scale, eg elaborate meals with fine wines</li>
  <li>are provided off-site but not at a canteen, eg at a restaurant</li>
  <li>aren’t available to all staff, eg meals for directors only</li>
  <li>provided under <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/payroll/special-pay/salary-sacrifice.htm" title="salary sacrifice">salary sacrifice</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim21676.htm" title="flexible remuneration arrangements">flexible remuneration arrangements</a> (also known as ‘flexible benefit plans’)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide these meals to employees earning at a rate of £8,500 a year or more, or directors, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section M</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the cost to you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vouchers for meals outside the workplace</h2>

<p>You need to report and pay on the cost of vouchers above 15p per day.</p>
