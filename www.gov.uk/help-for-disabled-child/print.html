    <section role="main"><header><h1>Help if you have a disabled child, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Your local council can provide help if you have a disabled child, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/apply-short-term-care-for-child" title="Apply for short-term care for your child">short break services</a></li>
  <li>holiday play schemes</li>
  <li>care at home</li>
  <li>some aids and adaptations</li>
  <li>financial help (eg money towards travel costs for hospital visits)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your council has a duty to provide these services under <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/contents" title="The Children Act 1989">the Children Act 1989.</a> Some are free of charge - the council might ask you to contribute towards others.</p>

<p>If you think your child may qualify, contact the social services team at <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">your local council</a>.</p>

<p>A social worker will then talk to you about the needs of your family, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>health</li>
  <li>social care</li>
  <li>education</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called a ‘needs assessment’ - the social worker will give you advice on what to do next.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can also ask your council about local support groups for carers and families with disabled children.</p>
</div>

<h2>Help with costs</h2>

<p>If your child qualifies for services from your local council, you’ll also have the option of getting <a href="/apply-direct-payments" title="direct payments">direct payments</a>.  </p>

<p>These are paid directly to you so you can arrange services you need. They’re an alternative to social care services provided by your local council.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may also be eligible for extra <a href="/child-tax-credit" title="Child Tax Credit">Child Tax Credit</a> for each disabled child you’re responsible for.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="early-support-programme"><header><h1>Part 2: Early Support Programme</h1>
  </header><p>The Early Support Programme is for parents and carers of disabled children aged 5 and under. This includes support for:</p>

<ul>
<li>health</li>
  <li>education</li>
  <li>social care</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to join</h2>

<p>To find out if the Early Support Programme is running in your area, contact <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">your local council</a>.</p>

<p>If it’s not yet running where you live, ask when it will be introduced.</p>

<p>Once you’ve joined the programme, a key worker will be assigned to help you.</p>

<h2>Resources to help you</h2>

<p>The Early Support Programme has a range of <a rel="external" href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/EarlySupport/Page1" title="Early Support">materials</a> to help families with a disabled child.  These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a rel="external" href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/ES1" title="Early Support: Family pack">family pack</a> with information about services available </li>
  <li>booklets on a range of disabilities</li>
  <li>training courses for families and carers </li>
</ul></article><article id="childcare"><header><h1>Part 3: Childcare</h1>
  </header><p>Your local council’s <a href="/find-family-information-service" title="Family Information Service">Family Information Service</a> can give you details about childcare in your local area. </p>

<p>You can also ask them about other specialist services that your child may need because of their disability. </p>

<h2>Help with childcare costs</h2>

<p>All 3 and 4 year olds are entitled to 15 hours of free education for 38 weeks of the year - read the information on <a href="/childcare-tax-credits" title="childcare and tax credits">childcare and tax credits</a> for more details. </p>

<p>You can also get <a href="/apply-direct-payments" title="direct payments">direct payments</a> from your local council to help pay for childcare.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re on the <a href="early-support-programme" title="Early Support Programme">Early Support Programme</a> and have a Family File, show this to your childcare provider.</p>

</article><article id="education"><header><h1>Part 4: Education</h1>
  </header><p>Under the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/6" title="Equality Act 2010">Equality Act 2010,</a> it’s against the law for schools and other education providers to discriminate against disabled children. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>a school can’t refuse admission to disabled children just because of their disability </li>
  <li>a school can’t stop a disabled pupil going outside at break time because it takes them longer to get there </li>
  <li>a teacher can’t shout at a disabled child if their disability means they have trouble concentrating </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can <a href="/discrimination-your-rights/contact-the-equality-and-human-rights-commission" title="contact the Equality and Human Rights Commission">contact the Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> if you think your child has been discriminated against because of their disability.</p>
</div>

<h2>Making ‘reasonable adjustments’</h2>

<p>Schools have to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ for disabled children. These can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>changes to physical features (eg adding a ramp)</li>
  <li>changes to how learners are assessed</li>
  <li>providing extra support and aids (eg specialist teachers or equipment)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special educational needs</h2>

<p>Some children may have <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs" title="special educational needs">special educational needs</a> because their disabilities affect their ability to learn.</p>

<p>You can ask your council to carry out a <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs/assessments" title="special educational needs assessment">special educational needs assessment</a> for your child. They may get a <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs/statements" title="statement of special educational needs">statement of special educational needs</a> afterwards.</p>

<p>If your child has a statement of special educational needs, your local educational authority has to provide support as they approach leaving school. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Ask to see a school’s policy on special educational needs so you know what support they can offer.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="home-adaptations"><header><h1>Part 6: Home adaptations</h1>
  </header><p>If your home needs to be adapted to meet your child’s needs, you may be able to get a <a href="/disabled-facilities-grants" title="Disabled Facilities Grant">Disabled Facilities Grant</a> to help with the costs.</p>

<p>Usually, an occupational therapist will talk to you to work out what adaptations would be best for your child. </p>
