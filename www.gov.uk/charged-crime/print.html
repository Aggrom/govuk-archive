  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you are charged with a crime you will be given a ‘charge sheet’. This sets out the details of the crime you are being charged with.</p>

<p>The police will decide if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>can go home until the court hearing - but may have to follow certain rules, known as ‘bail’</li>
  <li>are kept in police custody until you are taken to court for your hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>Your first court hearing after you are charged with a crime will be at a <a href="/courts/magistrates-courts" title="Magistrates’ courts">magistrates’ court</a> or a <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/video-conferences" title="video conferencing in court">‘virtual court’</a> using video technology - even if your trial will be at a <a href="/courts/crown-court" title="Crown Courts">Crown Court</a> later on.</p>

<h2>Young people</h2>

<p>If you’re under 18, your first hearing will usually be at a <a href="/courts/youth-courts" title="Youth courts">youth court</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re under 17, the police must arrange for you to be held in local authority accommodation, if possible, before you go to court.</p>

<p>If you’re aged 12 to 16, the police can decide to keep you at the police station if they think it will protect the public.</p>

</article><article id="bail"><header><h1>Part 2: Bail</h1>
  </header><p>You can be released on bail at the police station after you’ve been charged. This means you will be able to go home until your court hearing.</p>

<p>If you are given bail, you might have to agree to conditions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>living at a particular address</li>
  <li>not contacting certain people</li>
  <li>giving your passport to the police so you can’t leave the UK</li>
  <li>reporting to a police station at agreed times, eg once a week</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t stick to these conditions you can be arrested again and be taken to prison to wait for your court hearing.</p>

<p>When you attend your hearing at a <a href="/courts/magistrates-courts" title="Magistrates’ courts">magistrates’ court</a> or a ‘virtual court’ - <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/video-conferences" title="video conferencing in court">video conferencing in court</a> - you might be given bail again until your trial begins. </p>

<h3>Reasons you may not be given bail</h3>

<p>You’re unlikely to be given bail if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you are charged with a serious offence, eg armed robbery</li>
  <li>you’ve been convicted of a serious crime in the past</li>
  <li>you’ve been given bail in the past and not stuck to the terms</li>
  <li>the police think you may not turn up for your hearing</li>
  <li>the police think you might commit a crime while you’re on bail</li>
</ul></article><article id="remand"><header><h1>Part 3: Remand</h1>
  </header><p>If the court decides to put you on remand it means you will go to prison until your hearing at a <a href="/courts/magistrates-courts" title="Magistrates’ courts">magistrates’ court</a>.</p>

<p>If you are under 18 you will be taken to a <a href="/young-people-in-custody/" title="Young people in custody">secure centre for young people</a>, not an adult prison.</p>

<p>You will probably be put on remand if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have been charged with a serious crime, eg armed robbery</li>
  <li>you have been convicted of a serious crime in the past</li>
  <li>the police think you may not go to your court hearing</li>
  <li>the police think you may commit another crime while on bail</li>
  <li>you have been given bail before and not stuck to the terms</li>
</ul>
<p>When you attend your hearing at a magistrates’ court, you might be put on remand again until your trial begins, even if you were previously given bail.</p>
