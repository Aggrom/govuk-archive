The panel must be independent.\r\n\r\ns1. The admission authority will explain why they turned down your application.\r\ns2. You'll be able to give your own reasons why your child should be admitted.\r\ns3. The appeals panel must decide if the school's admission criteria were properly followed and are legal according to the [School Admissions Code.](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schooladmissions/a00195/school-admissions-codes-and-regulations \"School Admissions Code\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\ns4.

If the criteria weren't properly followed or are illegal, your appeal must be upheld.\r\ns6. If your appeal has not already been upheld, the panel will decide if your reasons for your child to be admitted outweigh the school\u2019s reasons for not admitting another child.\r\ns7. The panel will send you and the admission authority their decision within 5 school days.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Complaining about the appeals process\r\n\r\nThe panel's decision can only be overturned by a court. If there's a change in your circumstances which could affect the decision, you may be able to apply to appeal again.
