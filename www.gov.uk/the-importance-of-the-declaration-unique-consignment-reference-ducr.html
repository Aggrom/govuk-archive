<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Declaration Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>) and the optional Part suffix is the main reference key to any Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) declaration. It is also the primary data item for matching import consignments containing plants, flowers, fresh fruit and vegetables on the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration and any Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates (<abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>) Advance Notification.</p>

<p>For example, where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and Part are created by separate individuals - ie Advanced Notifications by the importer and import declarations by the agent - the communication of the precise format of <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, including any Part suffix (optionally completed), will be of paramount importance to ensure an exact match can be achieved.</p>

<p>The importance of achieving a match is that the Automatic Licence Verification System (<abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr>) can transmit decisions to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> in near real time resulting in automatic clearance for consignments granted green (release) decisions from the matching <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification.</p>

<h2 id="the-format-of-the-ducr">The format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> should conform to the Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>) structure recommended by the World Customs Organisation (<abbr title="World Customs Organisation">WCO</abbr>).</p>

<p>The format of a trader generated <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is year - country - Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) - traders’ reference - where:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘Year’ - is the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated. For example, ‘9’ if allocated in 2009, ‘0’ if allocated in 2010 and ‘1’ if allocated in 2011. Therefore for the year 2009, ensure the year component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered onto the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> advance notification contains the single ‘9’ digit and not ‘09’. In 2010, enter the year as a single ‘0’ digit and not ‘10’</li>
  <li>‘Country’ - is the country where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated</li>
  <li>‘<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>’ - is the identity of the trader as known to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). In the UK this is the 12 character <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</li>
  <li>’-‘ - is a dash</li>
  <li>‘Reference’ - is a unique series of characters that the trader, whose <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, devises and which provides an audit trail within traders’ commercial records. This component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a positive outcome from <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and optionally completed Part suffix matching is achieved, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference quoted within the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification and the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> import declaration will need to be identical to meet the requirements of the Automatic Licence Verification matching algorithm.</p>

<p>Equally, failure to complete the declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> on the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration will mean that <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will generate a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reflecting the entry number details resulting in a mismatch situation and potentially incurring delays in customs clearance.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> generates a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> because a genuine <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> has not been completed on the Import declaration, the corresponding <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> application will require amending to match the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference created on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="the-ducr-part-suffix">The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part suffix</h2>

<p>Whilst it is recommended that unique <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> are specified from traders’ own commercial records (this can be anything unique to the trader), the use of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part suffix allows two or more Import declarations to have the same core <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>On <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, up to four characters have been made available for the Part suffix that, in combination with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> (of up to 35 characters), must be unique.</p>

<p>Whilst the optionally completed <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part suffix can contain a three-digit ‘Part’ Number and an optional alpha check letter - for example ‘001A’ - <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> will not permit you to enter the alpha check letter into the optional Part Number field.</p>

<p>The alpha character check letter is ignored by the <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> in matching. In the above example, the Part number would be entered in the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification Part field as ‘001’.</p>

<p>Part Numbers can be entered with leading zeros in both <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>. Where a Part Number is used, the same exact Part Number must be entered, unless you wish to take advantage of Bulk Matching.</p>

<p>For example, if you enter a Part of ‘03’ into <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>, then the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Part must be entered as ‘03’ and not ‘3’ or ‘003’.</p>

<h2 id="the-avls-matching-process">The AVLS matching process</h2>

<p>Flexibility has been built into the <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> matching solution. To ensure that where identical <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> are entered on multiple <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> applications, <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> can handle ‘one’ to ‘many’ and ‘many’ to ‘many’ relationships between Advance Notifications and <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> import declarations.</p>

<p><abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> offers two types of matching, known as Single rule matching and Bulk rule matching. <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> will attempt to match your <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> consignment lines to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration items initially using Single rule matching and then Bulk rule matching.</p>

<h2 id="import-declarations-for-containers-with-mixed-products">Import declarations for containers with mixed products</h2>

<p>For multiple or single containers where each of the Advance Notifications contain mixed commodities and/or varieties that subsequently obtain a green release decision from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) or the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>), under the Bulk matching rule a multi-item import declaration can be submitted to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> - same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> but entering a Part suffix - that reflects on each item of the declaration, the different commodities or varieties.</p>

<h2 id="refused-peach-decisions">Refused <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> decisions</h2>

<p>Depending on the type of issue notified to you by the inspection bodies, you will need to work with them to resolve the situation. To obtain clearance for any ‘green ball’ consignments held alongside those acted on, it is possible that you will have to amend submissions already made.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the correction options available on <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> and <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> are outlined below.</p>

<p>Where a second <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration is subsequently required to clear a refused <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> application, for example in respect of a documentary check failure for one of the multiple containers, the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> application with the refused consignment will either:</p>

<ul>
<li>require amendment to the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> on the application line with the refused consignment</li>
  <li>be cancelled altogether and two new <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> applications created to separate out released consignments from any refused ones</li>
</ul>
<p>The new <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> application can either have the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> as the original <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> application but with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part suffix entered or a completely new <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> with no Part suffix.</p>

<p>To achieve a match whenever the <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> receives an amended or new Import declaration to resolve a refused decision, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and Part suffix entered on <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> must be identical to the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and Part suffix entered on the second <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration covering the refused consignment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> will not receive or match scenarios involving re-processing (including movement for correction - HCG4), seized, destroyed or re-exported consignments. These will be handled under existing manual processes.</p>

<h2 id="making-the-matching-process-for-peach-certificates">Making the matching process for <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> certificates</h2>

<p>To increase the likelihood that a timely and successful matching process takes place you are encouraged to submit the Advance Notification to <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>for arrivals by air - at least four working hours notice</li>
  <li>in all other instances - at least three working days notice, in advance of the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> import declaration, including any pre-lodged import declarations</li>
</ul>
<p>This sequence will enable you to establish the results of the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate or Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate decisions in advance and allow you to reflect how you submit your customs declarations to reflect differing types of <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> decisions - to separate out green (release) decisions from any red or white failures.</p>

<h2 id="detailed-options-and-explanations-regarding-ducr-matching">Detailed options and explanations regarding <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> matching</h2>

<p>There are several different types of <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> matching rules which have different requirements.</p>

<h3 id="single-rule-matching">Single rule matching</h3>

<p>The single rule matching requires that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and Part combination provided on the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration and <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification are to be exactly the same</li>
  <li>where no Part is to be used then the Part must not be entered on both the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification and <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration</li>
  <li>more than one Advance Notification can have the same repeated <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and Part to facilitate individual item to consignment line matching where more than four items are required to be matched - a single <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification contains a maximum of four consignment lines</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bulk-rule-matching">Bulk rule matching</h3>

<p>Bulk rule matching has been provided to facilitate traders who complete <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> applications on the basis of one application per container as a result of the commercial invoice, packing list and phytosanitory certificate being documented separately.</p>

<p>Bulk rule matching requires that:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and a Part combination must be provided on the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration</li>
  <li>each <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification should only contain a single consignment line with the same exact <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> as the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration but no Part must be recorded</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiple-containers-on-a-single-vessel">Multiple containers on a single vessel</h3>

<p>When dealing with multiple containers on a single vessel or voyage, there are two approaches to the creation of the containers to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate and Plant Health in the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification. You can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a separate <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification for each container - ensure that only one consignment line is in the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification</li>
  <li>create a single <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification, enter each container as a consignment line up to a maximum of four consignment lines. If necessary continue entering additional consignments on further <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notifications as required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-to-handle-defra-or-rpa-released-consignments-before-other-held-consignments">Choosing to handle <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> or <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> ‘released’ consignments before other ‘held’ consignments</h2>

<p>If, for commercial reasons, you wish to obtain a <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> release for those consignments that already have release decisions and you do not wish to wait for remaining release decisions, then this can only be done by creating separate <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declarations.</p>

<p>If you decide to do this, where multiple <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> released consignments involve different Integrated Tariff of the European Community (<abbr title="Integrated Tariff of the European Community">TARIC</abbr>) codes you must create a <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration containing an item for each <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> consignment line that has all its necessary release decisions. Each item must be created with a weight to match the total weight of each released consignment.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-peach-consignments-for-a-single-chief-declaration">Multiple <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> consignments for a Single <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> declaration</h3>

<p>Where you have multiple <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> released consignment lines which all map to the same <abbr title="Integrated Tariff of the European Community">TARIC</abbr> code then you can create a single corresponding item on the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration with a weight matching the summed total weight of those consignment lines.</p>

<p>Having created the Import declaration, in most circumstances this will result in <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> matching the item/s to the consignments and sending the release decisions through to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. The Import declaration will be automatically released and those consignments on the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification will become finalised.</p>

<p>When any remaining held consignments have received their release decisions in <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> then an additional <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import Declaration will need to be created. The additional Import declaration can contain the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> as the previously released Import declaration, but remember <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will not permit two Import declarations to co-exist with the same exact <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and Part combination.</p>

<h3 id="same-ducr-but-new-part-suffix-in-the-new-import-declaration">Same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> but new Part suffix in the new Import declaration</h3>

<p>If you use the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> but a new Part suffix in the new Import declaration then:</p>

<ul>
<li>no <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> amendment should be required to facilitate the <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> release</li>
  <li>create the Import declaration with only the item/s that now have release decisions</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> should match those items to those consignments and cause that Import declaration to be released</li>
  <li>once released in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, those consignments on the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification will be finalised</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to use a new <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> in your new Import declaration then you will have to use the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Amend function to change the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> on the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notifications which contain the newly-released consignments.</p>

<p>You need to be aware that amendment of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> or Part on Advance Notifications may not be possible if the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification you wish to amend has already been finalised, as they contain consignments already released. In such cases you should consider using the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and a new Part suffix in the new <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration.</p>

<h3 id="additional-steps-required-for-early-release">Additional steps required for early release</h3>

<p>There can be some unique circumstances where <abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> is not able to automatically supply the release decisions to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> to facilitate automated release of the Import declaration. This can happen where there are <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> consignments that share the same exact <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and Part combination and all have the same <abbr title="Integrated Tariff of the European Community">TARIC</abbr> mapping as some of those consignments you wish to release, whilst others still have hold decisions.</p>

<p>For example, if you have multiple <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> consignment of apples of variety ‘Cox Pippin’ with release decisions and also a <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> consignment of variety ‘Braeburn’ which is still being held, in such a case you should first attempt to create the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration with each item representing each consignment line with matching individual weights. This should allow the Import declaration to be released.</p>

<p>If however you wish to create the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration with a single item representing the total summed weight of the released consignment lines then an additional <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Amend step will be required.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Amend function must be used to change either the Part number or the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> of the Advance Notifications containing the non-released consignments. The type of <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> amendment you make will depend on your decision as to whether the new <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration you will create for the non-released consignments will contain the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and a Part combination not already used, or whether a new, different <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> will be used.</p>

<p>Once the appropriate <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> amendments have been made to those <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> advance notifications then:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Automatic Licence Verification System">ALVS</abbr> should be able to match the initial released consignment lines to the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration</li>
  <li>an automated release of the Import declaration will occur</li>
</ul>
<p>When the remaining held consignments have received their release decisions then an additional <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Import declaration will have to be created with the item(s) that now have release decisions.</p>

<p>This new Import declaration must contain the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> (and Part if applicable) that you amended on the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification.</p>
