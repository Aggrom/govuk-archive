  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="your-family-lives-abroad"><header><h1>Part 1: Your family lives abroad</h1>
  </header><h2>If your partner isn’t in the UK - and you don’t have children</h2>
<p>If you’ve come to the UK, are working and your partner has stayed behind in their own country, you may get <a href="/working-tax-credit" title="Working Tax Credit">Working Tax Credit</a> as a single person. </p>

<p>If your partner joins you in the UK you’ll need to let the Tax Credit Office know within a month. This is because your tax credits payments may change.</p>

<h2>Your child lives abroad</h2>
<p>If you’re working, you’ll normally just get paid Working Tax Credit as a single person.</p>

<p>Because you have a child, you may be able to get Child Tax Credit as well if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you work in the UK</li>
  <li>you have a right to reside in the UK</li>
  <li>you pay National Insurance contributions here</li>
  <li>your child lives in a country in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or in Switzerland with your partner or someone else - and depend on you to support them</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, you can’t claim for a child who lives outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland. An exception to this is if your partner is a Crown servant posted abroad.</p>

<p>If your partner and child join you in the UK you’ll need to let the <a href="/contact-the-tax-credit-office" title="Contact the Tax Credit Office">Tax Credit Office</a> know within a month. This is because your tax credits payments may change.</p>

<h2>Your partner gets benefits in another <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country or Switzerland</h2>
<p>If you’ve got children, and your partner gets benefits paid by another <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country or Switzerland, these may affect your tax credits. </p>

<p>Some benefits are counted as income, for example benefits paid because of unemployment, but others - like family benefits - aren’t. If your partner does get family benefits paid by another <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country, it may affect the amount of Child Tax Credit you’re paid.</p>


</article><article id="going-abroad-temporarily"><header><h1>Part 2: Going abroad</h1>
  </header><p>Your tax credits will stop if you expect to be away for 52 weeks or more.</p>

<p>You may still qualify for tax credits if you go abroad for a short period, for example on holiday or for medical treatment. </p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Reason for leaving</th>
      <th>How long you can get tax credits for</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Medical treatment for yourself, your partner or your child</td>
      <td>Up to 12 weeks</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Death of your partner, a child or close relative of either you or your partner</td>
      <td>Up to 12 weeks</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Any other reason - eg holidays or business</td>
      <td>Up to 8 weeks</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If your trip is going to last longer than 8 or 12 weeks, contact the <a href="/contact-the-tax-credit-office" title="Contact the Tax Credit Office">Tax Credit Office</a> within a month. Your tax credits will usually end, unless:</p>

<ul>
<li>you get UK benefits or State Pension and you live in another European country with a child</li>
  <li>you work and pay National Insurance contributions in the UK, but your family lives in another European country</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seafarers and offshore workers</h2>
<p>If you’re a seafarer or an offshore worker you’ll be able to continue to claim tax credits if you’re outside the UK. But each period that you work outside the UK must be 8 weeks or less.</p>

<p>You’ll be treated as being in the UK as long as you’re inside the UK’s territorial waters - 12 miles out from the low water mark. If you’re working outside this limit you can only be away from home for up to 8 weeks at a time before your tax credit award ends.</p>


</article><article id="you-live-outside-the-uk"><header><h1>Part 3: You live outside the UK</h1>
  </header><p>You could get tax credits if you’re a crown servant posted overseas or you live abroad with your child and get UK benefits or the State Pension.</p>

<h2>You’re a Crown servant posted overseas</h2>
<p>You may be able to claim tax credits, just as if you were living in the UK. The Tax Credit Office will treat you as being in the UK if any of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>you are, or were just before you were posted abroad, ‘ordinarily resident’ in the UK</li>
  <li>you’ve had a series of postings abroad, with no breaks in between - and you are or were ‘ordinarily resident’ in the UK immediately before the first of those postings</li>
  <li>you were in the UK just before you were posted abroad and the reason you were in the UK was connected to your posting - this can apply to a single posting or to a series of postings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ordinarily resident</h3>
<p>Ordinarily resident means you normally live in the UK, and plan to stay here for the time being. When the Tax Credit Office decides if you’re ordinarily resident in the UK they’ll look at things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>where your settled home is</li>
  <li>where your close family live</li>
  <li>why you came to the UK</li>
  <li>if you plan to leave the UK permanently in the next 2 or 3 years</li>
</ul>
<h2>If your partner’s a Crown servant posted overseas</h2>
<p>If your partner’s a Crown servant posted outside the UK, you may be able to claim tax credits if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>live with your partner while they work abroad</li>
  <li>live in the UK while your partner works abroad</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be ordinarily resident in the UK during the time you’re with your Crown servant partner overseas.</p>

<h2>You have a child - and get UK benefits or State Pension</h2>
<p>If none of the sections above apply to you, you might be able to claim Child Tax Credit if both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you and your child live in a European Union (EU) member state</li>
  <li>
    <p>you get State Pension or one of the following benefits:</p>

    <ul>
<li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
      <li>State Pension</li>
      <li>Widow’s Benefit</li>
      <li>Bereavement Benefit</li>
      <li>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit</li>
      <li>contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      <li>Severe Disablement Allowance</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t live in an EU member state, you won’t be able to get Child Tax Credit. An exception to this is if you (or your partner) are a Crown servant posted abroad. </p>


</article><article id="crossborder-workers"><header><h1>Part 4: Cross-border workers</h1>
  </header><p>You may be able to get tax credits if you regularly travel from:</p>

<ul>
<li>another country to work in the UK </li>
  <li>the UK to work in another country </li>
</ul>
<h2>Working Tax Credit</h2>
<p>You may be able to get <a href="/working-tax-credit" title="Working Tax Credit">Working Tax Credit</a> if you live in:</p>

<ul>
<li>an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country (including Switzerland) and work in the UK </li>
  <li>the UK and working in an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country (including Switzerland) </li>
</ul>
<h2>Child Tax Credit</h2>
<p>You and your partner - if you have one - can usually get <a href="/child-tax-credit" title="Child Tax Credit">Child Tax Credit</a> for your children if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you work in the UK</li>
  <li>you pay National Insurance as a worker here</li>
  <li>your child lives in an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country or in Switzerland </li>
  <li>your child is living with your partner or someone else and they depend on you to support them</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, you can’t claim Child Tax Credit for a child who lives outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland. </p>

<p>An exception to this is if you or your partner are a Crown servant posted abroad.</p>

<h2>Childcare costs</h2>
<p>You can usually claim <a href="/childcare-tax-credits" title="Childcare and tax credits">help for your childcare costs</a> through the childcare element of Working Tax Credit.</p>

<p>To qualify your children must either:</p>

<ul>
<li>be in <a href="/childcare-tax-credits/eligibility" title="Registered or approved childcare providers">registered or approved childcare in the UK</a>
</li>
  <li>be in childcare approved by a Ministry of Defence accreditation scheme abroad - if you’re a Crown servant posted abroad</li>
</ul></article><article id="immigration-control"><header><h1>Part 5: Immigration control</h1>
  </header><p>Usually, if you’re ‘subject to immigration control’ you can’t normally get tax credits although there are some exceptions. </p>

<p>When you arrived in the UK your passport may have been stamped. The stamp shows the conditions of your stay in the UK. For example, ‘no recourse to public funds’.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>You may get tax credits if your partner lives in the UK and is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>not subject to an immigration control</li>
  <li>subject to an immigration control but their circumstances are covered by one of the examples below</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll still need to meet the other qualifying rules - eg work the right number of hours. </p>

<h2>You’ve ‘no recourse to public funds’ and your money from overseas stops for a while</h2>

<p>You may get tax credits for up to 42 days if the money you normally get from overseas stops for a short while. But it must be likely that you’ll start getting your overseas money again soon, and you must still have permission to stay in the UK.</p>

<h2>You’ve permission to stay in the UK because someone else supports you</h2>

<p>You may still be able to get tax credits if someone else is responsible for your maintenance while you’re in the UK. This means that they pay for your upkeep and provide you with somewhere to live. This person is often called your ‘sponsor’, and could be a friend, employer or relative. </p>

<p>All of the following must apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>your sponsor has given the Home Office a written statement saying that they’re sponsoring you</li>
  <li>your sponsor has permission to stay in the UK</li>
  <li>you’ve been living permanently in the UK for at least 5 years, either since you came into the UK or since you started being sponsored (whichever date is later)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to get tax credits if you’ve been living in the UK for fewer than 5 years, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>your sponsor has died</li>
  <li>all your sponsors - if you had more than one - have died</li>
</ul>
