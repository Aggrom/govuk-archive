<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you export goods to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (known as âthird countriesâ), you must have the appropriate licences and make export declarations to customs through the National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>). You must also make sure that VAT, import taxes and duties in the destination country are paid where necessary, and follow transport procedures, though this is normally the responsibility of the importing person or company. There are a number of export procedures, such as duty relief schemes which can benefit businesses.</p>

<h2 id="vat-on-exports-and-other-taxes">VAT on exports and other taxes</h2>

<p>When a third country receives your goods, it may charge duty. A third country may also charge their own equivalent of VAT or purchase tax.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/exports/goods.htm">exports, despatches and supplying goods abroad: charging VAT.</a></p>

<h3 id="zero-rating-your-goods">Zero-rating your goods</h3>

<p>You can usually zero-rate goods you are exporting out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as long as you:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure they leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> within set time limits (typically three months)</li>
  <li>keep satisfactory evidence of their departure</li>
  <li>hold sufficient evidence from your accounting records to prove that a transaction has taken place</li>
  <li>keep official evidence of export - either the Goods Departure Message for goods leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> direct from the UK (direct exports) or, for goods leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via other member states (indirect exports), an Export Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr>). The <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> must be stamped by customs in the last member state where the goods exit the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> - the Office of Exit</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the VAT treatment will depend on whether youâre exporting the goods directly or indirectly, when you organise delivery and when your customer arranges collection.</p>

<h3 id="vat-returns-and-intrastat">VAT returns and Intrastat</h3>

<p>Every business trading within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has to declare its sales on its VAT return. In addition, if your sales of goods exceed the applicable threshold during a calendar year, you will also have to submit Intrastat returns each month. The amount of information required depends on the value of their Arrivals (purchases or imports) or Dispatches (sales or exports).</p>

<p>Intrastat thresholds are reviewed annually.Â The 2012 thresholds, which remain the same as 2011, are Â£600,000 for Arrivals and Â£250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>Businesses with Dispatches or Arrivals of goods below this threshold are only required to declare the value of Dispatches (sales or exports) to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states in box 8 and the value of Arrivals (purchases or imports) acquired from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states in box 9 on their standard VAT return.</p>

<p>Businesses with Dispatches to or Arrivals from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> above the Intrastat exemption threshold must also submit monthly Supplementary Declarations (SDs) to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Larger businesses trading above the 2012 Intrastat delivery terms threshold of Â£16 million - this remains the same as 2011 - must also specify delivery terms information on their SDs.</p>

<h3 id="common-agricultural-policy">Common Agricultural Policy</h3>

<p>For exports of agricultural goods and processed foods covered by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), you may be entitled to a refund or required to pay a levy. See the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087336726&amp;r.l3=1078171756&amp;topicId=1079819214">exporting CAP goods.</a> You may also have to apply for a licence to export certain goods above a defined quantity. <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/B56B89FF95E9D0F680256F72003D6051?Opendocument">Find information about agricultural exports on the Rural Payments Agency website.</a></p>

<h3 id="origin-rules">Origin Rules</h3>

<p>Even if your customer is responsible for paying duty on the goods in the destination third country, you need to provide the right documentation. Third countries may have import duty regimes in place, but in some countries your exports may qualify for a reduced rate of duty or be classed as duty free. Youâll need to provide evidence of the productâs origin to claim the benefit. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/rules-of-origin">rules of origin.</a></p>

<h3 id="the-tariff">The Tariff</h3>

<p>The Integrated Tariff of the UK (the Tariff) is the official <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> guide to importing and exporting taxes and duty. The TariffÂ contains the codes and customs requirements you need for import and export paperwork.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">online UK Trade Tariff tool</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Ultimately, third country duties are based on the type of goods youâre exporting, their origin and their value, all of which are subject to change in the destination countries. In addition to the Tariff, you can also check with UK Trade &amp; Investment or the destination country about what taxes are to be paid and whether the exporter or importer is obliged to pay them.</p>

<h2 id="export-licences-and-other-controls">Export licences and other controls</h2>

<p>Exports of some goods are controlled. You may need to apply for a licence, or comply with specific regulations.</p>

<p>Weapons and other goods and technologies with a potential military use may require an export licence from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>). If goods are to pass through more than one country, you are likely to need a licence for each transit country.</p>

<p>All military controlled items and some highly sensitive Dual-Use Goods need a licence, even if the export is made to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. Some may be subject to sanctions or embargoes with total or partial bans on exporting such goods to named third countries.</p>

<p>Less sensitive controlled dual-use goods exports need a licence if shipped outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Controls also apply to the brokering - which can include warehousing and shipping - and transport of dual-use goods.Â <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/dual-use-brokering.pdf">Download guidance on brokering dual-use goods from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (PDF, 168KB).</a> In addition, UK nationals who trade outside the UK in strategically controlled goods between overseas countries may need a trade control licence through the UK.</p>

<p>There are wider restrictions on exports to countries subject to sanctions. You can find guidance on sanctions, embargoes and restrictions and read about strategic export controls in the guide to theÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/about-the-export-control-organisation">Export Control Organisation.</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.co.uk/goodsChecker">Use the Goods Checker on the ECO Checker website (registration required).</a></p>
</div>

<p>Agricultural products and processed foods typically require a Common Agricultural Policy licence from the RPA. They may also be subject to a refund or a levy.Â <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/4CCBA8C61D82148080256F72003D614C?Opendocument">Find information about agricultural exports on the RPA website.</a></p>

<p>Exports of valuable antiques and works of art may need a licence from the Export Licensing Unit of theÂ Arts Council.Â Read about <a rel="external" href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-museums/cultural-property/export-controls/export-licensing/">export licensing for cultural goods on the Arts Council website.</a></p>

<p>Exports of dangerous chemicals outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> may need to be notified in advance to the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) and <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>.Â <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pic/exporters/index.htm">Read about prior informed consent for trade in dangerous chemicals on the HSE website.</a> Businesses that trade more than one tonne of chemicals a year must register with the new <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> chemical management agency REACH, based in Helsinki.Â Read a <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/timeline.htm">basic guide to REACH on the HSE website.</a></p>

<p>Live animals, meat and plants may need licensing and health inspection from various UK-based government agencies before your goods reach their destination.Â <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">Find information on animal and plant export regulations on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Other products subject to export controls or licensing requirements include medicinesÂ and controlled drugsÂ and the chemicals used in their manufacture, rough diamonds being exported out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, exported waste and certain species of fish, which may be subject to a ban or quota. Your trade association may be able to advise on export controls applying to your products.</p>

<p>See the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-and-import-licences-for-controlled-goods-and-trading-with-certain-countries">export and import licences for controlled goods.</a></p>

<h2 id="export-declarations">Export declarations</h2>

<p>When you transport goods out ofÂ the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with the intent to permanently export those goods, you must first submit an electronicÂ export declaration via the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>, part of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>âs Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system. Exceptionally, a paper export declaration known as a C88/ESS may be used for, for example, merchandise carried in hand baggage (<abbr title="Merchandise in Baggage">MIB</abbr>). Indirect exports (ie those moving from the UK but exiting in another member state must be accompanied byÂ an Export Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr>). This page explains what to do and, depending on the type of export, other procedures you may have to follow.</p>

<p>Youâre not generally required to complete an export declaration for goods being sold within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. There are exceptions, for exampleÂ sales to international organisations, which are treated as exports and exports to special <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> territories. For more information,Â <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;resetCT=true&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_008051">read a basic guide to trading abroad on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>When you export goods out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to third countries, you can usually zero-rate the goods for VAT purposes.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-make-the-declaration">How to make the declaration</h3>

<p>You will need to have an Economic Operator Registration Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration Identification">EORI</abbr>) number and register for <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>, which you can then access via:</p>

<ul>
<li>email - not to be used for CAP declarations</li>
  <li>a web form via the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</li>
  <li>XML</li>
  <li>Community System Provider (CSP) and software houses</li>
  <li>a paper declaration that <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> staff will input for you in exceptional circumstances</li>

<p>You can use an agent, for exampleÂ a freight forwarder, to make the declaration on your behalf. This can make exporting simpler and faster if youâre not authorised to make electronic declarations yourself.</p>

<p>The declaration allows <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to check that youâre complying with export controls, for exampleÂ licensing requirements, duty and VAT. </p>

<p>Traders must classify their goods as part of the declaration, including a commodity code and a Customs Procedure Code (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>). A <abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> identifies the nature of the movement of exports. It also describes the purpose of your shipment and informs <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> about the duty liabilities on the goods. Volume 2 of the Tariff contains a full list of commodity codes and volume 3 contains details of <abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr>. You must also provide a reference for the goods, known as a Unique Consignment Reference.</p>

<p>Incoterms - internationally recognised trading terms - clarify the obligations of exporter and customer as to who bears the costs of international transport and auxiliary services and responsibility for presenting documentation. For example, the Ex-Works Incoterm places minimal duties on the seller. See the guide onÂ International Commercial Contracts - Incoterms.</p>

<p>Safety and security regulations require you to pre-notify goods due to leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> within set time limits ahead of their departure. If you complete normal export declarations, you will be covered, but if youâre not declaring them in the usual way, you must complete an Exit Summary Declaration.Â <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/ecip/documents/procedures/annex_6_faq_en.pdf">Download FAQs on Exit Summary Declarations from the Europa website (PDF, 341KB).</a></p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>âs Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) scheme allows registered companies to take advantage of the simplified customs procedures that relate to the security and safety of their goods in transit. See the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/authorised-economic-operator-certification">Authorised Economic Operators.</a> Businesses will need to have an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration Identification">EORI</abbr> number before they register for the AEO scheme.

<p>If youâre taking commercial goodsÂ out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in your baggage, you must declare the goodsÂ electronically to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> or exceptionally you may complete a C88/ESS. You can have the declaration stamped by customs when you leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as proof of export to zero-rated goods for VAT, however submitting and clearing a paper export declaration at the port or airport will take longer than if the export declaration was submitted electronically to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.Â <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000264&amp;propertyType=document">Read about <abbr title="Merchandise in Baggage">MIB</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="international-road-transport">International Road Transport</h3>

<p>If you need to move goods through several countries, you may be able to use the Transports Internationaux Routiers (TIR) procedure to allow your goods to pass through borders with minimal customs intervention.</p>

<p>All traders moving goods across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> under the TIR procedure must also submit an electronic customs declaration using the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS).</p>

<h3 id="temporary-exports">Temporary exports</h3>

<p>If you want to temporarily export goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, for exampleÂ samples for an exhibition, you can do so by using a temporary export Customs Procedure Code (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>) in your declaration to <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>, or move the goods under an ATA Carnet.</p>

<p>The ATA carnet will simplify their export and temporary import into the third country destination. This type of carnet is valid in most major countries and will enable deferment of up to a year of import duties and that might otherwise have applied. See the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/ata-and-cpd-carnets-export-procedures">ATA and CPD carnets.</a></p>

<h3 id="declarations-for-exports-by-post">Declarations for exports by post</h3>

<p>If you export goods out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by post, you must complete and attach a CN22 customs declaration (for goods worth up to Â£270) or CN23 for goods of higher value. You will need to retain evidence of posting in order to zero-rate the goods for VAT purposes. See the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/importing-and-exporting-by-post">importing and exporting by post.</a></p>

<h2 id="moving-goods-through-the-eu-to-non-eu-countries-indirect-exports">Moving goods through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries (indirect exports)</h2>

<p>Indirect exports - the dispatch of goods via an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country or countries to a third country destination - require special procedures and paperwork. Indirect exports are controlled by the Export Control System (ECS) which is an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide system implemented in July 2009. Indirect exports (whether they are by air, sea or road) must be accompanied by an <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> which has a Movement Reference Number (<abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr>) and Barcode which can be scanned at the Office of Exit in the last member state before the goods exit the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The UK treatment of indirect exports generally depends on their final destination:</p>

<ul>
<li>If youâre exporting to a country outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must complete an export declaration - even though the goods are initially being sent through another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.Â </li>
  <li>Export controls and licensing requirements will depend on the final destination of the goods.</li>
  <li>Goods exported to a customer outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> can be zero-rated for VAT even if they initially travel through other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries. However, proof of the goods actual departure from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will be required.</li>
</ul>
<p>WhenÂ exporting outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must complete an export declaration, even if the goods are being sent through another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country first. Indirect exports must be âArrivedâ on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> before they leave the UK. âArrivalâ is the technical term by which goods are presented to Customs via an export declaration - once you have completed this stage, <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will give you permission to progress (also referred to as P2P)Â your shipment. Failure to comply can lead to trouble in other countries, and even the rejection and the returnÂ of your goods. Exporters must also print an <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> to travel with the goods to the Office of Exit.</p>

<p>Depending on their final destination, you may need to satisfy other regulations and obtain other export licences.Â Indirect exports can only be zero-rated for VAT if you can prove the goods have been exported. </p>

<p>In the UK the export declaration submitted electronically to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will include all the safety and security data required underÂ the ECS. It is therefore a âcombinedâ declaration, ie fiscal and ECS safety and security data are combined on the UK export declaration. In the UK you do not need to submit separate safety and security information to the ECS - <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will pass the relevant data to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> ECS system. Once your declaration has been accepted by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, a Movement Reference Number Number (<abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr>) will be issued.Â This can be used to track the movement across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to exit and must be âclosedâ on the ECS system by scanning the barcode relating to the <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> at the Office of Exit.Â For more information, see the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-declarations-and-the-national-export-system-export-procedures">export declarations and the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>.</a></p>

<p>The safety and security legislation that came into force in 2009 set minimum time limits for the lodgement of Export Declarations ahead of their departure as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>for âdeep seaâ containerised cargo, at least 24 hours before the goods are loaded</li>
  <li>for âshort seaâ containerised cargo, at least 2 hours before leaving the port</li>
  <li>for air traffic, at least 30 minutes before departure from an airport</li>
  <li>for rail and inland waters traffic, at least 2 hours before departure</li>
  <li>for road traffic, at least 1 hour before departure</li>
  <li>for supplies for ships and aircraft at least 15 minutes before departure</li>
</ul>
<p>If you supply an export declaration, you will be covered, but if youâre not declaring goods in the usual way, you must complete an Exit Summary Declaration.</p>

<h3 id="carnets-for-non-community-goods-moving-through-the-eu">Carnets for non-community goods moving through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The Transports Internationaux Routiers (TIR) procedure is used to move goods, essentially by road, between two countries party to the TIR Convention or between two points in a participating country as long as the movement passes through a third country. The payment of duties and other charges are suspended. For the purposes of TIR, the Community is regarded as a single territory. TIR is only permitted in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> when the movement either begins, ends or transits a third country.</p>

<p>Goods must be transported in approved vehicles or containers and be accompanied by a TIR Carnet. You, or your freight forwarder, must be authorised to use the TIR system and to purchase a TIR Carnet. The Carnet acts as the customs declaration for movement when outside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and as security for any taxes and duties to which the goods become liable.Â <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_009345&amp;propertyType=document">Find details of TIR and New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) and links to newsletters on Community/Common Transit and TIR on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>All traders moving goods across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> under the TIR procedure must submit an electronic customs declaration via the NCTS when the consignment reaches the frontier of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.Â You can also see the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/using-the-new-computerised-transit-system-to-move-goods-across-the-eu-and-efta-countries">using the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) to move goods across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and European Free Trade Association (<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr>) countries.</a></p>

<p>If goods originate from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, the Community Transit procedure can be used to move them within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If goods are moving to or through a <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> country, the Common Transit procedure should be used. See the guide onÂ <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/transit-and-other-suspensive-regimes">community transit procedures.</a></p>

<h2 id="duty-reliefs">Duty reliefs</h2>

<p>Traders can claim money back for, or delay payment of various customs duties and VAT for some exports outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.
