</article><article id="the-rent-a-room-scheme"><header><h1>Part 2: The Rent a Room Scheme</h1>
  </header><p>The Rent a Room Scheme lets you earn £4,250 per year tax-free from letting out furnished accommodation in your only or family home. You can let out a room or an entire floor. </p>

<p>You can choose whether or not to join the scheme.</p>

<p>If you’re <strong>not</strong> in the scheme, you’ll pay tax on your rental income after letting expenses like wear and tear, insurance and repairs.</p>

<p>If you <strong>are</strong> in the scheme, you’ll only pay tax on rental income you get over £4,250. </p>

<p>Rental income includes money you get for extra services you provide, like meals and laundry. You won’t be able to claim any expenses.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The £4,250 allowance may be halved if someone else in the property - like your partner - also receives income from letting.</p>
</div>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>You can opt in to the scheme at any time if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re a resident landlord, whether or not you own your home</li>
  <li>you run a bed and breakfast or a guest house</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t use the scheme for homes converted into separate flats.</p>

<h2>How to get the allowance</h2>
<p>You’ll get the tax exemption automatically if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you don’t normally receive a tax return, and</li>
  <li>the yearly amount you get in rent, plus income from extra services you provide, is below £4,250</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get more than £4,250, you should complete a tax return.</p>

<p>If you want to opt out, complete a tax return and declare the relevant lettings income and expenses on the property pages.</p>

</article><article id="your-lodgers-tenancy-type"><header><h1>Part 3: Your lodger's tenancy type</h1>
  </header><p>The way you share your home with a lodger affects what kind of tenancy they have. This in turn affects their rights and how you can end the tenancy. </p>

<h2>Your lodger is an excluded occupier</h2>

<p>Your lodger is likely to be an excluded occupier if:</p>

<ul>
<li>they live in your home</li>
  <li>you or a member of your family share a kitchen, bathroom or living room with them</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, you only have to give them reasonable notice to <a href="ending-a-letting" title="Ending a letting">end the letting</a> - and you won’t have to go to court to evict them.</p>

<h2>Your lodger has basic protection</h2>

<p>Your lodger is likely to be an occupier with basic protection if:</p>

<ul>
<li>they live in your home</li>
  <li>they don’t share any living space with you or your family</li>
</ul>
<p>If your lodger won’t leave when you ask them, you’ll need to get a court order to <a href="ending-a-letting" title="Ending a letting">evict them</a>. </p>

<p>The charity Shelter has advice on <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/private_tenancies/excluded_occupiers" title="Excluded tenancies: Shelter" rel="external">excluded occupiers</a> and <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/private_tenancies/occupiers_with_basic_protection" title="Non-excluded tenancies" rel="external">occupiers with basic protection.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>The length of the let</h2>
<p>A tenancy or a licence can be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>periodic - run indefinitely from one rent period to the next</li>
  <li>fixed term - last a set number of weeks, months or years</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t agree the length of a let, it will automatically become a periodic let. </p>

<p>Licences can be open-ended for informal arrangements, like allowing a friend to stay on an as-and-when basis.</p>

</article><article id="rent-bills-and-tax"><header><h1>Part 4: Rent, bills and tax</h1>
  </header><h2>Rent</h2>
<p>You can charge what you want for rent but should agree the amount with your tenant beforehand. You can also ask for a deposit and you can accept Housing Benefit for rent. </p>

<p>You must provide a rent book for tenants who pay weekly. </p>

<h2>Council Tax</h2>
<p>You will be responsible for <a href="/council-tax" title="Council Tax">Council Tax</a> and can include part of the cost in the rent you charge. You must tell your council if having a tenant means you’re no longer entitled to a single person discount.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure who should pay Council Tax, check with your <a href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=57&amp;LGIL=8&amp;ServiceName=Find%20out%20more%20about%20%20council%20tax" title="Find out more about  council tax" rel="external">local council.</a></p>

<h2>Utility bills</h2>
<p>If you pay the utility bills for the entire house, you can include a charge in the rent or install pre-paid meters. </p>

<p>You can only charge the amount you’ve paid for gas and electricity plus VAT or you could face civil proceedings. Read Ofgem’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Consumers/CI/Pages/Resaleofgasandelectricity.aspx" title="Ofgem’s rules on the resale of gas and electricity">rules on the resale of gas and electricity</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Income Tax</h2>
<p>Income Tax is payable on rental income you receive. </p>

<p>If you’re <strong>not</strong> in the Rent a Room scheme, you’ll be charged Income Tax on any rental income you get after business letting expenses. Examples of business expenses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>insurance</li>
  <li>maintenance </li>
  <li>repairs (but not improvements)</li>
  <li>utility bills</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in the <a href="the-rent-a-room-scheme" title="Rent a Room Scheme">Rent a Room Scheme</a>, you’ll pay Income Tax differently. </p>

<h2>Capital Gains Tax</h2>
<p>You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax when you sell your home if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you let out all or part of it</li>
  <li>you’ve taken in more than 1 tenant or lodger at a time</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you may be entitled to <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/property/sell-own-home.htm" title="Capital gains tax relief on your home">Private Residence Relief and Letting Relief.</a> </p>

<p>Contact your <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/locator/locator.jsp?type=1" title="Contact your local tax office">tax office</a> for further details.</p>

<h2>Deposits</h2>
<p>Resident landlords aren’t legally required to <a href="/tenancy-deposit-protection" title="Tenancy deposit protection">protect tenants’ deposit</a> with one of the government-approved schemes. </p>

<p>Your local council may guarantee rent for a potential tenant who can’t afford a deposit.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may have to pay other taxes if you run a bed and breakfast, or provide meals or cleaning services for guests. <a href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?raction=view&amp;fl0=__dsid%3A&amp;sm=0&amp;ha=34&amp;as=1&amp;sf=&amp;sp_scope=hmrc&amp;sc=hmrc&amp;nh=10&amp;sr=0&amp;cs=ISO-8859-1&amp;tx1=&amp;tx0=49612/" title="Contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs" rel="external">Contact <abbr title="Her Majesty's">HM</abbr> Revenue &amp; Customs</a> for more information.</p>

</article><article id="ending-a-letting"><header><h1>Part 5: Ending a letting</h1>
  </header><h2>How to end an excluded tenancy or licence</h2>

<p>If your lodger is an excluded occupier, you only need to give them ‘reasonable notice’ to quit. </p>

<p>Usually this means the length of the rental payment period – so if your lodger pays rent weekly, you need to give 1 week’s notice. The notice doesn’t have to be in writing.</p>

<p>You can then change the locks on your lodger’s rooms, even if they’ve left their belongings there. You must give their belongings back to them.</p>

<h2>How to end a non-excluded tenancy or licence</h2>

<p>If your lodger is an occupier with basic protection, you must serve them a written ‘notice to quit’. The notice period will depend on the tenancy or agreement, but is often at least 4 weeks.</p>

<p>If your lodger doesn’t leave, you’ll need to get a court order to <a href="/private-renting-evictions" title="Private renting: evictions">evict them</a>. </p>

<h2>Your lodger ending the tenancy</h2>

<p>Your lodger can end the tenancy by giving you notice. They can’t do this during the fixed term of the tenancy, unless there’s a break clause.</p>

<p>The amount of notice they need to give depends on the tenancy agreement, if there is one. Otherwise, it’s usually at least 4 weeks (if they pay weekly) or 1 month (if they pay monthly).</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You and your tenant can end a tenancy at any time if you both agree.</p>
</div>

<h2>Change of ownership</h2>
<p>If you stop living in your home, the tenants can still stay there, but their tenancy type may change to reflect that you no longer live there.</p>

<p>If you sell your home and the new owner plans to live in the property as a resident landlord, they must:</p>

<ul>
<li>give notice to a tenant within 28 days that they intend to live there</li>
  <li>move in within 6 months of the sale</li>
</ul>
<p>Until the new owner moves in, tenants will have more protection through tenancy laws, because during this time there’s no resident landlord. Their rights will depend on when they moved in. Find out about tenants’ rights in <a href="/private-renting-tenancy-agreements/your-landlord-wants-to-end-your-tenancy" title="Your landlord wants to end your tenancy">‘Private renting: tenancy agreements’</a>.</p>

<p>If you die, a tenancy will usually continue as though you were still resident, until someone else takes ownership.</p>

</article><article id="houses-in-multiple-occupation"><header><h1>Part 6: Houses in Multiple Occupation</h1>
  </header><p>If you let rooms to more than 2 people, your property may be classed as an <a href="/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation" title="Houses in Multiple Occupation">House in Multiple Occupation (<abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr>)</a>. </p>

<p>There are extra safety requirements and standards for <abbr title="Houses in Multiple Occupation">HMOs</abbr> and you’ll often need a licence.</p>
