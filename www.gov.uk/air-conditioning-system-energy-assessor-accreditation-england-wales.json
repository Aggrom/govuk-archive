This means that if you already have experience of inspecting air conditioning systems you must show - when applying to an accreditation scheme - how you meet the National Occupational Standards at either level 3 or level 4. You may need to take top-up training.\r\n\r\nOnce qualified you can apply for accreditation. \r\n\r\n##How to apply\r\n\r\nYou must register with a scheme that provides accreditation for air conditioning system energy assessors.\r\n\r\nAs an energy assessor you can only conduct inspections in areas covered by your current qualification and accreditation system, ie if you're qualified and accredited to carry out domestic energy assessments you must not carry out commercial energy assessment unless also qualified and accredited for this area.\r\n\r\nApproval of accreditation may be limited as to\u00a0the types of air conditioning systems you can inspect.\r\n\r\nTo become accredited, you'll have to:\r\n\r\n* show that you can carry out consistent and accurate energy assessments in an independent manner\r\n* show that you're a fit and proper person who is qualified (by education, training and experience) to carry out energy assessments\r\n* prepare air conditioning energy inspection reports (ACR)\u00a0using a standard format\r\n* follow your scheme's code of conduct\r\n* enter ACRs produced by you onto the relevant register if required to do so by the accreditation scheme of which you are a member\r\n\r\n##Further information\r\n\r\nMandatory lodgement of ACRs onto a central register came into force on 6 April 2012.\r\n\r\nWhen issuing an ACR, you must include a declaration of any personal or business relationship that you have with:\r\n\r\n* the person who commissioned the certificate, or\u00a0any person on whose behalf the certificate was commissioned - or any person who you believe may have a personal or business relationship with such a person\r\n* any person who you believe may have an interest in the building\r\n\r\nYou must carry out energy assessments with reasonable care and skill. You must make sure that any ACR that you issue - and the data which was used to calculate any asset rating and to produce the document - and a copy of the ACR is passed to the accreditation scheme of which you're a member. This must be done before you give the document to the person who requested it to be issued.\r\n\r\n*[ACSEA]: air conditioning system energy assessor \r\n*[DCLG]: Department for Communities and Local Government \r\n*[ACR]: air conditioning energy inspection reports ","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:11:49+00:00","licence":{"location_specific":false,"availability":["England","Wales"],"authorities":[{"name":"BESCA","slug":"besca","contact":null,"actions":{"apply":[{"url":"","introduction":"","description":"Energy Assessor Scheme for the Inspection of Air Conditioning Systems &mdash; Application for an Air Conditioning System Inspector","payment":"none"}],"renew":[{"url":"","introduction":"","description":"Energy Assessor Scheme for the Inspection of Air Conditioning Systems &mdash; Renewal of Air Conditioning System Inspector status","payment":"none"}],"change":[{"url":"","introduction":"","description":"Energy Assessor Scheme for the Inspection of Air Conditioning Systems &mdash; Notification of a change to your existing Air Conditioning System Inspector status","payment":"none"}]}},{"name":"CIBSE","slug":"cibse","contact":null,"actions":{"apply":[{"url":"","introduction":"","description":"Air Conditioning Inspector &mdash; Application for a Air Conditioning Inspector","payment":"none"}]}},{"name":"NAPIT","slug":"napit","contact":null,"actions":{"apply":[{"url":"","introduction":"","description":"Air Conditioning System Energy Assessor &mdash; Application for a Air Conditioning System Energy Assessor","payment":"none"}]}}]}}],["tags",[{"title":"Licences and licence applications","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business%2Flicences.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Applying for licences from your council for events and businesses","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Flicences","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/licences"},"parent":{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[]]],"parts":null}
