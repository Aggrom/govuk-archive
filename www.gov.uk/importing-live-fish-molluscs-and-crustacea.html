<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Before you can import live fish, molluscs and/or crustacea into the UK, you must be authorised as an aquaculture production business by the Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>).</p>

<p>All consignments of fish, molluscs and/or crustacea from outside the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) need to be accompanied by a health certificate. This is issued by the competent authority in the country of origin and confirms the health status of the fish, molluscs or crustacea in the consignment.</p>

<p>If you are importing fish, molluscs and/or crustacea from within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, your consignments only need to be accompanied by a health certificate if they include species that are susceptible to, or carriers of, an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> controlled disease. In both cases you need to notify the appropriate authority before your imports arrive. </p>

<p>This guide explains the authorisations and documentation you need in order to import live fish, molluscs and crustacea. It also gives guidance on what happens if errors occur, and the steps you must take when exporting.</p>

<h2 id="authorisation-and-documentation-for-live-fish-mollusc-and-crustacea-importers">Authorisation and documentation for live fish, mollusc and crustacea importers</h2>

<p>Anyone importing live fish, molluscs and crustacea into Great Britain needs to be authorised by the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>. This includes imports intended for:</p>

<ul>
<li>farming</li>
  <li>relaying</li>
  <li>‘put and take’ fisheries</li>
  <li>restocking</li>
  <li>open and closed ornamental facilities, including pets and purchases for own collection</li>
  <li>scientific research</li>
  <li>public aquaria and zoos</li>
  <li>spas and medical use (nibble fish)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hold fish, molluscs or crustacea on your own site, your application to be authorised may need to include a biosecurity measures plan. For guidance on biosecurity measures plans, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Book-Importer-BMP-v2.pdf">download biosecurity measures guidance for importers from the Aquatic Animal Health and Movements (<abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr>) website (PDF, 453KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Authorisation is free of charge and you can apply using form AAH2. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-AAH2.pdf">download <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> form AAH2 from the <abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr> website (PDF, 51KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="importing-live-fish-mollusc-and-crustacea-from-outside-the-eu">Importing live fish, mollusc and crustacea from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Countries that are not in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or a member of the European Free Trade Association (<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr>) are treated as ‘third countries’ for import purposes.</p>

<p>Imports of fish, molluscs and crustacea from third countries must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the competent authority in the country of origin. The authority must follow model documents issued by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and will often charge for the service.</p>

<p>Imports that arrive in Great Britain directly from a third country must go through a border inspection post (<abbr title="border inspection post">BIP</abbr>) where the health certificate is inspected by Animal Health (<abbr title="Animal Health">AH</abbr>). You will need to inform <abbr title="Animal Health">AH</abbr> about your import at least one clear working day in advance using a Common Veterinary Entry Document (<abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>). You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-CVED-Notification.pdf">download a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> notification form from the <abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr> website (PDF, 67KB)</a>. For details of the timescales to observe when using a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> and also for contact details of <abbr title="border inspection posts">BIPs</abbr> in Great Britain, <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-CVED-Timetable.pdf">download the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> timetable for notifications of intended imports from the <abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr> website (PDF, 35KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="importing-live-fish-molluscs-and-crustacea-from-within-the-eu">Importing live fish, molluscs and crustacea from within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Different rules apply for movements from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> member countries. Health certification is only required if the species being imported is either a vector of - or is susceptible to - an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> controlled disease. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/Fish-Shellfish/FHI/importexport/vectorspecies">read a list of controlled diseases, and vector and susceptible species on the Scottish Government website</a>.</p>

<p>You must also notify the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> of all movements of fish, molluscs or crustacea into Great Britain from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> member countries using form AAH1, except tropical species for ornamental use. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-AAH1.pdf">Download <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> form AAH1 from the <abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr> website (PDF, 265KB)</a>.</p>

<p>However, although the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey are all part of the UK, they are recognised as separate ‘health zones’ to Great Britain. This means that movements from these areas must be accompanied by any necessary health certificates.</p>

<h3 id="fish-and-shellfish-intended-for-human-consumption">Fish and shellfish intended for human consumption</h3>

<p>If you import live or dead fish and shellfish for immediate human consumption or immediate processing for human consumption, your business doesn’t need to be authorised. But if your imports are from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, they will require health and hygiene certification. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports/want_to_import/fisheryproducts/%20">find out about importing fish and shellfish for human consumption on the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="additional-import-requirements-and-post-import-controls">Additional import requirements and post import controls</h2>

<p>In addition to general import requirements, there are other controls that may be required when importing endangered and non-native species. And there are also controls when you introduce species to UK waters or export them.</p>

<h3 id="endangered-species">Endangered species</h3>

<p>There are some species that are recognised world-wide as being endangered. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (<abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr>) is an international agreement designed to control the import, export and commercial use of these species. If you want to import any species that are on the <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> list you will need a <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> permit. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalhealth/CITES/">find out about <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="additional-controls">Additional controls</h3>

<p>Imports of certain species into the UK are controlled by additional licensing regimes. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>non-native crayfish - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/non-native-crayfish-and-lobster-deposits">non-native crayfish and lobster deposits</a> </li>
  <li>non-native fish - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/non-native-fish">non-native fish</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="movement-controls">Movement controls</h3>

<p>For all introductions of fish or shellfish into open waters in the UK, you must get ‘Section 30’ consent. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-fish-and-shellfish">moving fish and shellfish</a>.</p>

<p>If you are planning on exporting fish from the UK, there are certain steps you need to take. These depend on whether you are exporting to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state or to a country outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. </p>

<h2 id="when-importing-errors-occur">When importing errors occur</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a mistake can occur with the legal process of importing live fish, molluscs or crustacea into Great Britain. While the consignment is at a border inspection post an error with the consignment or the accompanying documentation may be identified. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>some or all of the documentation may become lost in transit</li>
  <li>errors may occur in the quantity of animals in the consignment</li>
  <li>errors might happen in the accompanying health certificate</li>
  <li>the health certificate may be incomplete</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-a-regulation-23">What is a Regulation 23?</h3>

<p>A ‘Regulation 23’ is the name given to a notice issued under Regulation 23(1) of the Animal and Animal Products (Import and Export) Regulations 2006. A Regulation 23 allows animals, including fish, molluscs or crustacea, to enter Great Britain even though there has been an error with the import process. It will be issued to prevent a consignment of animals being destroyed, as long as they can be isolated well enough to pose a low health risk to Great Britain.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-a-regulation-23-issued-to">Who is a Regulation 23 issued to?</h3>

<p>A Regulation 23 is served on the importer of the consignment. This is because they are the person who appears to be in charge of the animals at the time of the importation and when the veterinary checks were made. As an importer, it is your responsibility to make sure that all the terms of the Regulation 23 are complied with.</p>

<h3 id="isolation-of-the-consignment">Isolation of the consignment</h3>

<p>Before the Regulation 23 is served, as an importer you will be consulted about where the consignment can be isolated to. This may be a facility run by you or a site operated by a third party.</p>

<p>All isolation sites must have been approved by the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> and must be totally physically separate. They must have separate equipment and procedures, and the stock must remain in the facility until the Regulation 23 has been released.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility as the importer to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>any third parties involved are aware of the terms of Regulation 23</li>
  <li>the animals are isolated to prevent the introduction or spread of disease</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-and-when-is-a-regulation-23-released">How and when is a Regulation 23 released?</h3>

<p>Before a Regulation 23 can be released, you must resolve the problem that led to the Regulation 23 being issued.</p>

<p>If there is an error with the health certificate, you must arrange for the certificate to be amended or replaced by the competent authority in the country of origin.</p>

<p>If problems with the documentation can’t be resolved, the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> may sample and test the consignment for disease. This involves the sacrifice of a minimum of 30 animals and a delay of between two and three weeks.</p>

<h3 id="if-the-species-are-non-susceptible-tropical-species">If the species are non-susceptible tropical species</h3>

<p>If the species involved aren’t a vector of - or susceptible to - a controlled disease, a Regulation 23 won’t be issued for documentation errors. Instead, the consignment will be issued with a warning letter requiring the importer to correct paperwork errors but not requiring the animals to be isolated.</p>

<h2 id="newly-listed-exotic-diseases">Newly listed exotic diseases</h2>

<p>In October 2006, Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome (<abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr>) was added to the list of European Community exotic diseases. A transitional period, ending 31 December 2012, was allowed so that the disease could be monitored and tested and controls for <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr> could be implemented around the world.</p>

<h3 id="species-affected-by-eus">Species affected by <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>As with other fish diseases, there are species that are susceptible to <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr> and those that are carriers of it - ‘vector’ species.</p>

<p>Susceptible species are:</p>

<ul>
<li>gibelion, catla</li>
  <li>snakeheads</li>
  <li>multiple species of labeo</li>
  <li>tyre track eels</li>
  <li>mullets</li>
  <li>barbs</li>
  <li>gouramis</li>
</ul>
<p>Vector species are:</p>

<ul>
<li>goldfish</li>
  <li>crucian carp</li>
  <li>common carp</li>

<h3 id="importing-species-affected-by-eus">Importing species affected by <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2013, if you import susceptible and vector species into Great Britain, they must be accompanied by the correct health certificate declaring them to be free from <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you import species from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you need to confirm with your suppliers that they can obtain the correct health certification from their competent authority declaring the species free from <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr>. If they aren’t able to, you should not use those suppliers to import these species of fish and shellfish.</p>

<h3 id="what-health-certification-is-required">What health certification is required?</h3>

<p>Species affected by <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr> are imported under two different types of certificates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open certificates are used for fish intended for farming, relaying, ‘put and take’ fisheries and open ornamental facilities. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-Coldwater-Cert.pdf">Download a <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> example of an open certificate from <abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr> website (PDF, 2.02MB)</a>.</li>
  <li>Closed certificates are used for ornamental fish intended for closed ornamental facilities. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-Tropical-Cert.pdf">Download an <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> example of a closed certificate from the <abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr> website (PDF, 1.3MB)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the susceptible species are tropical species and can be imported on either an open or closed certificate, depending on their intended use. In both cases a <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr> declaration must be made at paragraph II.2 for susceptible species.</p>

<p>All of the vector species are coldwater species and can only be imported to sites in Great Britain under an open certificate. The <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr> declaration must be made at paragraph II.3 for vector species.</p>

<p>A mixed consignment of susceptible and vector species should be imported under an open certificate, with both paragraphs II.2 and II.3 completed for <abbr title="Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome">EUS</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="exporting-fish-molluscs-and-crustacea-from-great-britain">Exporting fish, molluscs and crustacea from Great Britain</h2>

<p>Exports of live fish, molluscs and crustacea from Great Britain often require health certification. The steps you need to take depend on whether you are exporting to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> member states or to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-to-eu-and-efta-countries">Exporting to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>When you export to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> member states, your consignments only need to be accompanied by health certificates if the species you are exporting are susceptible to - or vectors of - <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> controlled diseases. If they are, you will need to get the consignment inspected by the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> before the health certificate is issued. This is carried out free of charge but you do need to provide five working days notice to the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-to-countries-outside-the-eu">Exporting to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The requirements for exporting to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are set by the competent authority in the country of destination. It is your responsibility as the exporter to find out what the requirements are and to obtain copies of all necessary health certificates - including translations - that must accompany your consignments. You must also clarify who is an acceptable signatory: a qualified veterinarian or fish health specialist, for example. You must provide these certificates to the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> and ensure they are accurate and will be accepted by the destination country’s competent authority.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will then decide if your aquaculture production business site can meet the requirements. If they decide that it can’t, they will contact you to discuss the matter further and outline the options available. If your site can’t meet the requirements, you may decide to contact the competent authority to ask them to revise their requirements.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> signature is required, and possible, the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will arrange a visit, as well as discussing charges and issuing with you before they proceed.</p>
