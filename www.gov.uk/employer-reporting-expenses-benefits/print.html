  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re an employer and provide expenses or benefits to employees or directors, you might need to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and pay tax and National Insurance on them. </p>

<p>Examples of expenses and benefits include:</p>

<ul>
<li>company cars</li>
  <li>health insurance</li>
  <li>travel and entertainment expenses</li>
  <li>childcare</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are different rules for what you have to report and pay depending on the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-a-to-z" title="Expenses and benefits A to Z">type of expense or benefit</a> that you provide.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="reporting-and-paying"><header><h1>Part 2: Reporting and paying</h1>
  </header><p>At the end of the tax year you’ll need to submit an end-of-year form to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> for each employee you’ve provided with expenses or benefits. This will either be a P9D or P11D form, depending on the employee’s earnings ‘<a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="'at a rate'">at a rate</a>’.</p>

<p>You might also need to submit form P11D(b) to report the amount of Class 1A National Insurance due on all the expenses and benefits you’ve provided. You should do this if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve submitted more than one P11D form</li>
  <li>you’ve been sent a P11D(b) form by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to report</h2>

<p>Each expense or benefit is calculated differently. Find the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-a-to-z" title="Expenses and benefits A to Z">type of expense or benefit</a> you’ve provided to see what you’ll need to report and pay.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>For ‘minor’ expenses or benefits, you might be able to make a one-off payment at the end of the tax year, known as a <a href="/paye-settlement-agreements" title="PAYE Settlement Agreements"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to report</h2>

<p>The easiest way to fill in your end-of year forms is electronically, as many of the calculations are done for you. You can use any of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>commercial payroll software</li>
  <li>‘Online Return and Forms - <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>’ service (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>‘Basic <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Tools’ (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out more about <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/intro/payroll-system.htm" title="choosing a payroll system">choosing a payroll system.</a></p>

<h2>Correcting errors on forms</h2>

<p>If you notice you’ve made an error on a P9D or P11D form after you’ve submitted it, <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/contactus/view.page?record=yg7jCcYewik" title="Contact HMRC">contact <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr></a> - they will probably tell you to submit a new paper version of the form.</p>

<p>If you need to amend form P11D(b) after you’ve paid your Class 1A National Insurance, you should submit a new form, and also submit new versions of any affected P11D forms.</p>

</article><article id="record-keeping"><header><h1>Part 4: Record keeping</h1>
  </header><p>You must keep a record of all expenses and benefits you provide to your employees.</p>

<p>Your records need to show that you’ve reported accurately and your end-of-year forms are correct. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may ask to see evidence of how you accounted for each expense or benefit at the end of the tax year.</p>
</div>

<h2>What you should keep</h2>

<p>You’ll need to keep a record of: </p>

<ul>
<li>the date and details of every expense or benefit you provide</li>
  <li>any information needed to work out the reportable value you put on your end-of-year forms</li>
  <li>any payment your employee contributes to an expense or benefit</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also keep any correspondence you have with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Records must be kept for 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You reimburse an employee’s travel expenses – you’ll need to keep a record of when and why the employee travelled, and where possible keep receipts as evidence.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="calculate-earnings-at-a-rate"><header><h1>Part 5: Calculate earnings 'at a rate'</h1>
  </header><p>When reporting expenses and benefits, you’ll need to work out your employee’s earnings ‘at a rate’. This will affect which end-of-year form you submit.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Take your employee’s earnings for the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the value of any expenses or benefits you’ve given them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out the total pro rata - this is ‘at a rate’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Your employee works only half the week and earns £5,000 a year. You also pay them £1,000 a year towards travel. </p>

<p>So they earn ‘at a rate’ of £12,000 a year:  £5000 + £1,000 multiplied by 2 (because they only work half the week) = £12,000.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="dispensations"><header><h1>Part 6: Dispensations</h1>
  </header><p>Some expenses and benefits are eligible for a dispensation, meaning you won’t have to report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Dispensations can cover routine business expenses and benefits like:</p>

<ul>
<li>travel</li>
  <li>phone bills</li>
  <li>business entertainment expenses</li>
  <li>company car fuel</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-a-to-z" title="Expenses and benefits A to Z">type of expense or benefit</a> you’ve provided to see whether you can apply for a dispensation so you won’t have to report it.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no time limit on dispensations, but <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> reviews them regularly to make sure that they still apply.</p>
</div>

<h2>Checking expenses</h2>

<p>You can only apply for a dispensation if you have a system in place to check expense claims. </p>

<p>Your employees aren’t allowed to check their own expenses, so someone else within your company needs to do this to make sure that they are legitimate claims.</p>

<p>If this isn’t possible, you’ll need to prove that your claims are covered by the dispensation. In most cases receipts will be enough, but you may be asked for more evidence if your receipts don’t include enough information.</p>
