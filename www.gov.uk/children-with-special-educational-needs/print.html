  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><h2>What special educational needs are</h2>

<p>Some children have needs or disabilities that affect their ability to learn. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>behavioural/social (eg difficulty making friends)</li>
  <li>reading and writing (eg dyslexia)</li>
  <li>understanding things</li>
  <li>concentrating (eg Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
  <li>physical needs or impairments</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who to talk to if your child has special educational needs</h2>

<p>If you think your child may have special educational needs, contact the person in your child’s school or nursery responsible for special educational needs. </p>

<p>This person is called the ‘<abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> coordinator’, or ‘<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Coordinator">SENCO</abbr>’. If your child isn’t in a school or nursery, contact the local council or your doctor.</p>

<p>Contact your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.parentpartnership.org.uk/find-your-pps" title="find your local Parent Partnership Service">Parent Partnership Service</a> for impartial advice about special educational needs.</p>


</article><article id="types-of-support"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of support</h1>
  </header><p>There are stages of support to try and help children with special education needs. </p>

<p>If your child is getting the help they need and they’re learning well, there’s no need for them to go on to the next stage. </p>

<p>If your child has high needs, they won’t need to go through earlier stages of support and can get an assessment straight away. The stages are:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Early Years Action/School Action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early Years Action Plus/School Action Plus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statement of special educational needs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Early Years Action/School Action</h2>

<p>Your child’s teachers or <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Coordinator">SENCO</abbr> will discuss your child’s needs with you and decide what help to give. You should be asked about the help your child is given and its results.</p>

<p>This could mean a different way of teaching certain things, or some help from an extra adult.</p>

<h2>Early Years Action Plus/School Action Plus</h2>

<p>This is extra help from an external specialist, eg a speech therapist.</p>

<h2>Assessments</h2>

<p>An <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs/assessments" title="assessment of special educational needs">assessment of special educational needs</a> is carried out by the local council. Experts and people involved in your child’s education will be asked about your child’s needs and what should be done to meet them.</p>

<h2>Statement</h2>

<p>A <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs/statements" title="statement of special educational needs">statement of special educational needs</a> describes your child’s needs and how they should be met, including what school they should go to.</p>

<h2>Further education</h2>

<p>If your child has a statement of special educational needs, he or she will have a ‘transition plan’ drawn up in Year 9. This helps to plan for their future after leaving school. </p>

<p>Your local authority will make sure that your child gets the support they need and will work with social services before your child leaves school. </p>

<p>If your child needs to go to a specialist residential college after leaving school, the Education Funding Agency has a duty to fund their place.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The transition plan gets reviewed each school year.</p>

</article><article id="assessments"><header><h1>Part 3: Assessments</h1>
  </header><p>Either you or your child’s nursery or school can <a href="/apply-special-educational-needs-assessment" title="Apply for an assessment of special educational needs">ask for an assessment</a> from the council. They will get back to you within 6 weeks to say if they’ll do an assessment. </p>

<p>If your child is under 2, the council can refuse. If the child is over 2, you can appeal.</p>

<p>If your child is over 2, there are rules and time limits for assessments. If your child is under 2, the council decides how to do it.</p>

<p>These people will be involved in an assessment:</p>

<ul>
<li>you</li>
  <li>your child’s school/nursery</li>
  <li>educational psychologist</li>
  <li>doctor</li>
  <li>social services (will only give advice if they know your child)</li>
  <li>anyone else the council thinks it should ask</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go to any interview or test that happens during the assessment. You can also suggest other people the council should talk to, eg voluntary organisations or charities.</p>

<p>After an assessment you might get a <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs/statements" title="statement of special educational needs">‘statement of special educational needs’.</a></p>


</article><article id="statements"><header><h1>Part 4: Statements</h1>
  </header><p>Statements of special educational needs say what your child’s needs are. They are reviewed every year. </p>

<p>You must be consulted before a statement can be changed by the council. </p>

<p>If you disagree with a change, you can appeal to the <a href="/special-educational-needs-disability-tribunal/overview" title="special educational needs and disability tribunal">special educational needs and disability tribunal</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your local council should tell you if you’re going to get a statement within 12 weeks of starting the <a href="/children-with-special-educational-needs/assessments" title="assessment">assessment.</a></p>
</div>

<p>If the council decides not to write a statement, it will explain why and tell you how your child’s needs will be met inside or outside school.</p>

<p>If you disagree with a statement of special educational needs you can <a href="/special-educational-needs-disability-tribunal/overview" title="appeal to the tribunal">appeal to the tribunal</a>.</p>

<h2>Choosing a school</h2>

<p>The statement initially has a blank section for you to say what school you want your child to go to (either mainstream or special), or how you want them to be educated out of school.</p>

<p>You have 15 days to say what school (including <a href="/types-of-school/private-schools" title="Private schools">private schools</a>) you want your child to go to.</p>

<p>Your local council must agree to send your child to the school you want as long as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the school you choose is suitable for your child’s age, ability, skills and needs</li>
  <li>your child meets any academic selection criteria the school has (although most state schools do not select pupils by academic ability)</li>
  <li>your child’s presence will not have a negative impact on the education of other children already at the school</li>
  <li>putting your child in the school will be an efficient use of the local authority’s resources</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s a suitable state school, the local council doesn’t have to send your child to a private school.</p>

<h3>Changing schools</h3>

<p>You can also ask the local council to change the school named in your child’s statement, if it’s at least 12 months since you asked for a change or since the statement was made or changed. This can only be the same type of school, eg mainstream school or special school.</p>
