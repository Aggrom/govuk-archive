Your employer must be able to show there is a good reason to - this is called \u2018objective justification\u2019.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**  \r\nIf you have a 3-month contract and a permanent employee doing the same kind of job has a company car, it may not be fair to expect your employer to offer you a company car for such a short period.\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##If you think you're not being treated fairly\r\nIf you have a concern, try and sort it out with your manager. You can ask your employer for a written statement explaining why they're treating you less favourably.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not satisfied, you can complain using your employer's [grievance procedure](/solve-workplace-dispute \"Solve a workplace dispute\").\r\n\r\nYou final option is to make a claim to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals \"Employment tribunal\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"fixedterm-contract-rights","title":"Fixed-term contract rights"}},{"table":{"body":"##Ending a fixed-term contact\r\nYour fixed-term contract will normally end automatically when it reaches the agreed end date. Your employer doesn't have to give you notice.\r\n\r\n##If your contract is not renewed\r\n\r\nIf your fixed-term contact isn't renewed, it's considered to be a dismissal. In this situation your employer needs to show that there's a 'fair' reason for not renewing your contract, eg they're planning to stop doing the work you were employed to do.  \r\n\r\nYou've the right:\r\n\r\n- not to be unfairly dismissed after 2 years' service (for employees who were in employment before 6 April 2012, it's 1 year's service)  \r\n- to a written statement of reasons for not renewing the contract - after 1 year\u2019s service\r\n\r\nYou may be entitled to statutory redundancy payments after 2 years' service if your work ends unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n##If your employer wants to end your contract earlier\r\nIf your employer wants to end your fixed-term contract early, you should check the terms of your contract. If: \r\n\r\n- it says nothing about being ended early, your employer may be in breach of contract\r\n- it says it can be ended early, and your employer has given proper notice, there's little you can do  \r\n\r\nThe minimum notice period you're entitled to is:\r\n\r\n- after 1 month\u2019s continuous service, but less than 2 years - 1 week\r\n- after 2 years' continuous employment - 1 week for each year you've worked \r\n\r\n^These are the minimum periods - your contract may give you the right to a longer notice period.^\r\n\r\nIf your employer ends your contract without giving you the proper notice, you may be able to claim [breach of contract](/dismissal \"Dismissal\").\r\n\r\n##Working longer than the contract's end date\r\nIf you work past the end of your contract without it being formally renewed, there's an 'implied agreement' by your employer that the end date has changed.\r\n\r\nYou would then have the right to be given proper notice if your employer wanted to dismiss you.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**  \r\nIf your contract was for 1 month or less but you were actually employed for 3 months, you'd be entitled to the minimum notice period (1 week).\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##The limit on renewing a fixed-term contract\r\nYou can be kept on successive fixed-term contracts for limit of 4 years.\r\n\r\nIf it's renewed after that, you'll become a permanent employee unless your employer can show a good reason why you should stay on a fixed-term contract.\r\n\r\nYou can work for longer than 4 years on fixed-term contracts if it has been agreed by both the employer and employees agreeing a workforce or 'collective agreement'.\r\n\r\n##Your employer wants to renew a fixed-term contract on less favourable terms\r\n\r\nIf you employer wants to renew your fixed-term contract on less favourable terms you can negotiate with them to reach an agreement. \r\n\r\nIf the contract ends and you have been unable to agree to the less favourable terms of a new contract, you may be able to claim [unfair dismissal](/dismissal \"Dismissal\").\r\n\r\n##Ending your contract early\r\nYou must give 1 week\u2019s notice if you've worked for your employer for a month or more.
