<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The main customs form used in international trade is known as the Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) - also known as form C88 in the UK. Traders and agents can use the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> to assist with declaring import, export, transit and community status declarations in manual processing situations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> was introduced to control goods arriving from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and goods being exported outside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For trade within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> single market the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> is not necessary. The <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> also covers the movement of non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> goods within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> is harmonised in line with other European versions of the form and is largely restricted to instances when computer systems are not working and customs resort to manual processing, or as an advice to shipping agents.</p>

<p><abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> box numbers refer to the electronic system field numbers respectively.</p>

<p>New security legislation requires advanced information for goods arriving in or leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. If you supply a <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> with your goods you will be able to meet many of these security requirements. You will need an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number to complete an Entry Summary Declaration or an Exit Summary Declaration.</p>

<p>For imports or arrivals, see Import Control System</p>

<p>For exports see <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/ecip/documents/procedures/export_exit_guidelines_en.pdf">security declarations on export and exit provisions (PDF, 129K)</a></p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-the-single-administrative-document-in-international-trade">The role of the Single Administrative Document in international trade</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>, which is recognised internationally by customs, can be used by traders in the UK to fulfil customs and duty obligations to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. When you make a declaration to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> many of the boxes on the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> that you fill out contain information from other commercial paperwork, such as invoices, packing lists, certificates and shipping documents.</p>

<p>A completed <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> must detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>what the goods are</li>
  <li>the movement of the goods</li>
  <li>the goods’ commodity code - also called Tariff heading, Tariff code, classification code or harmonisation code</li>
  <li>the customs procedure code (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>) - which determines how customs treat your entry - see exporting goods to a third country outside the EU</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> breaks down into 54 boxes and the full version comes in eight parts for use at different points in the trading process. Parts 2 and 3 are for export, parts 6, 7 and 8 are for import, and parts 1, 4 and 5 are for transit. Traders should use Volume 3 of the Tariff to complete the required boxes.</p>

<p>Most traders now submit their <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> online although when systems are down it can still be submitted on paper. You can buy software from freight software suppliers that is designed to simplify submitting electronic declarations. As changes to the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> are often given through software updates the software you use to connect to the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system may require amending or updating - your freight software supplier should ensure <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> information is updated and compatible.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-single-administrative-document-for-imports-and-exports">Using the Single Administrative Document for imports and exports</h2>

<p>Traders moving goods between European countries don’t need to complete a <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>. They may complete the form for trade with third countries, as well as to move non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> goods within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. In certain circumstances goods may move within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> under special <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> arrangements.</p>

<h3 id="making-an-import-declaration">Making an import declaration</h3>

<p>You must declare imports of third country goods into the UK by using the information captured on the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> and sending it electronically to the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system. You can complete details on the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> and arrange for an agent to act for you. </p>

<p>If you or your agent has approved access the data can be inputted direct to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system.</p>

<p>For goods that are liable for duty a full declaration to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> or a paper <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> declaration is required.</p>

<p>For duty free goods you can use a copy of an approved standard commercial document, such as a commercial invoice or a partly completed <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can use the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> to declare your imported goods to customs procedures with economic impact such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inward Processing (<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>) or Outward Processing Relief (<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>) - see the guide to Inward Processing</li>
  <li>end use - see the guide to end-use relief</li>
  <li>customs warehousing - see the guide to customs warehousing using a Customs Procedure Code in the 71 series on the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="special-circumstances-for-submitting-a-manual-sad">Special circumstances for submitting a manual <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you’re carrying merchandise in your own baggage (<abbr title="Merchandise in your own Baggage">MIB</abbr>), such as goods or samples, you must complete a <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> if your goods are worth more than £867. Enter AI statement code ‘MIB01’ at header level in the specified field of box 44. If your <abbr title="Merchandise in your own Baggage">MIB</abbr> exports are valued at less than £867, weigh less than 1,000 kilograms, do not need an export licence, and are not subject to export duty, you can use the <abbr title="Merchandise in your own Baggage">MIB</abbr> low-value goods procedure and supply your commercial invoice or make an electronic declaration instead. You must also complete an <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> for <abbr title="Merchandise in your own Baggage">MIB</abbr> goods if you are entering the goods into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>, <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> or end use.</p>

<h3 id="trade-imports-by-post">Trade imports by post</h3>

<p>If you are importing goods by post and claiming duty relief using schemes such as temporary admission, customs warehousing, returned goods relief and processing under customs control or end-use relief, you must complete a full import <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> if your potential duty liability exceeds €10.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> based declaration is normally necessary on consignments with a value over £2,000.</p>

<p>The sender must complete a Customs CN23 for goods worth over £270. This should be attached to the posted package. When the goods arrive you will be sent a C87 ‘Notice of Arrival of Goods by Post’. It contains the customs reference number for the package. This informs you that your goods have arrived in the UK but cannot be delivered until you have completed and returned the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="making-an-export-declaration">Making an export declaration</h3>

<p>For goods moving to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you must use <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> based information to create an export declaration. You must complete it electronically through the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> based National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>). You can find out about electronic declarations to customs in the guide UK’s import and export processing system CHIEF</p>

<p>Clearance through the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> is faster and more efficient than the previous manual <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> procedure and there are clear advantages when capturing proof of export and making a VAT zero rating claim to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="special-circumstances-for-export-sads">Special circumstances for export SADs</h3>

<p>For Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) goods the standard <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> export procedures apply. When systems are down the completed <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> C88 (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) CIE form must be used as additional information is required for <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> export declarations.</p>

<p>SADs can also be used for <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries - Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein - and for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s special fiscal territories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finland’s Aland Islands</li>
  <li>Spain’s Canary Islands</li>
  <li>the UK’s Channel Islands</li>
  <li>the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe</li>
  <li>French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion</li>
  <li>Mount Athos in Greece</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there’s a special procedure for trading goods directly between the Channel Islands and the UK. You can find out more about the special conditions which apply to trade between the UK and the Channel Islands. Traders who wish to use <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> for dispatches to the Channel Islands can do so. You can find out about <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> in the guide to export declarations and the National Export System</p>

<p>Passengers carrying <abbr title="Merchandise in your own Baggage">MIB</abbr> such as commercial goods and samples must list the goods on a <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> and declare them in the UK if they want to reclaim VAT. For <abbr title="Merchandise in your own Baggage">MIB</abbr> declarations traders must enter AI statement code ‘MIB01’ at header level in the specified field of box 44 on the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<p>For exports by post international customs declarations are only generally required on goods up to £2,000, although there are exceptions.</p>

<p>There’s a low-value procedure for goods that:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a total value of less than £867</li>
  <li>weigh less than 1,000 kilograms</li>
  <li>aren’t liable for duty</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000260&amp;propertyType=document#P140_13005">find out about the low-value goods procedure on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>The above list refers to the low value goods procedure only. You should consult Volume 1, Part 10 of the Tariff or the paper copy of the Tariff for additional information.</p>

<p>A declaration can either be made electronically through <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> as a <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> low-value declaration, a partly completed copy 2 of the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>, or an approved commercial document.</p>

<h3 id="email-declarations">Email declarations</h3>

<p>When systems are down traders are able to submit <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> declarations by fax or by email to the National Clearance Hub (<abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>). The email addresses are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:NCH@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk"><abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:NHCLAP@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">NHCLAP@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Traders should not mix fax and email declarations with the same reference numbers.</p>

<h2 id="single-administrative-document-duty-and-transit-codes">Single Administrative Document duty and transit codes</h2>

<p>When completing the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> there are two key boxes which determine the customs duties that you are liable to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the commodity code (also referred to as the Tariff classification, combined nomenclature number, TARIC number or harmonised system number)</li>
  <li>the customs procedure code (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on these codes see the guide on classification of goods</p>

<p>The commodity code (box 33) is an eight digit number (for most exports), or a ten-digit number (for most imports) that classifies goods to a coded reference. Codes can be found in the Tariff (Volume 2). If you’re unable to classify your goods you can contact the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Tariff Classification Service enquiry line on 01702 366 077 who can issue a Binding Tariff Information decision for you, confirming the correct code to use.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> (box 37) identifies customs procedure codes. Procedure codes are made up of two pairs of numbers and a three digit coded reference. The first pair of numbers covers the procedure being applied for and the second set covers any previous customs procedure. The last three digits clarify the actual procedure being applied for.</p>

<p>CPCs cover routine imports and exports, goods being imported or exported on a temporary basis and also goods brought in for processing which are later re-exported. There are other codes which cover goods placed into a Customs warehouse and goods imported for specific purposes. All the CPCs can be found in the Tariff, Volume 3. Appendices E, E1 and E2.</p>

<h3 id="community-status-and-free-circulation">Community status and free circulation</h3>

<p>The status declaration (box 1) is required when goods transit the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Goods that wholly originate in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> have ‘Community status’. This also includes imported goods which have had their customs charges paid. Community status goods can be moved around the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with no further customs charges. Goods arriving in or leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> which have their customs charges suspended will be deemed as ‘not being in free circulation’.</p>

<p>Community or common transit is a customs procedure that allows goods on which duty has yet to be paid to move from one country in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to another. It is also used to move goods to or via European Free Trade Association (<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr>) countries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Status T1 covers the movement of non-Community goods and <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods subject to a refund</li>
  <li>Status T2 covers the movement of Community goods to or via an <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> country, as well as to or from San Marino and Andorra</li>
  <li>Status T2F is used for Community goods moving to, from, or between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s special territories, such as the Channel Islands and the Canary Islands</li>
  <li>Status T5 covers the movement of <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and must be used to claim a <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> refund </li>
</ul>
<p>Where proof of status is required retrospectively, a declaration can be made on Copy 4 of the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> (C88). These documents are available by contacting the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> VAT helpline on 0845 010 9000.</p>

<h2 id="using-agents-for-single-administrative-document-submissions">Using agents for Single Administrative Document submissions</h2>

<p>There are two main types of customs agent who’ll act for you - direct or indirect agents. When acting directly for you, an agent isn’t liable for any debts of customs duty or VAT once a declaration is accepted. But when they act indirectly for a customer, in their own name, they’re jointly liable for all charges. Agents will process customs declarations and can pay your customs duties for you if they’re authorised to do so.</p>

<p>If an agent makes a declaration either electronically or on a <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> on your behalf then you must ensure they have all the information they need. This will include a copy of your invoice, classification of your goods and support information, such as import or export licences. You should also check the <abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> of your goods where you may have to pay duty or where you’re operating on a simplified or preferential basis.</p>

<h3 id="electronic-declarations">Electronic declarations</h3>

<p>Customs electronic systems are designed to make declaration processing easier. There are a number of solutions which have been created to allow traders to enter data from their own computers directly to the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system.</p>

<p>A service provider, such as a bureau service or broker, can normally act on your behalf in the capacity of a direct representative. Even if you nominate a third party to prepare and submit your customs declarations you still remain responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all the data. Where necessary <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can audit your declarations over the past four years.</p>

<p>When deciding whether to use an agent bear in mind that agents are likely to be experienced in completing the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> and transposing this information to the various electronic systems. Any mistake you make on your <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> can be costly and may result in you paying the incorrect amount of duty. Duties overpaid to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can be refunded but under payments can also be brought to account. Agents may use their experience to lower your transport costs by processing your goods as part of a larger consignment. If you choose to use an agent, you must give them complete information about your consignments. Agents will be able to give <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> more information about your goods than if you declared them yourself.</p>

<p>You may also want to use a freight forwarder - many of whom provide direct or indirect agent services. See using brokers and forwarders</p>

<h2 id="transport-and-description-of-goods-boxes-on-the-single-administrative-document">Transport and description of goods boxes on the Single Administrative Document</h2>

<p>This page explains how to complete the boxes of the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> that contain the description of your goods and how you move them. </p>

<p>In box 1, indicate whether or not the goods are already in free circulation in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and whether or not they have arrived. Use the code <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for European Free Trade Association countries, CO for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s special territories and IM for other goods.</p>

<p>Identify the consignor in box 2. For exports, if a UK identity is not supplied the consignor’s name and address must be provided. Identify the recipient in box 8. In box 14, give details of your type of representation with contact details.</p>

<p>Box 3 can be left blank if the declaration is only for a single item. Otherwise number the continuation sheets that you’re using. In box 4, enter the number of loading lists. Specify the total number of items in box 5 if you are making a declaration through <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and in box 6 the number of packages being declared. In box 7 choose whether you wish to enter your own reference number.</p>

<p>In box 18, identify the means of transport on which the goods are loaded. In box 21 enter a name and a nationality for the means of transport at the point of crossing the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border. Use the one digit code for the mode of transport that you use at the border in box 25 or at your own inland facilities in box 26. In box 30 give the location of the goods by country code, by location code and by shed/identity code. Codes can be found in the Tariff Volume 3.</p>

<p>In box 31 describe the goods and any packaging so they can be identified. If using a freight container you should give its identification number. In box 32 enter the declared number of goods in sequential order and assign them a commodity code in box 33 from the Tariff (Volume 2). The length of these will vary depending on whether goods are already in free circulation. If a <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> export refund is being given, country of origin must be given in box 34 otherwise it can be left blank. In box 38, give the weight in kilograms of your goods without any packaging. Only give the gross mass of your goods and packaging in box 35.</p>

<h2 id="valuation-of-consignment-boxes-on-the-single-administrative-document">Valuation of consignment boxes on the Single Administrative Document</h2>

<p>This page explains how to complete the boxes that value your goods in the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000199&amp;propertyType=document#P14_697">find out about valuing goods for import in Notice 252 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>If goods imported from countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> aren’t liable to customs duty then you may still need to produce a valuation declaration for VAT purposes. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000199&amp;propertyType=document#P14_697">find out about import VAT in Notice 702 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>In box 43 you should specify the method of valuation that you have used. In box 44 you must produce a coded valuation for goods.</p>

<p>For customs valuation purposes for currencies other than sterling enter the currency and total amount invoiced into box 22. Any foreign currency relating to the customs value must be converted to sterling in box 23, taking the rate quoted by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> as a basis.</p>

<p>When more than one unit of quantity is shown against the commodity code enter the quantity in box 41 up to three decimal points if duty is being paid. Otherwise round it up to the nearest whole number. The item price must be entered in box 42. To calculate the value for customs, indicate in box 45 the terms on which the invoice has been raised, so any adjustments can be made. The statistical value of the goods should then be entered in pounds sterling in box 46.</p>

<h2 id="taxes-and-preferences-boxes-on-the-sad">Taxes and preferences boxes on the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This page explains how to complete the boxes in the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> that determine the tax and customs treatment of your goods. </p>

<p>In box 47 there are five separate columns to be completed for each duty or tax on goods that are being declared:</p>

<ul>
<li>type (code to identify what tax or duty is being declared)</li>
  <li>base (the value or quantity to calculate tax or duty)</li>
  <li>rate (information relating to the rate applied)</li>
  <li>amount (how much is due)</li>
  <li>method of payment (more than one method can be used)</li>
</ul>
<p>For goods that are subject to <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> variable charges or anti-dumping duties an additional four digits apply to the commodity code (box 33), which you must take care entering as they represent a declaration which <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will use to assess the duty you pay.</p>

<p>In box 15 the country of dispatch need only be completed for controlled goods that require a full licensing declaration at the frontier. In entering the country of origin in box 34 decide on where the last substantial processing took place. Where goods are entering free circulation from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you must complete box 36. A three digit code determines whether any relief on duty applies. A claim for relief against a tariff quota should be made in box 39. In manual fallback situations write “Tariff Quota” in red ink on each page of your declaration.</p>

<p>You must complete box 39 when claiming a quota made available through the presentation of an appropriate <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> quota licence.  The licence and any other documentation required to support your application must be declared in box 44.</p>

<p>Enter the customs procedures codes for your goods in box 37. Seven digit codes must be used. The code you choose represents a binding legal commitment. Goods with different codes can be included on the same declaration but if they’re operating under a different regime, such as customs warehousing, then they will be treated as a seperate declaration. Enter any additional information about the consignment, such as certificate or authorisation codes, in box 44.</p>

<p>Enter codes for deferment of payment at importation in box 48 and for the identification of warehouses in box 49.</p>

<h2 id="single-administrative-document-completion-checklist">Single Administrative Document completion checklist</h2>

<p>Once you have completed the <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> make sure that you have completed all the necessary boxes. All details should be legible and, in manual <abbr title="The Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> declarations, you must initial corrections. Always check these key points:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you describe your goods, make sure that the commodity codes are consistent and correct.</li>
  <li>For VAT, check you have applied the correct - ie standard, reduced, or zero - rate.</li>
  <li>For reduced rates of duty, boxes 15, 34, 39 (if applicable), 44 and 47 must slot together for the purposes of a successful claim.</li>
  <li>Check all the goods and their full value on each invoice are included on the declaration. Always use the current <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> rate of exchange and valuation method.</li>
  <li>Enter the code for method of payment and complete all the tax lines. Scan the text for misplaced decimal points and for figures the wrong way round.</li>
  <li>Attach supporting documents in the right order. When submitted electronically, keep a copy of your submissions for audit purposes.  </li>
