<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Some of the activities pursued by the commercial fishing industry put many marine animals at risk. Sharks, for example, are affected by over-fishing and practices such as ‘finning’ - the removal of their fins before disposing the carcass at sea. Sharks, along with other marine species such as seabirds and dolphins, can also get caught accidentally in fishing gear and drown (known as bycatch).</p>

<p>The threat to marine life caused by fishing has become an important issue which the government has tried to prevent by introducing several pieces of legislation. European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) regulations provide Europe-wide protection to a number of species, and the UK has worked to ensure that such measures are strong, comprehensive and effective.</p>

<p>This guide highlights the dangers marine species face and outlines the measures taken to reduce those threats.</p>

<h2 id="sharks-skates-and-rays">Sharks, skates and rays</h2>

<p>Sharks, skates and rays - cartilaginous fish known as elasmobranchs - are caught in commercial fisheries in European and UK waters. Many species are over-fished and their numbers have fallen to dangerously low levels. Although some species are no longer fished commercially, often because they have a Total Allowable Catch of zero under the Common Fisheries Policy, species such as angel shark and white skate must be returned to the water if caught unintentionally.</p>

<p>Elasmobranchs are particularly at risk of over-fishing because:</p>

<ul>
<li>their migratory nature regularly leads them across international boundaries, making them difficult to manage</li>
  <li>they mature slowly and take a long time to reach breeding age</li>
  <li>they have relatively few young</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="protective-measures">Protective measures</h3>

<p>The UK government is committed to making sure that all fisheries on elasmobranch species are sustainable, and that endangered species have adequate protection. It has done, and will continue to do so by:</p>

<ul>
<li>developing a conservation plan to clearly lay out the  policies and aims on the issue</li>
  <li>introducing appropriate, scientifically-based conservation and fishery management measures within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and internationally</li>
  <li>improving controls on the catches of sharks wherever they are caught</li>
  <li>regulating the trade of shark products</li>
  <li>banning wasteful ‘finning’ wherever it takes place</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-wildlife-and-countryside-act">The Wildlife and Countryside Act</h3>

<p>The Wildlife and Countryside Act (<abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr>) affords protection to rare species of animals and plants, such as the angel shark and white skate, with both species now being listed in the revised Schedule 5. This means that you will be committing an offence if you intentionally or recklessly kill, injure, take, possess, transport or trade in either species up to 12 nautical miles off the English and Welsh coast.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/documents/interim2/shark-conservation-plan.pdf">find information on the shark, skate and ray conservation plan on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>The UK does not support the practice of removing shark fins before landing and does not permit landings of sharks with their fins removed. It is also calling for mandatory ‘fin on’ landings to be introduced and properly enforced throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. To find out more, see the following section on shark finning.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/52&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en">read questions and answers about the Shark Action Plan on the Europa website.</a></p>

<h2 id="shark-finning">Shark finning</h2>

<p>The demand for shark fin soup in some parts of the world has led to an increase in the practice of ‘shark finning’. This involves removing and retaining the fins from a shark on board a fishing vessel and disposing of the carcass at sea.</p>

<p>Although prohibited in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> some member states issue special permits to allow fishing vessels to process shark bodies and fins separately. The fins and the carcasses must both be landed, and the weight of the fins must not be more than 5% of the live weight of the sharks. However, as some shark species’ fins weigh less than 5% of their total live weight, this control measure could potentially enable more fins than shark bodies to be landed. This means that illegal shark finning could go undetected.</p>

<p>The UK does not issue special permits and will only allow ‘fin on’ shark landings. The government will push strongly for the introduction of this approach throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in the forthcoming review of the legislation to remove any potential loopholes and weaknesses in the law.</p>

<h2 id="tope">Tope</h2>

<p>Tope belong to the shark family and are found in European continental-shelf and coastal waters. Their numbers are at risk from fishing pressure because they:</p>

<ul>
<li>take around 12 years to reach maturity and start breeding</li>
  <li>produce relatively low numbers of young (known as pups)</li>
  <li>are an inevitable by-catch in commercial fisheries for other species</li>
</ul>
<p>Tope is a relatively low-value species commercially, although it is traditionally eaten in certain countries. In the UK, tope is a highly-prized sport fish.</p>

<h3 id="protective-measures-1">Protective measures</h3>

<p>Special legislation was introduced in 2008 to protect the species by limiting by-catch and preventing the development of commercial tope-fishing operations. The legislation applies within English and Welsh fishery limits and is designed to protect tope numbers by:</p>

<ul>
<li>banning all fishing for tope except by rod and line</li>
  <li>setting a 45 kilogram per day by-catch limit for tope in commercial fisheries for other species</li>
  <li>requiring any tope landed by commercial fishing vessels to have their head and fins still attached</li>
  <li>preventing recreational anglers from landing any tope - whether dead or alive - caught from a boat</li>
</ul>
<p>The legislation is designed to make recreational anglers and the commercial fishing community jointly responsible for tope conservation.</p>

<h2 id="dolphins-porpoises-and-whales">Dolphins, porpoises and whales</h2>

<p>Dolphins, porpoises and whales belong to a group of marine mammals known as cetaceans. There are 28 species of cetacean that have been recorded in UK waters, of which 11 appear regularly.</p>

<p>All cetaceans are legally protected throughout Europe. Under UK law it is illegal to:</p>

<ul>
<li>kill or injure a cetacean intentionally</li>
  <li>‘recklessly disturb’ a cetacean - for example to cause it distress by chasing it in a boat</li>
</ul>
<p>The UK has also signed up to the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (<abbr title="Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas">ASCOBANS</abbr>). This agreement aims to restore and maintain populations of small cetaceans through the co-ordination and implementation of conservation measures. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ascobans.org/index.html">find out about small cetacean conservation on the <abbr title="Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas">ASCOBANS</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="the-impact-of-commercial-fishing-activity">The impact of commercial fishing activity</h3>

<p>Although cetaceans have legal protection throughout Europe, they are sometimes caught and injured or killed accidentally during commercial fishing activities. When caught in fishing nets cetaceans, like dolphins and porpoises, are unable to surface to breathe, so often suffocate - this is known as ‘incidental by-catch’. The UK is committed to reducing this by-catch to the lowest level possible. Work undertaken to achieve this goal is focused on:</p>

<ul>
<li>monitoring cetacean species</li>
  <li>the development of mitigation measures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>

<p>The UK has a detailed and thorough cetacean monitoring programme to ascertain the extent of the by-catch problem.</p>

<p>While any by-catch is undesirable, recent population estimates suggest that porpoise and dolphin populations are not currently under threat.</p>

<p>To reduce cetacean by-catch rates to the lowest possible level, the government is working to identify fisheries and sea areas where the problem is greatest. Certain UK fisheries, such as static gillnets in the south west of England and the North Sea, are thought to have higher-than-normal by-catch rates. The monitoring programme focuses on these fisheries and areas to improve understanding and reduce by-catch levels.</p>

<h3 id="mitigation-measures">Mitigation measures</h3>

<p>The UK is focused on research into finding an effective acoustic deterrent device - often referred to as a ‘pinger’ - to deter cetaceans from approaching fishing gear and so reducing by-catch levels.</p>

<p>European legislation requires fishing vessels over a certain size to have pingers fitted. The UK government is currently carrying out a detailed research project in collaboration with the fishing industry with the aim of identifying an effective pinger that is safe for fishermen to use. Initial results are very encouraging, with the devices proving safe to use and significantly reducing by-catch numbers.</p>

<p>Current pinger research is due to be completed by March 2011, when the government and the fishing industry will examine the results and decide on the next steps to take.</p>

<h3 id="pair-trawling-for-bass">Pair trawling for bass</h3>

<p>Pair trawling for bass off the south-west coast of England has been shown to have a high level of cetacean by-catch compared to other fisheries. Because of this, pelagic pair trawling for bass by UK vessels is banned within 12 miles of the south-west coast of England (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) area VIIe). Other bass fisheries, such as gillnetting and handlining, and pair trawl fisheries targeting other species, are not affected by the ban.</p>

<p>The UK requested that the ban on pelagic pair trawling for bass be extended to vessels from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states, but this request was turned down by the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>. These vessels are currently permitted to fish between six and 12 miles off the coast of south-west England.</p>

<h2 id="seabirds">Seabirds</h2>

<p>Research suggests that a large number of seabirds are killed each year by getting caught in commercial fishing gear and becoming part of the by-catch. The seabirds most at risk from fishing activities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>shearwaters</li>
  <li>petrels</li>
  <li>fulmars</li>
  <li>gannets</li>
  <li>gulls</li>
  <li>sea dusks</li>
  <li>divers</li>
  <li>auks and grebes</li>
</ul>
<p>The Balearic shearwater is a critically endangered species that is particularly threatened by fishing activity in the Mediterranean.</p>

<h3 id="eu-seabird-action-plan">
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Seabird Action Plan</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has consulted on measures to reduce seabird by-catch in fishing gear and is developing an action plan with full UK support to implement the measures. You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/partners/consultations/seabirds/index_en.htm">get details of the Seabird Action Plan consultation on the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="seabird-by-catch-in-international-waters">Seabird by-catch in international waters</h3>

<p>The UK works with other countries and organisations to reduce seabird by-catch in international waters. It was involved with the development of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (<abbr title="Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels">ACAP</abbr>) in the Southern Oceans, and it continues to work with the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> to encourage regional fisheries management organisations to act on reducing seabird by-catch on the high seas.</p>
