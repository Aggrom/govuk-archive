<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Sea fishing is a multi-million pound industry involving a variety of vessels from modern sophisticated vessels to small open boats. It is important that all fishers understand the risks involved in fishing and what to do in an emergency, regardless of vessel type.</p>

<p>Before you go to sea as a fisherman you must undergo statutory safety training and be issued with certificates proving you have undergone the relevant training.</p>

<p>The rules governing the Certificate of Competency (<abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr>) are based on the size or power of a fishing vessel as well as its area of operation.</p>

<p>In this guide you will find information on safety training for fishers, Crew Agreements, the different <abbr title="Certificates of Competency">CoCs</abbr> and details about providers of fishing industry training.</p>

<h2 id="safety-training-for-boat-workers-and-certificates-of-competence">Safety training for boat workers and Certificates of Competence</h2>

<p>If you are a new entrant to the fishing industry you must attend the following safety training courses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Sea Survival</li>
  <li>Basic Fire Fighting and Prevention</li>
  <li>Basic First Aid</li>
  <li>Basic Health and Safety</li>
</ul>
<p>All new entrants must do the Basic Sea Survival course before going to sea for the first time. The other three basic safety training courses must be done within three months of starting work as a fisherman.</p>

<p>Any fisherman who has two years fishing experience must attend the Safety Awareness and Risk Assessment course. You can find training and certification requirements for fishing vessel crew in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>) Marine Guidance Note (<abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr>) 411, which also sets out in greater detail the certification requirements for fishing vessels that are 16.5 metres in length and above. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mgn_411.pdf">Download <abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr> 411 Training and Certification Requirements for the Crew of Fishing Vessels and their Applicability to Small Commercial Vessels and Large Yachts from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 389KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="certificates-of-competency">Certificates of Competency</h3>

<p>If you are a skipper, mate or engineer, working on fishing vessels that are 16.5 metres in length and above, or work on vessels with propulsive powers of 750 kilowatts, you are required to hold an <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can only get a <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> after assessment and examination, which consists of practical, written and oral components. <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/workingatsea/mcga-trainingandcert/mcga-fishing2.htm">Apply for or renew a Certificate of Competency</a> on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website.</p>

<h3 id="certificates-of-competency-for-personnel-on-fishing-vessels">Certificates of Competency for personnel on fishing vessels</h3>

<p>There are two specific <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> for deck personnel on fishing vessels:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deck Officer (Fishing Vessel) Class 1</li>
  <li>Deck Officer (Fishing Vessel) Class 2</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-shipsregsandguidance/marinenotices/mcga-mnotice.htm?textobjid=BE5B82E928925B53">find the Fishing Vessels (Certification of Deck Officers and Engineer Officers) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>If you hold Certificates of Service, which have not been issued since 1998, they can be used as an alternative to the <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> does not cover work on standby, seismic survey and oceanographic research vessels. However, suitably qualified fishing <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> holders can apply for a restricted <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> for these types of vessel.</p>

<p>There are two specific <abbr title="Certificates of Competency">CoCs</abbr> for engineering personnel on fishing vessels:</p>

<ul>
<li>Engineer Officer (Fishing Vessel) Class 1</li>
  <li>Engineer Officer (Fishing Vessel) Class 2</li>

<p>Workers can only serve on a ship if they hold <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> or a Certificate of Equivalent Competency (<abbr title="Certificate of Equivalent Competency">CEC</abbr>).</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Certificate of Equivalent Competency">CEC</abbr> allows officers holding Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping (<abbr title="Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping">STCW</abbr>) certificates issued by certain non-UK countries to work as officers on UK-registered merchant ships.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a <abbr title="Certificate of Equivalent Competency">CEC</abbr> from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>, you must be able to provide specific documents or evidence of qualifications to the Seafarer Training and Certification Branch. In some circumstances you may even have to prove your competency in the English language.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for a <abbr title="Certificate of Equivalent Competency">CEC</abbr>, there are certain criteria that you must meet.</p>

<p>CECs will be issued to officers holding <abbr title="Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping">STCW</abbr> <abbr title="Certificates of Competency">CoCs</abbr> issued by other Administrations if the UK authorities are satisfied that the <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> they hold is equivalent to their standards. <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/workingatsea/mcga-trainingandcert/mcga-fishing2.htm">Apply for or renew a <abbr title="Certificate of Equivalent Competency">CEC</abbr></a> on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website.</p>

<h3 id="uklap-requirements">
<abbr title="UK Legal and Administrative Processes">UKLAP</abbr> requirements</h3>

<p>Masters are required to pass the <abbr title="UK Legal and Administrative Processes">UKLAP</abbr> 1 exam, which can be taken via:</p>

<ul>
<li>an oral exam - conducted by an <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> Examiner</li>
  <li>a written test - by arrangement with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (<abbr title="Scottish Qualifications Authority">SQA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find details on the <abbr title="UK Legal and Administrative Processes">UKLAP</abbr> 1 syllabus in Annex 6 of <abbr title="Marine Guidance Note">MGN</abbr> 221.</p>

<p>After your application is processed, you will be issued with a Notice of Assessment (<abbr title="Notice of Assessment">NOA</abbr>), details of how to arrange the examination and the fee that you will have to pay. If you take the written test, you should contact the <abbr title="Scottish Qualifications Authority">SQA</abbr> once you have received the <abbr title="Notice of Assessment">NOA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Scottish Qualifications Authority">SQA</abbr> will be able to arrange for you to sit the <abbr title="UK Legal and Administrative Processes">UKLAP</abbr> 1 exam at a British Consular office around the world.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Masters who are nationals of EU or European Economic Area states can attain the required <abbr title="UK Legal and Administrative Processes">UKLAP</abbr> knowledge by completing a shipboard adaptation period of up to 36 months served onboard a UK ship.</p>

<p>Adaptation periods are at the discretion of the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> and normally vary between 2 and 6 months but you will be advised on the exact duration on application.</p>

<p>During an adaptation period, you must sail at a lower competence level than certified and you will be issued with a temporary lower ranked <abbr title="Certificate of Equivalent Competency">CEC</abbr> that is valid for up to six months. The Master of the vessel must also hold a full UK <abbr title="Certificate of Competency">CoC</abbr> or UK <abbr title="Certificate of Equivalent Competency">CEC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="crew-agreements">Crew Agreements</h2>

<p>Certain members of your crew must sign a Crew Agreement, which is an employment contract for a specified period of time that sets out their roles and responsibilities whilst at sea.</p>

<p>You will have to meet different crew document requirements according to the length of your fishing vessel.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessels-between-55-and-80-feet">Fishing vessels between 55 and 80 feet</h3>

<p>If your fishing vessel is between 55 and 80 feet you must have the following crew documents:</p>

<ul>
<li>list of crew - forms ALC(FSG) 4 outer cover (Red and Blue), ALC(FSG) l(b) list of crew, ALC l(c) list of young persons</li>
  <li>official log book</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparation-of-documents">Preparation of documents</h3>

<p>You must complete and sign the outer cover of ALC(FSG) 4 in accordance with the headings on it (except for the bottom section), remembering to fill in the red copy as well as the blue.</p>

<p>The list of crew form ALC(FSG) l(b)  must contain details of all those who are employed on board, in accordance with the column headings.</p>

<p>The official log book must be maintained in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 570 of 1981 that requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>the outer cover and pages 2 and 3 are completed in accordance with the various headings at the time of opening the crew agreement</li>
  <li>the instructions on births and deaths on pages 4 and 5 are followed closely, especially with regard to the Return of Death on form RBDl</li>
  <li>all crew member illness and injury on board the vessel is carefully recorded in the top half of pages 6 and 7 and also on form WRIK and then forwarded to the nearest Marine Office immediately when the vessel returns to port</li>
  <li>all casualties are recorded in the lower half of pages 6 and 7 and also reported in part IV of form WRIK and forwarded to the nearest Marine Office immediately</li>
  <li>all musters, including boat drills, training and inspections of fire and life saving appliances are recorded on Page 8</li>
  <li>the narrative section on pages 9-12 to contain a record of every crew member who is discharged from the vessel, as well as any occurrence not otherwise recorded</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disposal-of-documents-list-of-crew">Disposal of documents: list of crew</h3>

<p>The blue copy of a document is the ship’s duplicate and must be present on the vessel each time she goes to sea.</p>

<p>If you are a vessel owner, you must maintain a copy of the crew list ashore. The master of a vessel should - as soon as possible and within three days - notify the owner of any changes made in the list of crew members.</p>

<p>The red copy of the crew list must be delivered to the Marine Office within two days of being drawn up.</p>

<p>The list of crew remains active for six months from the date the first name is entered. It must be closed at the end of that period, or, if the vessel is then at sea, upon the first return to port within 30 days after that time. It must, in normal circumstances, be delivered to a Marine Office within two days of closing.</p>

<h3 id="disposal-of-documents-official-log-book">Disposal of documents: official log book</h3>

<p>When a vessel is at sea, the official log book must be kept on board at all times.</p>

<p>The log book remains in force for the same period as the list of crew and should be delivered to the Marine Office at the same time, in normal circumstances, within two days of closing.</p>

<p>If a radio log book is required, it should be delivered at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="reminders-list-of-crew">Reminders: list of crew</h3>

<p>If you are a master of a vessel it is your responsibility to complete and maintain the list of crew, except the copy kept ashore. You must also deliver the Red copy to the Marine Office.</p>

<p>When the list of crew is closed, you must complete the details required on the cover and ensure that it is properly completed to show dates and places of discharge, signatures, etc.</p>

<h3 id="reminders-official-log-books">Reminders: official log books</h3>

<p>For any vessel of 40 feet (12 metres) or more in length, but less than 80 feet (24.4 metres), the master must ensure that the crew are properly trained in the use and location of all life-saving and fire appliances and equipment and such training must be carried out once a month. The lifesaving equipment and fire appliances must also be inspected once a month.</p>

<p>If there is a failure to conduct any muster, drill, inspection or training session, you must write an explanatory entry in the official log book (page 8). There are therefore no circumstances in which the columns in page 8 of the log book should be left blank.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-vessels-over-80-feet-in-length">Fishing vessels over 80 feet in length</h3>

<p>The main difference with a fishing vessel over 80 feet in length is the number of documents that you must maintain in the Crew Agreements and list of crew. You will usually require the following documents on board:</p>

<ul>
<li>outer cover (Red and Blue)</li>
  <li>agreement - incorporating list of crew</li>
  <li>list of exempt persons - often not necessary</li>
  <li>list of young persons on board</li>
  <li>contractual clauses</li>
  <li>provisions and water</li>
  <li>crew copy</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-all-types-of-fishing-vessel">For all types of fishing vessel</h3>

<p>The list of crew Blue copy is the ship’s copy and must be on the vessel each time she goes to sea. A copy of this list should be maintained by the owner ashore. The list of crew Red copy must be delivered to the Marine Office within two days of being made up.</p>

<p>It is the master’s responsibility to complete and maintain the list of crew and to deliver the Red copy to the Marine Office. A master must complete the details required on the cover when the book is closed.</p>

<p>The official log book must be kept on board at all times and remains in force for the same period as the list of crew. If you fail to conduct any muster, drill, inspection or training session, you must write an explanatory entry in the official log book (page 8).</p>

<h3 id="breach-of-crew-agreements">Breach of Crew Agreements</h3>

<p>If a seafarer’s breach of Crew Agreement leads to expenses or losses to the vessel or business, they can be deducted a set amount of wages. The maximum wage deductions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>unauthorised absence - £100</li>
  <li>breach of duties under the Crew Agreement - £300</li>
  <li>breach of duties under a fishing vessel Crew Agreements - £200</li>
</ul>
