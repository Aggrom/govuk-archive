<p><a href="http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/" title="Ofwat" rel="external">Ofwat</a> regulates the water industry in England and Wales. There are different regulators in <a href="http://www.watercommission.co.uk/" title="Scottish water regulation" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.uregni.gov.uk/" title="Northern Ireland water regulation" rel="external">Northern Ireland.</a></p>

<h2>How you’ll be charged</h2>

<p>You’ll be charged for your water in one of two ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>pay for what you use, plus a set charge (if you’ve got a meter)</li>
  <li>a set charge, usually based on the value of your property</li>
</ul>
<p>Your business could be eligible for a <a rel="external" href="http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/consumerissues/chargesbills/nonhousehold/prs_web_largeusertariffs" title="large user tariff">large user tariff</a>, meaning your water might be cheaper. This is because it often costs less to supply larger businesses.</p>


</article><article id="sewerage-and-effluent"><header><h1>Part 2: Sewerage and effluent</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll be charged for any ‘foul sewerage’ (eg wastewater from a toilet or kitchen) and drainage from your property. The amount you pay is usually linked to how much water you use.</p>

<p>You’ll also have to pay for any effluent (liquid waste) you produce. Effluent is water contaminated with things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>fats, oils and grease</li>
  <li>chemicals</li>
  <li>food waste</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount your water supplier will charge is usually based on the amount and strength of the effluent before it reaches the sewer.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Sewerage charges can either appear on your water bill or your effluent bill, depending on your supplier.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="choosing-a-supplier"><header><h1>Part 3: Choosing a supplier</h1>
  </header><p>You may be able to choose your water and sewerage service provider depending on where your business is.</p>

<p>In England and Wales you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/competition/wsl/" title="find out if you're eligible for choosing your own water supplier">find out if you can choose your own supplier</a> by checking with Ofwat.</p>

<p>In Scotland you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.watercommission.co.uk/view_Register_of_licenses.aspx" title="list of water suppliers in Scotland">choose your own supplier</a> by checking with the Water Commission.</p>

<p>In Northern Ireland you can’t choose your own supplier - water is supplied by <a rel="external" href="http://www.niwater.com/" title="Northern Ireland Water (NI Water)">Northern Ireland Water.</a></p>
