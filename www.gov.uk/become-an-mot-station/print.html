</article><article id="your-application"><header><h1>Part 2: Your application</h1>
  </header><h2>Authorised Examiner (<abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status)</h2>

<p>You must have <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status to set up an MOT test station. </p>

<p>An <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> can be an individual, partnership or company authorised by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> is responsible for making sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the test facilities and equipment are checked and well-maintained </li>
  <li>the <a href="/become-an-mot-tester" title="become an MOT tester">Nominated Testers</a> are assessed correctly and complete training and quality checks</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> staff have access to the premises for checks on staff and equipment</li>
  <li>MOT documents are correctly stored and access to electronic MOT test systems is only given to eligible users</li>
  <li>MOT tests are properly conducted</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> is informed about significant changes to the business within 7 working days</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more information about the <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr>’s responsibilities in <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide to becoming an <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr>. </p>

</div>

<p>To apply for <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status, send form VT01 to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>. Use the same form if you already have <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status and want to open a test station. The guide to requirements for authorisation of <abbr title="Authorised Examiners">AEs</abbr> tells you more about the application process.</p>

<p>If your application is refused, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will write to you - you can appeal the decision and ask for a hearing by writing to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> within 14 days.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status doesn’t transfer with a business. If you’re buying an existing MOT station, you need to apply for <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status in your own right.</p>
</div>

<h3>Changes to your company</h3>

<p>You may need to apply for <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status again if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your company is reconstructed in a way that means it’s given a new company registration number</li>
  <li>a partner leaves or joins a partnership</li>
</ul>
<h2>Premises and equipment</h2>

<p>Different classes of vehicle require different test equipment and testing bay sizes. You’ll need to make sure you have at least the minimum level of acceptable equipment for each <a href="/become-an-mot-station/vehicle-classes" title="vehicle classes">vehicle class</a> you’re approved to test.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/Transport_Theme_files/Req_for_Auth_common_classes_1211.pdf" title="Download 'Requirements for authorisation for a vehicle testing station' (PDF, 47KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Requirements for authorisation for a vehicle testing station’ (PDF, 47KB)</a></p>
</div>

<p>You can ask for your premises to be approved in principle when applying for <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status. This can help you avoid committing to expensive work or alterations before your premises are approved.</p>

<p>If you’ve got <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status but want to make changes to the test facilities, <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/contactus/vosalocationsandofficesofthetrafficcommissioners/vosaenforcementoffices.htm" title="find your local VOSA office">write to <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr></a> before any changes are made, with supporting drawings, to show that the changes won’t affect the testing station’s approval.</p>


</article><article id="vehicle-classes"><header><h1>Part 3: Vehicle classes</h1>
  </header><p>When deciding which class of vehicle you’d like to test, you’ll need to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>the equipment needed to test the vehicles</li>
  <li>the size and layout of your premises</li>
  <li>whether the <a href="/become-an-mot-tester" title="become an MOT tester">Nominated Tester</a> is approved to test the different vehicle types you want to MOT</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements to test different classes</h2>

<p>The current requirements for testing each vehicle class are in the guides below. </p>

<p>These are just the minimum requirements - think carefully before deciding on your layout as it may affect the size or type of vehicle you’ll be able to test.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to make sure that you have a Nominated Tester who’s  approved to test the type of vehicles you’re applying to test.</p>

</article><article id="meeting-ongoing-standards"><header><h1>Part 4: Meeting ongoing standards</h1>
  </header><p>The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) will carry out regular risk-based site assessments of your station to make sure you continue to meet the standards. </p>

<p>This will involve checking it’s well maintained and that it offers clean and comfortable facilities, like suitable customer waiting areas.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the risk assessments <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will carry out in the guide below.</p>

<h2>Withdrawal of Authorised Examiner (<abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr>) status</h2>

<p>If you’re approved as an <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> but the service you’re giving is found to have shortcomings, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> may take disciplinary action or stop you operating as a testing station.</p>

<p>If you lose <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status for disciplinary reasons, anyone applying for <abbr title="Authorised Examiner">AE</abbr> status at the same test station must be able to prove that they’re sufficiently independent from whoever the disciplinary action was taken against.</p>

<h2>Special notices</h2>
<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> uses ‘special notices’ to tell you about changes to the MOT scheme. <abbr title="Authorised Examiners">AEs</abbr> receive these automatically. You can read the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/publications/specialnotices/specialnotices.htm" title="Special notices">latest special notices</a> on the <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> website.</p>


</article><article id="additional-phone-lines-and-vts-devices"><header><h1>Part 5: Additional phone lines and VTS devices</h1>
  </header><p>Depending on the number of MOT tests your vehicle testing station (<abbr title="vehicle testing station">VTS</abbr>) performs, you may be eligible for a dedicated phone line and/or an additional dedicated computer for recording MOT tests, known as a <abbr title="vehicle testing station">VTS</abbr> device.</p>

<h2>What you’ll get</h2>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Average number of MOT tests per day</th>
      <th>What you get</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>7 or more</td>
      <td>dedicated phone line</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>15 or more</td>
      <td>additional <abbr title="vehicle testing station">VTS</abbr> device</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You’ll qualify for third and subsequent devices once you exceed multiples of 15 completed MOT tests per day - that is 30, 45, 60, etc.</p>

<p>If you think your test centre qualifies, you’ll need to make a request to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA). They will then do a review based on your test volumes for the last 6 complete calendar months.</p>

<p>Contact the VOSA service desk to request a dedicated phone line or additional <abbr title="vehicle testing station">VTS</abbr> device.</p>
