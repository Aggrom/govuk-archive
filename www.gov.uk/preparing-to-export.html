<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Exporting can extend your market, boost your turnover and prevent you having too great a dependence on your UK-based customers. But it isn’t always an easy option. Starting to export poses a whole new set of challenges, from identifying promising markets and customers to ensuring that you can fulfil your export contracts. Developing new export markets takes time and money.</p>

<p>A planned approach helps you to identify the best opportunities. It ensures that you understand what’s involved, and have the resources and skills you need.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087335890&amp;r.l3=1087336389&amp;r.l4=1074026849&amp;topicId=1078258802">Use the interactive tool to identify what you need to know to export to your target country.</a></p>

<h2 id="understand-the-challenges-of-exporting">Understand the challenges of exporting</h2>

<p>Exporting isn’t simply an add-on to your existing business. It should be part of an overall strategy to develop the business.</p>

<p>Before you start exporting it’s worth making sure you have developed a complete export plan looking at all the costs and risks involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exporting presents all the normal challenges of marketing in the UK - it’s up to you to find customers and convince them to buy from you. Understanding what customers want and how the market operates is vital. See the guide on entering overseas markets.</li>
  <li>You need to cope with extra logistical problems, contractual issues and paperwork. You’ll probably want a contract drawn up using internationally recognised terms and conditions and standard commercial practices to make it clear what your responsibilities are. There’s also a range of paperwork for sorting out transport, customs clearance and payments. See our guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-trade-paperwork-the-basics">international trade paperwork: the basics</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are VAT registered you must provide details of all your transactions with other European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states on your VAT return. If the value of goods you buy from or sell to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries reaches the sales or purchases Intrastat threshold during the course of a calendar year you must submit additional monthly supplementary declarations to HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Intrastat thresholds are reviewed annually. The 2011 thresholds are £600,000 for arrivals and £250,000 for dispatches. See the guide: <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087335890&amp;r.l3=1087336389&amp;r.l4=1074026849&amp;topicId=1074185901">introduction to Intrastat</a>.</li>
  <li>You need to comply with regulations in both the UK and overseas. For example, some goods that are allowed in the UK might not satisfy another country’s standards or even be legal there.</li>
  <li>Exporting demands additional resources, both in terms of financing and skilled personnel. It can also present extra risks. See our guide on how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087335890&amp;r.l3=1087336389&amp;r.l4=1074026849&amp;topicId=1074296228">manage the risks of exporting</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the additional costs, such as international transport, you may find you simply can’t compete with local suppliers. If the market only offers low margins or you haven’t got the resources you need, you may decide that exporting isn’t for you.</p>

<p>But if you have got a good product to offer and a well-run business the chances are there are opportunities out there. If the rewards you expect justify the investment and the risks, you should commit to your export plan and make it happen.</p>

<h2 id="assess-your-skills-and-resources-for-exporting">Assess your skills and resources for exporting</h2>

<p>To start exporting successfully you should take a planned approach and create an export strategy. You need to spend time and money planning, researching market opportunities and building relationships. You may also need to invest in modifying your product and service to suit overseas customers.</p>

<p>Exporting is usually a way of growing a successful business rather than an easy way out for one that’s in trouble. If you’re struggling with limited finances or overworked employees you may not have the resources to take on the extra work. </p>

<h3 id="special-skills">Special skills</h3>

<p>Once you have planned your exporting activities you also need to devote extra resources to handling your exporting business. Marketing to overseas customers tends to be more demanding than selling within the UK. Exporting also needs special skills - such as organising international transport and handling customs clearance.</p>

<p>Many businesses find that the best way to get started is to buy in the services they need and build in-house skills and resources later. For example, you might use a local agent to sell and a freight forwarder to handle deliveries. See how to use the right export support services further on in this guide.</p>

<h3 id="additional-financing">Additional financing</h3>

<p>Exporting can also be financially demanding. Customers often want credit from the time they receive the goods. For a long distance shipment this could be weeks after you produced and shipped the goods, so you get paid later than you would by a customer in the UK. At the same time you may have to meet extra costs like transport and insurance.</p>

<p>The more successful you are the greater the demands placed on your business. It’s worth planning ahead to be sure you have the capacity to handle the extra production, selling and after-sales support.</p>

<p>Find out about the training, planning and support services offered by the Developing your International Trade Potential programme on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/howwehelp.html">UK Trade &amp; Investment website.</a></p>

<h2 id="assess-export-market-opportunities">Assess export market opportunities</h2>

<p>You might first consider exporting in response to enquiries from potential customers overseas. Or you might actively decide to look for opportunities. In either case, thorough market research is essential.</p>

<p>You need to understand what overseas customers want and what the competition is like. As well as local suppliers you may be competing with other exporters from around the world.</p>

<h3 id="reaching-customers">Reaching customers</h3>

<p>It’s worth thinking about how you will reach customers. For example, the internet might be a good way of reaching customers - or even selling directly - in a market where many customers use the internet. </p>

<p>You’ll also want to understand all the issues that affect doing business in that country. There may be legal considerations, like product regulations or licences or extra taxes that make it difficult to compete. See the guide: <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087335890&amp;r.l3=1087336389&amp;r.l4=1074026849&amp;topicId=1074185375">do you need an export or import licence?</a> You might be faced with a different business culture, and need to communicate in the local language.</p>

<h3 id="deciding-what-to-offer">Deciding what to offer</h3>

<p>UK products and services often need to be modified to suit local regulations and customers’ requirements. You’ll also need to think about what after-sales service you need to provide and the best way of doing so.</p>

<p>Identify your business’ current capacity to export with the export for growth tool on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.improve.businesslink.gov.uk/resources/tools/exporting-growth">Growth and Improvement Service.</a></p>

<p>All this adds costs - over and above the additional costs such as delivery. Many exporters find that they need to position their product as a premium brand to justify higher prices and cover all these costs.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide to researching and entering overseas markets.</p>

<h2 id="choose-which-export-markets-to-enter">Choose which export markets to enter</h2>

<p>Different markets often have different requirements. For example, product modifications that suit customers in China might be the opposite of what customers in Canada want.</p>

<p>Trying to export to several different countries can be very expensive. Unless you tailor what you offer to suit each individual market you may fail to offer what customers really want.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s usually best to focus on selling to one or two individual markets. In large countries like the US, you might even concentrate on a particular region, and roll out gradually across the country as you build your market presence.</p>

<p>Your nearest International Trade adviser help you choose the most appropriate market for your product. Find your local international trade team on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/unitedkingdom/contactus.html">UK Trade &amp; Investment website.</a></p>

<p>Many new exporters choose to start by exporting to markets that are relatively easy to deal with. For example, the practicalities of dispatching goods to countries within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are relatively straightforward. Many trading practices, regulations and standards apply throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and key tasks such as accounting for VAT have been simplified. This can be a good way of building your export skills.</p>

<p>Or you might choose to target a market where you have some links - eg through your family, personal contacts or employee knowledge.</p>

<p>Developing countries can be riskier to deal with. The risks are generally lower if the country has an investment protection and promotion agreement with the UK.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide which markets offer the best opportunities and suit your own export strategy. To identify potential promising markets see the information within this section about assessing export market opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="plan-your-export-market-entry-strategy">Plan your export market entry strategy</h2>

<p>The best way to sell into an export market depends on your circumstances and local market conditions. For example, if local wholesalers dominate the market for your product you might target them rather than trying to sell directly to end-customers.</p>

<p>You also need to think about how to promote yourself. It’s important to take local culture and regulations into account. For example, it might be illegal to advertise your product to children, or the name of your product might have an unwanted meaning in the local language.</p>

<p>If you work with a local agent or distributor you will benefit from their local contacts and expertise. In some countries working with a local partner is almost essential - or even legally required.</p>

<p>For many businesses, the internet is a good way of marketing to customers overseas, or even selling directly to them. See the guide to <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087335890&amp;r.l3=1087336389&amp;r.l4=1074026849&amp;topicId=1075383789">planning for e-commerce.</a> Trade visits can also be an important part of creating awareness, building relationships and making sales.</p>

<p>You should think about practical aspects as well, such as clearing goods through overseas customs. If you are dealing with experienced importers they may be prepared to take responsibility for this themselves. Otherwise, you might want to work with an experienced agent or freight forwarder who can handle this. </p>

<h2 id="manage-export-contracts-and-logistics">Manage export contracts and logistics</h2>

<p>Like any sales contract, you need to agree what goods you will deliver and when. The agreement should make it clear who is at risk if the goods are lost or damaged at any stage during delivery. Your agreement also needs to cover where you will deliver the goods and whether you will arrange for them to be cleared through customs.</p>

<p>It’s good practice to use internationally recognised Incoterms in your contract to set out the responsibilities for transport and insurance. See the guides to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-trade-paperwork-the-basics">international trade paperwork: the basics</a>.</p>

<p>Taking on more responsibility can help you to be more competitive, particularly if you are selling to customers who do not have import experience. But you also face increased costs and risks. Whatever you agree, it’s important to be sure that you can handle your responsibilities. International trade paperwork can be complicated, and mistakes can be costly. You may want to use specialist help such as a freight forwarder. </p>

<h3 id="payment">Payment</h3>

<p>You need to agree how much the customer will pay, when payment will be due, and how payment will be made. Different payment methods, such as advance payment or letters of credit give you more security than giving your customer open account credit. See the guide to getting paid when selling overseas.</p>

<p>Pricing in the local currency rather than pounds sterling can help make you more competitive but puts you at risk if exchange rates change. See the guide to foreign currency and exchange risks.</p>
