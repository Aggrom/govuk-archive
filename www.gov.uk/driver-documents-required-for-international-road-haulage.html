<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Once the route of your European or international road haulage job is clear, you will want to draw up a checklist of the documents you’ll need to carry with you in order to comply with the customs and regulatory controls in the destination country and in each of the countries you cross during your trip.</p>

<p>Vehicle drivers and any other persons travelling in a commercial vehicle carrying goods between countries must carry prescribed documents.</p>

<p>This guide aims to provide details of the main documents you must have with you to satisfy the regulations as you cross each international border.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-visas-drivers-licence-and-age-restrictions">Passports and visas, driver’s licence and age restrictions</h2>

<p>You must have a number of documents to hand when making international trips out of the UK.</p>

<h3 id="passports">Passports</h3>

<p>UK passports are issued by the Identity &amp; Passport Service (<abbr title="Identity &amp; Passport Service">IPS</abbr>). <a rel="external" href="http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/ips_live/hs.xsl/1056.htm">Find information on how to apply for or renew a passport on the <abbr title="Identity &amp; Passport Service">IPS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>To travel abroad, vehicle drivers and any passengers or crew members in the vehicle must each have a valid passport. You should check the expiration date and the entry rules of the countries on your route. Some countries may require a passport to be valid for a certain period after entry, eg to enter Turkey you must have six months left on your passport. <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/passports1/">Find out more about passport requirements on the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visas">Visas</h3>

<p>Holders of EU passports do not need visas for entry into other EU member states, but may need a visa if travelling beyond the EU. <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/passports1/entry-requirements">Find information on passport validity and the visa and entry requirements of foreign countries on the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="drivers-licence">Driver’s licence</h3>

<p>Drivers of goods vehicles must hold a licence appropriate to the vehicle they drive. <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/DriverLicensing/WhatCanYouDriveAndYourObligations/DG_4022547">Find a list of vehicle category descriptions and the minimum driving age for each category on the Directgov website</a>.</p>

<p>Holders of large goods vehicle (<abbr title="Large Goods Vehicle">LGV</abbr>) driving licences have to meet a high standard of driving conduct. If you’re applying for an <abbr title="Large Goods Vehicle">LGV</abbr> driving licence you’ll need to let the DVLA know about any convictions you have had within the last four years for breaking the rules on:</p>

<ul>
<li>driver’s hours</li>
  <li>driver’s records</li>
  <li>the roadworthiness of your vehicle</li>
  <li>overloading of the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/DriverLicensing/WhatCanYouDriveAndYourObligations/DG_4022549">Read about your obligations on driving conduct on the Directgov website</a>.</p>

<p>You can use your current UK licence to drive the categories of vehicle for which it is entitled in all EU member states and European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) countries. <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/DriverLicensing/DG_10023103">Find information on driving in another country on the Directgov website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="international-driving-permit">International driving permit</h3>

<p>The International Driving Permit (<abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr>) is a multi-language document which translates the details of national driving licences. It enables foreign authorities to interpret the identity of the permit holder, the driving category entitlements held and their validity periods. The <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr> supports, but does not replace, your photocard or paper driving licence and it is recommended that you still carry your full UK driving licence and passport with you at all times.</p>

<p>IDPs are issued by the major motoring organisations, which will also provide advice on the countries in which an <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr> is required:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html">read about and apply for an <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr> on the AA website</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit/">read about and apply for an <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr> on the RAC website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be a member of either organisation to apply for an <abbr title="International Driving Permit">IDP</abbr>, but you must be resident in the UK, over 18 years of age and have passed a driving test.</p>

<h2 id="fuel-duty-and-value-added-tax">Fuel duty and value added tax</h2>

<p>If you drive in foreign countries, especially large goods vehicles, you need to be aware that customs officers in other countries may charge extra fuel duty on entry.</p>

<h3 id="taxes-on-uk-fuel-entering-other-countries">Taxes on UK fuel entering other countries</h3>

<p>Motor fuel is generally sold at a tax-inclusive price, and British vehicles are not exempt from this form of taxation when abroad. Fuel entering a country in the standard tanks of a vehicle is usually exempt from additional taxes, but some countries restrict the amount of fuel that may be imported duty free. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000164&amp;propertyType=document#P15_762">Find information on the fuel you can legally use in a road vehicle on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>Under EU rules there is no limit on the amount of fuel which may be carried between member states in standard running tanks, provided that it remains in these and is not off loaded.</p>

<p>Although an EU directive now defines what constitutes ‘standard tanks’, the definition is open to differing interpretation, particularly in France and Belgium. These countries sometimes claim that supplementary tanks fall outside this category. For a tank to qualify as a ‘standard tank’, a driver must be able to show that it is of a type that was permanently fitted by the manufacturer to all motor vehicles of the same type as the vehicle in question and whose permanent fitting enables fuel to be used directly for propulsion or, where appropriate, by refrigeration or other systems.</p>

<p>French and Belgian authorities sometimes claim that ‘catwalk tanks’ and ‘belly tanks’ fail this qualification. Drivers of vehicles are sometimes charged additional duty, or even fined, when carrying fuel in such tanks.</p>

<h2 id="drivers-hours-and-tachographs">Drivers’ hours and tachographs</h2>

<p>Drivers of goods vehicles on international journeys within the EU must comply with EU and/or GB rules on drivers’ hours and tachograph use. These rules prescribe maximum limits on driving time and minimum requirements for break and rest periods. They apply to most drivers of vehicles used for the carriage of goods where the maximum permissible weight of the vehicle, including any trailer or semi-trailer, exceeds 3.5 tonnes.</p>

<p>However, working time rules vary and there are certain exemptions.</p>

<p>Journeys to or through the countries that are signatories to the European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport (<abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr>) are subject to <abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr> rules. <abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr> rules apply to the whole journey, including any EU countries passed through.</p>

<p>For countries not subject to the EU or <abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr> rules, such as Iceland or Morocco, you should contact their Embassies for the applicable rules.</p>

<h3 id="tachographs">Tachographs</h3>

<p>Under the EU/<abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr> rules, it is compulsory to use a tachograph. On UK trucks they should be set to UK time.</p>

<p>When required, drivers must be able to produce, at the roadside:</p>

<ul>
<li>tachograph charts and any legally required manual records for the current day and the previous 28 calendar days</li>
  <li>the driver’s digital smart card, if they hold one</li>
</ul>
<p>On international journeys, drivers should carry letters of attestation from their employers in the language of each country to be visited to cover sick leave, annual leave or other periods of inactivity, or any time spent driving a vehicle which is out of the scope of EU/<abbr title="European Agreement Concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles Engaged in International Road Transport">AETR</abbr> rules during the preceding 28 days. However, use of the form is only mandatory in certain member states and this is set out in a table alongside the link to the form.</p>

<h3 id="digital-tachographs-and-digital-tacho-cards">Digital tachographs and digital tacho cards</h3>

<p>Digital tachographs provide detailed information and enable a range of printouts including a daily activities sheet showing distances, speeds and the length of time the vehicle was stationary.</p>

<p>If your vehicle is fitted with a digital tachograph, the digital tacho card or driver smart card you use to operate it is valid for five years. The card’s microchip will stop recording driver activity on the expiry date. If you don’t receive a renewal reminder, you can find out how to renew your card in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tachographs">drivers and digital tachographs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="downloading-tachograph-and-driver-card-data">Downloading tachograph and driver card data</h3>

<p>European regulations set out the maximum periods within which you must download any data recorded by the digital tachograph - other than detailed speed data - from the vehicle unit and driver card:</p>

<ul>
<li>90 days for data from the vehicle unit</li>
  <li>28 days for data from the vehicle card</li>
</ul>
<p>You must download the data in such a way that none is lost.</p>

<h2 id="insurance-and-medical-documents-for-drivers">Insurance and medical documents for drivers</h2>

<p>In some countries drivers are held to be legally responsible for their loads, whether or not they know of the contents.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to leave photocopies of all medical, insurance and legal documents as back-up with family or friends in case you should need copies after your company’s normal business hours.</p>

<p>In some EU and other countries your vehicle must carry warning equipment, such as visibility clothing and warning triangles and spare bulbs.</p>

<h3 id="insurance">Insurance</h3>

<p>You should obtain comprehensive insurance before travelling. You should check carefully for any exclusions and that your policy includes medical, health, personal liability and legal expenses cover and 24-hour emergency assistance. <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/staying-safe/travel-insurance/">Find advice on travel insurance on the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card">European Health Insurance Card</h3>

<p>Throughout the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries and Switzerland, the European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) allows you access to the same state-provided healthcare as a resident of the country you are visiting.</p>

<p>In some countries, healthcare will be at a reduced cost or even free of charge, but even with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, many countries expect the patient to pay towards their treatment. You should try to claim reimbursement for this cost before you leave the country in which you were treated, but if you are not able to do so, you may be able to seek a refund when you are back in the UK.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/EHIC/Pages/About.aspx">Find further information about the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> on the NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>Some non EU and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries have also signed up to the EIHC scheme. <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/countryguidance/nonEEAcountries/Pages/NonEEAcountries.aspx">Read guidance on travelling outside of the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> on the NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.ehic.org.uk">apply for an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> on the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="emergencies">Emergencies</h3>

<p>British diplomatic consuls in foreign countries can be a valuable first-port-of-call for help in the event of an emergency. There are many things that British consuls have the ability to do to help UK citizens in difficulty. <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/">Find guidance on the support available for British Nationals abroad on the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> website</a>.</p>
