  </header><h2>When you can get State Pension</h2>

<p>Retiring early won’t have an effect on when you can get your State Pension. The earliest you can get your State Pension is when you reach <a rel="external" href="http://pensions-service.direct.gov.uk/en/state-pension-age-calculator/home.asp" title="State Pension age">your State Pension age.</a></p>

<h2>How much State Pension you get</h2>

<p>Your State Pension is based on how much National Insurance you have paid or been credited. You <a href="/state-pension" title="State Pension qualifying and claiming">qualify</a> for National Insurance when you’re working or if you’re a parent, carer or claiming certain benefits.</p>

</article><article id="personal-and-workplace-pensions"><header><h1>Part 2: Personal and workplace pensions</h1>
  </header><h2>When you get your personal or workplace pension</h2>

<p>When you can get your pension will depend on your pension rules, but it must be after you’re 55.</p>

<p>You may be able to take your pension before this age if you’re retiring because of ill-health.</p>

<p>You can retire at any age if you have serious ill-health and you have less than a year’s life expectancy. You can take up to 100% of your pension fund as a tax-free lump sum. If you’re married or a civil partner when you take the payment, the pension scheme must keep at least 50% of your pension pot to provide a pension for your husband, wife or civil partner.</p>

<h2>How much personal and workplace pension you get</h2>

<p>There are 2 types of workplace and personal pension. These are called ‘money purchase’ and ‘salary related’ pensions. Check your pension to find out which type you have.</p>

<h3>How much your money purchase pension is worth</h3>

<p>The value of your pension will be depend on how your investment has performed. Your money purchase pension will be smaller if you retire early because:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve had fewer years to pay into your pension</li>
  <li>your pension will need to last longer</li>
</ul>
<h3>How much your salary related pension is worth</h3>

<p>Your salary-related pension is usually based on a fraction of either your final salary or your career average salary, depending on which type of scheme you are a member of. If you’re considering early retirement you’ll probably receive a smaller pension.</p>
