  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re an employee, you can take both:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>1 or 2 weeks of Ordinary Paternity Leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>up to 26 weeks’ Additional Paternity Leave if you’re the main carer (only when the child’s mother has returned to work)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You must start and end Ordinary Paternity Leave within 56 days of your baby’s arrival.</p>

<h2>You have more than one baby</h2>
<p>If your partner has a multiple birth, for example twins, you’ll only get one period of paternity leave.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You don’t have a legal right to time off for antenatal appointments but speak to your employer as you may be able to come to an arrangement.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you lose your child</h2>
<p>You can take Ordinary Paternity Leave if your child is stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy or born alive at any point of the pregnancy.</p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><h2>Ordinary Paternity Leave</h2>
<p>You can choose to take either 1 or 2 weeks of Ordinary Paternity Leave.</p>

<p>You can’t take odd days off and if you take 2 weeks, you must take them together.</p>

<p>If you don’t work full time, a week’s leave is the same amount of days that you normally work in a week. For example, if you only work Mondays and Tuesdays, a week is 2 days. </p>

<p>You must start and end Ordinary Paternity Leave within 56 days of your baby’s arrival.</p>

<h2>Additional Paternity Leave</h2>
<p>If you’re eligible, you can take up to 26 weeks of Additional Paternity Leave.</p>

<p>You can start Additional Paternity Leave from 20 weeks after your child arrives - it must end by your child’s 1st birthday (or 1 year after adoption). </p>

<p>You can only take Additional Paternity Leave once your child’s mother or adopter has returned to work. </p>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><h2>Ordinary Paternity Leave</h2>
<p>You must have worked for your employer for at least 26 weeks by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the end of the 15th week before the start of the week when your baby is due</li>
  <li>the end of the week you’re told you’re matched with your adopted child </li>
  <li>the date your child enters Great Britain (if you’re adopting from overseas)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>the biological father of the child</li>
  <li>the mother’s husband or partner (including same-sex relationships)</li>
  <li>the child’s adopter </li>
  <li>the husband or partner (including same-sex relationships) of the child’s adopter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Paternity Leave</h2>
<p>You must be taking time off to care for your child. Your child’s mother or adopter must have been entitled to one or more of the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Maternity Leave</li>
  <li>Statutory Maternity Pay</li>
  <li>Maternity Allowance</li>
  <li>Statutory Adoption Leave or Pay</li>
</ul>
<p>Your partner must have started working again and no longer be getting any of the above. </p>

<p>You must be with the same employer the week (Sunday to Saturday) before you want to start your Additional Paternity Leave.</p>

</article><article id="how-to-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: How to claim</h1>
  </header><h2>Ordinary Paternity Leave</h2>

</div>

<p>You don’t have to provide medical evidence of the pregnancy or birth to claim Ordinary Paternity Leave.</p>

<h2>Additional Paternity Leave</h2>
<p>You must tell your employer in writing at least 8 weeks before you want to start your additional leave. You can use the forms below (but check if your employer has their own form).</p>

</div>

<p>Your employer may ask you for:</p>

<ul>
<li>a copy of your child’s birth certificate or adoption matching certificate</li>
  <li>the employment details of the mother or adopter </li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll need to provide this information within 28 days.</p>

</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><h2>If you’re no longer your child’s main carer</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must tell your employer straight away if you’re no longer eligible for Additional Paternity Leave.</p>
</div>

<p>This might be because your partner isn’t going back to work, or you won’t be caring for your child. </p>

<h3>Unpaid leave</h3>
<p>Your employer can insist you take unpaid leave if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you don’t give 6 weeks’ notice</li>
  <li>your change in circumstances is not practical for them</li>
</ul>
<p>Your unpaid leave will start on the date your paternity leave was due to start and will end after 6 weeks or the date your paternity leave was due to end (whichever is earlier). </p>

<p>If your partner starts working part time or becomes self-employed (but isn’t getting Statutory Maternity Pay, Maternity Allowance or Statutory Adoption Pay) you’re still eligible for Additional Paternity Leave.</p>

<h2>Company paternity leave schemes</h2>
<p>Your employer may have their own paternity leave scheme. You can choose the government’s statutory Paternity Leave scheme if it suits you better and you qualify for it.</p>

<h2>Contact with your employer</h2>
<p>Your employer is entitled to make reasonable contact with you during Additional Paternity Leave, eg to let you know about changes at work such as job vacancies. </p>

<h3>Keeping in touch days</h3>
<p>You can work up to 10 days during your Additional Paternity Leave if both you and your employer agree. You’ll need to agree with your employer what work you’ll do and how much pay you’ll get.</p>

<h2>If you disagree with the decision</h2>
<p>If your application for Paternity Leave is turned down, talk to your employer and explain your rights. You could ask for advice from your trade union or a voluntary organisation like <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk" title="Citizens Advice">Citizens Advice.</a></p>

<h2>If your partner dies</h2>
<p>If your partner dies before your child’s 1st birthday (or before 1 year after adoption) you may be able to extend Additional Paternity Leave up to 52 weeks. You can’t do this if your leave has already ended. You need to send your employer form SC10 (or your employer’s own form) within 8 weeks of your partner’s death.</p>
