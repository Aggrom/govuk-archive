{"alternative_title":"Driving eyesight rules and visual standards for driving","body":"$!If you need to wear glasses or contact lenses to meet the 'standards of vision for driving' you must wear them every time you drive.$!\r\n\r\nYou must tell DVLA if you've got any problem with your eyesight that affects both of your eyes, or the remaining eye if you only have one eye.\r\n\r\n^This doesn\u2019t include being short or long sighted or colour blind. You also don\u2019t need to say if you\u2019ve had surgery to correct short sightedness and can meet the eyesight standards.^\r\n\r\nCheck if you need to tell DVLA about your eyesight problem by searching the [A to Z of medical conditions](/health-conditions-and-driving \"A to Z of medical conditions\") that could affect your driving.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Standards of vision for driving\r\n\r\nYou must be able to read (with glasses or contact lenses, if necessary) a car number plate made after 1 September 2001 from 20 metres. \r\n\r\nYou must also meet the minimum eyesight standard for driving by having a visual acuity of at least decimal 0.5 (6/12) measured on the [Snellen scale](http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/registeringsightloss/Pages/vision_criteria.aspx#H2Heading1 \"Snellen scale\"){:rel=\"external\"} (with glasses or contact lenses, if necessary) using both eyes together or, if you have sight in one eye only, in that eye.\r\n\r\nYou must also have an adequate field of vision \u2013 your optician can tell you about this and do a test. \r\n\r\n##The practical driving test eyesight test\r\n\r\nAt the start of your practical driving test you have an eyesight test. You\u2019ll have to correctly read a number plate on a parked vehicle.\r\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t pass the eyesight test you\u2019ll fail your driving test and the test won\u2019t continue. DVLA will be told and your licence will be revoked.\r\n\r\nWhen you reapply for your driving licence, DVLA will ask you to have an eyesight test with the Driving Standards Agency (DSA). This will be at a driving test centre. If you're successful, you'll still have to pass the DSA standard eyesight test at your next practical driving test.\r\n\r\n*[DVLA]: Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency","overview":"The eyesight rules to pass your driving test and for whenever you're driving ","slug":"driving-eyesight-rules","title":"Driving eyesight rules","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:12:40+00:00","type":"answer"}
