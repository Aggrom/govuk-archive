<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Pests and diseases in fruits and vegetables can have a negative economic impact on individual commercial producers and on the entire fruit and vegetable industry. In addition to indigenous species and strains, there is a threat from the spread of foreign pests and diseases that could impact on the UK fruit and vegetable production industry.</p>

<p>It is important that you can recognise early signs of pests and diseases in your crops in order to deal with the problem and inform your local Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate if necessary.</p>

<p>This guide explains various indigenous diseases that can affect fruit and vegetables. It gives details of the recognisable symptoms for these diseases, and possible treatments and prevention methods. It also covers foreign pests and diseases that are a threat to certain sectors of the UK fruit and vegetable sector, and guidance to ensure these threats are removed.</p>

<h2 id="pests-and-diseases-affecting-fruit-and-vegetables">Pests and diseases affecting fruit and vegetables</h2>

<p>Pests and diseases in fruit and vegetables can have an economic impact on your business. It is important that you can recognise early signs of pests and diseases to limit the damage caused to your crops.</p>

<p>The Food and Environment Research Agency (<abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr>) is responsible for plant heath regulations and works with the Forestry Commission to form the UK Plant Health Service. It also works with other European member states and the European Commission to agree appropriate plant health rules for Europe and co-ordinate their implementation. <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> has a list of high-profile pests which affect fruit and vegetables and are a serious threat to commercial growers. These pests include:</p>

<ul>
<li>potato ring rot</li>
  <li>potato brown rot </li>
  <li>potato cyst nematodes </li>
  <li>angular leaf spot of strawberry </li>
  <li>South American tomato moth</li>
  <li>fireblight</li>
</ul>
<p>Fireblight is a serious disease caused by the bacterium <em>Erwinia amylovora</em> which affects some fruit plants and ornamentals. It is a quarantine disease that is now widespread in the UK, due to its ability to move in planting material or aerially. </p>

<p>Fireblight can affect all aerial parts of the host, causing the death of flowers or young shoots, and there are no chemical measures to control it. Fireblight is a notifiable disease and statutory action is being taken to prevent its introduction and spread. </p>

<p>If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at <a href="mailto:planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk">planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>For more information, see pests and diseases in flowers and shrubs.</p>

<p>There are a large number of other pests and diseases that can affect your crops. You can find pests and diseases factsheets on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/pestsDiseases/"><abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr>’s Pest Risk Analysis (<abbr title="Pest Risk Analysis">PRA</abbr>) provides information on certain pests and diseases. It uses biological, scientific and economic evidence to determine action to be taken - and whether guidance should be published - for prevention. Some of the diseases it has produced guidance on are:</p>

<ul>
<li>dry bulb mites - affecting Alliums</li>
  <li>
<em>Alternaria</em> species - affecting various fruits and vegetables</li>
  <li>citrus longhorn beetle - affecting fruit trees</li>
  <li>Cercospora leaf blight - affecting carrots</li>
  <li>clover yellow mosaic virus - affecting various fruits</li>
</ul>
<p>Find <abbr title="Pest Risk Analysis">PRA</abbr> disease information on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/pestsDiseases/praTableNew.cfm"><abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>There are some diseases that affect fruit, vegetables and ornamentals. For more information on these pests and diseases, see pests and diseases in flowers and shrubs.</p>

<h2 id="potato-ring-rot-and-potato-brown-rot">Potato ring rot and potato brown rot</h2>

<p>Potato ring rot - <em>Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus</em> - and brown rot - <em>Ralstonia solanacearum</em> - are two serious bacterial diseases of potato which are difficult to tell apart. They are currently not established in the UK but are a large threat to the potato industry.</p>

<h3 id="potato-ring-rot">Potato ring rot</h3>

<p>This is a quarantine disease of potato that can cause huge yield loss - reported at up to 50 per cent. This loss occurs through the rotting of the tuber, leaving the crop inedible.</p>

<p>The disease can cause the plants to wilt but mostly affects the tuber. Symptoms are only visible when tubers are cut across the heel end, and may appear as:</p>

<ul>
<li>vascular tissue with a glassy, watersoaked appearance</li>
  <li>bacteria oozing from the vascular ring or eyes</li>
  <li>‘cheese-like’ rot of vascular ring</li>
  <li>later-stage internal hollowing and extensive tuber rot</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms occur at different rates in different varieties and are dependent on environmental conditions.</p>

<h3 id="potato-brown-rot">Potato brown rot</h3>

<p>Potato brown rot is very similar to potato ring rot in that it is a quarantine disease that destroys the tuber and causes yield loss.</p>

<p>As with potato ring rot, its symptoms can cause wilting in plants but it mostly affects the tuber. Symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>brown staining, in the initial stages, of the vascular ring that starts at the heel end</li>
  <li>creamy bacterial fluid oozing from cut vascular tissues</li>
  <li>completely rotten vascular tissues - in severe infections</li>
  <li>bacterial seeping from cut stems of infected plants - this can lead to the death of the whole plant</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spread-of-diseases">Spread of diseases</h3>

<p>Both diseases can be spread in a similar way - through infected seed potato tubers. This allows them to potentially pass through several generations without showing symptoms, and they can even be missed in laboratory tests - especially if the sample is small. The diseases can also be spread through:</p>

<ul>
<li>direct contact between healthy and diseased tubers</li>
  <li>the cutting, grading and handling of seed tubers - this allows the diseases to spread between potato stocks</li>
  <li>contaminated watercourses - eg flooding or irrigation</li>
  <li>contaminated potato waste</li>
  <li>waste dumping or contaminated farm equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>These are notifiable diseases. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at <a href="mailto:planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk">planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="prevention-and-treatment">Prevention and treatment</h3>

<p>Both diseases can be prevented and treated using the same methods, which are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>plant only classified seed - for more information, see the Seed Potato Classification Scheme (SPCS)</li>
  <li>irrigate with water that has not been contaminated - check for locally contaminated water sources</li>
  <li>control groundkeepers - potato groundkeeper control helps remove disease inoculum</li>
  <li>observe good hygiene - eg regularly clean and disinfect equipment and storage facilities used for potato production</li>
  <li>dispose of waste responsibly - poorly discarded potatoes and potato waste may contain the disease</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="potato-cyst-nematodes">Potato cyst nematodes</h2>

<p>Potato cyst nematodes (<abbr title="Potato cyst nematodes">PCNs</abbr>) - <em>Globodera rostochiensis</em> and <em>G. pallida</em> - are pests of potatoes that are damaging and widespread throughout the European Union (EU) and the UK. Though the main hosts for <abbr title="Potato cyst nematodes">PCNs</abbr> are potatoes, they can also attack other solanaceous plant species such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>tomatoes</li>
  <li>aubergines</li>
  <li>weeds - eg woody nightshade or bittersweet (<em>Solanum dulcamara</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each type of <abbr title="Potato cyst nematode">PCN</abbr> differs slightly in how it multiplies on potato cultivars.</p>

<p><abbr title="Potato cyst nematodes">PCNs</abbr> damage potato roots and can severely reduce yields even when symptoms are unapparent. Heavy infestations can seriously damage potato roots and kill off the plants entirely. Other common damage factors are:</p>

<ul>
<li>chlorotic and stunted plants</li>
  <li>
<em>Rhizoctonia</em> and other fungal diseases - which may occur in plants due to <abbr title="Potato cyst nematode">PCN</abbr> feeding</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="characteristics-and-symptoms">Characteristics and symptoms</h3>

<p><abbr title="Potato cyst nematodes">PCNs</abbr> are often identified by the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>juveniles and adults are less than one millimetre long, wormlike and transparent</li>
  <li>females swell as they get older, becoming spherical, and burst through root walls - the head remains embedded in the root</li>
  <li>swollen females are one millimetre in diameter, shiny, and white or cream coloured</li>
  <li>dead female bodies form hard, dark red-brown cysts - which contain between 200 and 600 eggs</li>
  <li>in severe infestations, cysts can be seen on the surface of tubers</li>
</ul>
<p>As cysts detach from the roots at harvesting, they can remain active in the soil - without a host - for seven years.</p>

<h3 id="control-measures">Control measures</h3>

<p>Directive 2007/33 concerns the detection and control of <abbr title="Potato cyst nematode">PCN</abbr>. Official investigations must be carried out before seed potatoes and certain plants, for replanting, are to be grown. An annual survey of ware potato fields is also required. </p>

<p>In the event of a positive finding from an official soil test, the <abbr title="Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate">PHSI</abbr> will demarcate the field and certain obligations are restrictions will apply in relation to that field. These include a prohibition on growing seed potatoes and a requirement to wash/brush or disinfest specified non-<abbr title="Potato cyst nematode">PCN</abbr> host plants that are harvested from the field. </p>

<p>Ware potatoes may be grown provided that a Control Programme is in place to suppress the levels of <abbr title="Potato cyst nematode">PCN</abbr> in the field. Find guidance on dealing with <abbr title="Potato cyst nematode">PCN</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/pestsDiseases/potatoCystNematodes.cfm"><abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>In addition to all existing certification and inspection requirements to prevent <abbr title="Potato cyst nematode">PCN</abbr> entering the seed potatoes system, as of 1 July 2010 the land in which seed potatoes are to be grown must undergo an official soil test prior to planting and meet other criteria. For more information see potatoes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Potato cyst nematodes">PCNs</abbr> are notifiable pests and are listed in the European Community plant health legislation. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at <a href="mailto:planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk">planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="angular-leaf-spot-of-strawberry">Angular leaf spot of strawberry</h2>

<p>Angular leaf spot (<em>Xanthomonas fragariae</em>) is a serious disease of strawberry which is listed in European Community plant health legislation, and has specific import and plant passport requirements.</p>

<p>It is found mainly on strawberry cultivars but also on other <em>Fragaria</em> and <em>Potentilla</em> species.</p>

<h3 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h3>

<p>Angular leaf spot produces noticeable symptoms from an early stage:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first symptoms are small, angular, watersoaked spots on the under surface of leaves</li>
  <li>these original spots turn reddish-brown and are often covered by slimy bacterial fluid - which dries to a scaly brown film</li>
  <li>large areas of necrotic tissue forms where the spots combine</li>
  <li>spots near the vein may visibly spread bacteria through it</li>
  <li>severe infections may spread to the crown tissue - crown infections can lead to plant death</li>
</ul>
<p>The disease can resist dehydration and can therefore survive in dry leaf debris and buried leaves. It can be transmitted through:</p>

<ul>
<li>water splash</li>
  <li>rain</li>
  <li>irrigation</li>
  <li>harvesting operations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="control">Control</h3>

<p>As angular leaf spot is not present in the UK, you must practise effective cultural crop control to prevent its introduction.</p>

<p>This is a notifiable disease. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at <a href="mailto:planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk">planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="south-american-tomato-moth">South American tomato moth</h2>

<p><em>Tuta absoluta</em> is a pest that affects tomatoes by mining into the leaves of the plant and burrowing into the fruit. It originated in South America and is now present in several areas of Southern Europe. So far, <em>Tuta absoluta</em> has only been found in the UK in tomatoes imported from infested areas in Spain.</p>

<p>A number of plants can host <em>Tuta absoluta</em>, including the:</p>

<ul>
<li>tomato - this is the pest’s preferred host and the leaves, stems and fruit are attacked by larvae</li>
  <li>potato - the larvae feed on the leaves only, not the tubers</li>
  <li>
<em>Solanaceae</em> family - larvae feed on the leaves of several species in this group but not the fruit</li>
</ul>
<p>Feeding damage is caused to the leaves and stems of tomatoes with larvae feeding on new growth. This affects the overall growth of the plant, even if the fruit is not attacked.</p>

<p>The fruit of the plant is usually only attacked when there is a heavy infestation of <em>Tuta absoluta</em>, but even small amounts of fruit damage will leave the fruit unsaleable. Secondary rot can also occur in wounds, leaving the fruit inedible.</p>

<p>In extreme instances, up to 100 per cent losses have been reported in tomato crops in other countries.</p>

<h3 id="symptoms-and-characteristics">Symptoms and characteristics</h3>

<p><em>Tuta absoluta</em> has many specific characteristics that you should look out for. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>its eggs are oval-cylindrical and cream-coloured - they can be located on the underside of leaves, on buds, or the calyxes of green fruit</li>
  <li>its larvae are white or cream with a black head early on - they turn pink or green with a brown head as they grow older</li>
  <li>the prothoracic shield behind the head develops paler patches in later instars</li>
  <li>the adult moths are around seven millimetres long and are a brown or silver colour with black spots on the narrow wings</li>
</ul>
<p>Larval species identification can be made from leaf mines and are often easily recognised. Other <em>Tuta absoluta</em> larvae signs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>blotch leaf mine visible on both sides of the leaf</li>
  <li>dark excrement visible in leaf mines</li>
  <li>several mines on a single leaf</li>
  <li>green or red fruit being attacked</li>
  <li>visible surface holes in fruit from tunnelling</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in controlled crops, losses can be up to 5 per cent.</p>

<h3 id="prevention-and-control">Prevention and control</h3>

<p>There are three insecticide ingredients that are effective against <em>Tuta absoluta</em> which can be used in the UK:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki</em></li>
  <li>indoxacarb</li>
  <li>spinosad</li>
</ul>
<p>Pheromone-baited water traps can work effectively on low population densities and pheromone traps can catch male moths.</p>

<p>This is a notifiable pest. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at <a href="mailto:planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk">planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="plum-pox">Plum pox</h2>

<p>Plum pox disease - also known as Sharka - is caused by the Plum pox virus and affects many species of <em>Prunus</em>, including plums, damsons, greengages, apricots, peaches, almonds and cherries. The disease is widespread throughout the European Union and can cause:</p>

<ul>
<li>a reduction of the yield of a tree by 20-30 per cent</li>
  <li>severe pock-marking of fruit</li>
  <li>fruit being unsaleable</li>
  <li>economic losses - through premature fruit drop, low sugar content, poor flavour and reduced shelf life</li>
</ul>
<p>The disease can spread in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>on infected rootstocks or through the use of infected budwood, or the planting of infected trees - this allows the rapid movement of the disease throughout the country</li>
  <li>by aphids from infected trees or hosts</li>
</ul>
<p>The disease develops slowly and usually only affects one or two branches initially. It then spreads through the tree over several years as the tree develops.</p>

<h3 id="symptoms-1">Symptoms</h3>

<p>There are varying symptoms depending on the host, the variety of species and where it is located, and the season. The most common symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>pale green or yellow chlorotic spots, blotches, bands or line patterns on plum leaves</li>
  <li>dark fruits show blue necrotic rings, which may be sunken</li>
  <li>pale fruits show uneven ripening, blotching and rings</li>
  <li>peach leaves are distorted when they unfold with pale green or yellow flecks on veins</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>

<p>If you find that trees used for propagation are infected, they must be grubbed. This is under statutory notice, as there is no other effective control measure.</p>

<p>To prevent outbreaks and reduce the risk of disease spread, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>use certified planting material</li>
  <li>remove wild hosts and try to control aphids on holdings</li>
  <li>ensure all susceptible material intended for planting is officially certified or tested and found to be free of the disease</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a notifiable pest. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at <a href="mailto:planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk">planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="spodoptera">Spodoptera</h2>

<p>Several moths of the genus Spodoptera are recognised as quarantine pests. It is a destructive agricultural pest and could potentially spread to glasshouse crops in northern Europe.</p>

<p><em>Spodoptera littoralis</em> is the species most commonly intercepted in the UK. The caterpillars feed on a wide range of plants - including vegetable and fruit crops. The populations are also highly resistant to pesticides and are difficult to control.</p>

<p>The caterpillars can chew holes in plant leaves and can completely defoliate plants if there is a sufficient population. They can also damage stems, buds, flowers and fruits.</p>

<p>Spodoptera variations can be recognised by the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>eggs are laid in batches on plants, pots, benches or glasshouse structures and the masses are covered with brown hairs</li>
  <li>caterpillars are two to three millimetres long when hatching and have white bodies and black heads</li>
  <li>later stages of the caterpillar can vary from light to dark brown, and the body is strongly speckled with tiny white spots</li>
  <li>red-brown pupae form in a loose cocoon under the surface of the soil of the host</li>
  <li>adult moths are up to two centimetres long with brown forewings with pale cream streaks and dashes, and translucent white hindwings</li>
</ul>
<p>Caterpillars also have the following distinctive markings:</p>

<ul>
<li>four yellow spots, each on a black patch - just behind the head</li>
  <li>black patches just behind the yellow spots, with another pair of black patches at the end of the caterpillar</li>
  <li>three orange-brown lines along the back of the body</li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent the spread of Spodoptera you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure your suppliers’ plants are free from this pest, and include it in a commercial contract if necessary</li>
  <li>inspect new plants and produce on arrival for eggs, caterpillars and any signs of damage</li>
  <li>notify your local Plant Health and Seed Inspectorate as soon as possible of the presence of the pest, to allow early implementation of a treatment programme</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="treatments">Treatments</h3>

<p>You can use light or pheromone traps for monitoring purposes. As adults are nocturnal, these can also be used for trapping.</p>

<p>This is a notifiable pest. If you believe the disease may be on your premises you should immediately contact the <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> Plant Health and Seed Inspectors Division on 01904 465 625 or email them at <a href="mailto:planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk">planthealth.info@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="melon-thrips">Melon thrips</h2>

<p>Melon thrips - also called <em>Thrips palmi</em> - is a notifiable pest that can damage a variety of crops, particularly:</p>

<ul>
<li>cucumber</li>
  <li>aubergine</li>
  <li>tomato</li>
  <li>sweet pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>A severe infestation of thrips can kill entire plants. It also carries other viruses and can spread non-indigenous plant viruses, such as the tomato spotted wilt virus.</p>

<p>It is often introduced through the importing of orchid flowers and has now spread throughout Asia, the Pacific and the US. Introduction of thrips into the UK could lead to the spread of further viruses which are not already established.</p>

<h3 id="symptoms-and-characteristics-1">Symptoms and characteristics</h3>

<p>All thrips are difficult to detect and plants need to be checked regularly for feeding damage indicators. They can often be confused with onion thrips or western flower thrips which can be found throughout the UK.</p>

<p>Thrips feed by sucking the cell contents from leaves, stems, flowers and the surface of fruits. This shows up as visible silver scars and leaf chlorosis. Plant growth can also be deformed and heavily scarred.</p>

<p>Melon thrips often show the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>they are around one millimetre long</li>
  <li>their bodies are entirely yellow with a dark longitudinal line where its wings join when resting</li>
  <li>their eggs will not be visible as they are laid within the plant tissue</li>
  <li>nymphal thrips are yellow to pale orange and look like adults without wings - however, they look similar to other indigenous thrips at this stage</li>
  <li>nymphs feed on aerial parts of plants and drop to the soil to pupate</li>
  <li>pupae are a similar colour to nymphs, however they are often covered by soil</li>
  <li>adults return to the aerial parts of the plant to feed and lay eggs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevention-1">Prevention</h3>

<p>To prevent the spread of melon thrips you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure your suppliers’ plants are free from this pest, and include it in a commercial contract if necessary</li>
  <li>check any known hosts are treated before import</li>
  <li>keep importing material for growing on separate until it is confirmed free from melon thrips and any symptoms</li>
  <li>use sticky blue traps and check regularly for presence of any thrips genus</li>
  <li>do not combine ornamental and vegetable crops in the same growing area, as this minimises potential virus spread and helps control programmes</li>
  <li>notify the Plant Health and Seed Inspectorate as soon as possible of the presence of the pest - to allow early implementation of a treatment programme</li>
</ul>
