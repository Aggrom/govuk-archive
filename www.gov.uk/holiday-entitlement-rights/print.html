</header><article id="entitlement"><header><h1>Part 1: Entitlement</h1>
  </header><p>Almost all workers are legally entitled to 5.6 weeks <a href="/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics" title="Holiday pay">paid holiday</a> per year (known as statutory leave entitlement or annual leave). </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Self-employed workers aren’t entitled to annual leave.</p>
</div>

<h2>Working 5 days a week</h2>

<p>Most workers who work a 5-day week, must receive 28 days paid annual leave per year. This is calculated by multiplying a normal week (5 days) by the annual entitlement of 5.6 weeks.  </p>

<h2>Working part-time</h2>

<p>Part-time workers are also entitled to a minimum of 5.6 weeks of paid holiday each year, although this may amount to fewer actual days of paid holiday than a full-time worker would get.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
A worker works 3 days a week, their leave is calculated by multiplying 3 by 5.6 which comes to 16.8 days of annual paid leave.</p>
</div>

<h2>Irregular hours</h2>

<p>If someone works irregular hours - eg shift work - they need to <a href="/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement" title="Calculate your holiday entitlement">calculate their leave entitlement for irregular hours</a>. </p>

<h2>Limits on statutory leave</h2>

<p>The maximum amount of paid statutory leave a worker can have over one leave year is 28 days. This also applies to staff who work a 6-day week.</p>

<h2>Bank holidays</h2>

<p><a href="/bank-holidays" title="Find out when UK bank and public holidays are">Bank or public holidays</a> do not have to be given as paid leave. An employer can choose to include these holidays as part of a worker’s statutory annual leave.</p>

<h2>Extra leave</h2>

<p>An employer can choose to offer more leave than the legal minimum. They don’t have to apply all the rules that apply to statutory leave to the extra leave. For example, a worker might need to be employed for a certain amount of time before they become entitled to it. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement" title="Calculate your statutory leave">statutory leave calculator</a> to work out a worker’s leave.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other aspects of holiday entitlement</h2>

<p>Workers have the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li>get <a href="/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics" title="Holiday pay">paid</a> for leave</li>
  <li>build up holiday entitlement during maternity, paternity and adoption leave</li>
  <li>build up holiday entitlement while off work sick  </li>
  <li>choose to take holiday instead of <a href="/taking-sick-leave" title="Taking sick leave">sick leave</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Disputes</h2>

<p>Paid annual leave is a legal right that an employer must provide. If a worker thinks their right to leave and pay are not being met there are a number of ways to <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="Solve a workplace dispute">resolve the dispute</a>.</p>

</article><article id="holiday-pay-the-basics"><header><h1>Part 2: Holiday pay: the basics</h1>
  </header><p>Workers are entitled to a week’s pay for each week of leave they take. </p>

<p>A week’s pay is worked out according to the kind of hours a worker works and how they’re paid for the hours.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Working pattern</th>
      <th>Pay</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fixed hours and fixed pay</td>
      <td>A week’s holiday pay equals how much a worker gets for a week’s work (excluding non-guaranteed overtime payments in most cases)</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Shift work with fixed hours</td>
      <td>A week’s holiday pay equals the average number of weekly fixed hours a worker worked in the previous 12 weeks at their average hourly rate</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>No fixed hours</td>
      <td>A week’s holiday pay is the average pay a worker got over the previous 12 weeks (in which they were paid)</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Calculating average hourly rate</h2>

<p>To calculate average hourly rate, only the hours worked and how much was paid for them should be counted. Take the average rate over the last 12 weeks. If no pay was paid in any week, count back a further week, so that the rate is based on 12 weeks in which pay was paid.   </p>

<h2>Rolled-up holiday pay</h2>

<p>Holiday pay should be paid for the time when annual leave is taken. An employer cannot include an amount for holiday pay in the hourly rate (known as ‘rolled-up holiday pay’). If a current contract still includes rolled-up pay, it needs to be re-negotiated.</p>

<p>This is a general guide and doesn’t cover every type of working arrangement or all scenarios. For specific information about your holiday pay entitlement, contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (<abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr>).</p>

</article><article id="calculate-leave-entitlement"><header><h1>Part 3: Calculate leave entitlement</h1>
  </header><p>Annual leave begins to build up (‘accrue’) as soon as a worker starts their job.</p>

<p>An employer can use a ‘leave year’ or an ‘accrual’ system to work out how much leave their staff should get. </p>

<h2>Leave year</h2>

<p>An employer must usually tell their staff the dates of their statutory leave year as soon as they start working, eg it might run from 1 January to 31 December. </p>

<p>Workers must take their statutory leave during this time. If a leave year isn’t set out in a contract then it will start: </p>

<ul>
<li>on the 1st day of a new job (if started after 1 October 1998)</li>
  <li>on 1 October (if started on or before 1 October 1998)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Leave entitlement when starting a new job</h3>

<p>If a worker starts their job part-way through a leave year, they’re only entitled to part of their total annual leave for the current leave year. What they get depends on how much of the year is left. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement" title="calculate your holiday entitlement">holiday entitlement calculator</a> to work out how much leave someone has left.</p>
</div>

<h2>Accrual system</h2>

<p>An employer can use an accrual system to work out a worker’s leave during the first year of the job. Under this system, a worker gets one twelfth of their leave in each month. So by the 3rd month they’d be entitled to a quarter of of their total leave, eg 7 days out of 28 for a 5-day week.</p>

<h2>Carrying over leave</h2>

<p>Workers don’t have an automatic right to carry over leave they haven’t taken but in some cases they may be able to. </p>

<p>A worker working 5 days a week, can carry over up to 8 days leave out of the 28 day entitlement to the next year, if this is written in their contract.</p>

<p>If a worker gets more than 28 days’ leave, their employer may allow them to carry over any additional untaken leave. Check the employment contract, company handbook or intranet site to see what the rules say.</p>

<p>If a worker can’t take leave because of being on some other type of leave (for example, sick leave or maternity leave), they may be able to carry-over some or all of the untaken leave into the next leave year.</p>

<p>In sickness cases, employers may not be required to allow workers to carry over the additional statutory leave which exceeds the 4 week entitlement.</p>


</article><article id="booking-timeoff"><header><h1>Part 4: Booking time-off </h1>
  </header><p>The general notice period for taking leave is at least twice as long as the amount of leave a worker wants to take (eg 2 day’s notice for 1 day’s leave) unless the contract says something different.</p>

<p>An employer can refuse a leave request but they must give as much notice as the amount of leave requested, eg 2 weeks notice if the leave requested was 2 weeks.  </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Although employers can refuse to give leave at a certain time, they can’t refuse to let workers take the leave at all.</p>
</div>

<h2>Part leave days</h2>

<p>Some workers may be entitled to a part leave day -  eg if they’re part-time or have a half day’s leave to take. How a part day should be taken is up to the employer.</p>

<h2>When leave can and can’t be taken</h2>

<p>Employers can: </p>

<ul>
<li>tell their staff to take leave, eg bank holidays or Christmas </li>
  <li>restrict when leave can be taken, eg at certain busy periods </li>
</ul>
<p>There may be rules about this in the employment contract or it may be what normally happens in the workplace. The notice period for this is at least twice as long as the leave they want their staff to take.</p>

</article><article id="taking-holiday-before-leaving-a-job"><header><h1>Part 5: Taking holiday before leaving a job</h1>
  </header><p>During their <a href="/handing-in-your-notice" title="Handing in your notice">notice period</a> the worker may be able to take whatever is left of their statutory annual leave. </p>

<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement" title="calculate your holiday entitlement">holiday entitlement calculator</a> to work this out. How much they get depends on how much of the holiday year has passed. </p>

<h2>Taking more leave than the entitlement</h2>

<p>If a worker has taken more leave than they’re entitled to, their employer must not take money from their final pay unless it’s been agreed beforehand in writing. The rules in this situation should be outlined in the employment contract, company handbook or intranet site. </p>

<h2>Getting paid instead of taking holidays</h2>

<p>The only time someone can get paid in place of taking statutory leave (known as ‘payment in lieu’) is when they leave their job. Employers must pay for untaken statutory leave (even if the worker is dismissed for gross misconduct).</p>

<p>If an employer offers more than 5.6 weeks annual leave, they can agree separate arrangements for the extra leave.</p>
