<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The European Fisheries Fund (<abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>) provides grant funding for processing and marketing of aquaculture and fishery products. Grants are only available if your business is under a certain size and will only cover eligible costs. If your business is micro, small or medium-sized you will be able to get funding to cover up to 40% of eligible costs. Other applicants can get up to 20%, or up to 40% if the project has particular benefits.</p>

<p>When you apply for a grant under the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, you need to include a detailed business plan. If your application is successful, you will be expected to meet certain conditions and targets to get paid.</p>

<p>This guide sets out the projects that can be funded by <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> grants and the costs that are eligible. It also explains who can get grant aid, how to apply and how much you will get if your application is successful.</p>

<h2 id="businesses-that-can-apply-for-a-grant">Businesses that can apply for a grant</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> provides grant funding for the processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products in the public or private sector.</p>

<h3 id="the-grants-purpose">The grant’s purpose</h3>

<p>The grants aim to encourage innovation and capital investment in fish processing. The grants provide support to projects that add quality and value to the industry, including modernising premises or production methods and improving hygiene.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-investment-the-grant-funds">Types of investment the grant funds</h3>

<p>Grants will be given for capital investment in production facilities - used between the time of landing or harvesting and the end product stage - but not at retail level. For example, funding may be used for a new marketing establishment. The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> focuses on funding projects that aim to:</p>

<ul>
<li>improve working conditions</li>
  <li>improve and monitor public health and hygiene conditions or product quality</li>
  <li>produce high quality products for niche markets</li>
  <li>reduce negative impact on the environment</li>
  <li>promote the use of little-known species</li>
  <li>improve the use of by-products and waste</li>
  <li>produce or market new products, apply new technologies or develop innovative production methods</li>
  <li>market products from local landings and aquaculture</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p>Grant aid is available to:</p>

<ul>
<li>micro, small or medium-sized businesses, who can get up to 40% of eligible costs</li>
  <li>businesses with fewer than 750 employees and a turnover of less than €200 million, who can get up to 20% of eligible costs or 40% if the project has high quality or environmental benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>For your business to be classed as micro, small or medium-sized you need to look at the number of staff it has, and its annual turnover or balance sheet total.</p>

<h3 id="business-size-thresholds">Business size thresholds</h3>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Enterprise category</th>
      <th>Staff head count</th>
      <th>Turnover</th>
      <th>Balance sheet total</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Micro</td>
      <td>Up to ten</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €2 million</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €2 million</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Small</td>
      <td>Up to 50</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €10 million</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €10 million</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Medium-sized</td>
      <td>Up to 250</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €50 million</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €43 million</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When you compare your business against these thresholds, you always have to use the staff head count. But you can choose whether to meet either the annual turnover or the balance sheet total ceiling. You don’t have to meet both ceilings, and the one that you choose not to meet can be higher than the ceiling without your business losing its status.</p>

<p>It’s also a good idea to speak to your Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) local area facilitator for guidance on which items are eligible. <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/eff_apply.htm">Find contact details for local area facilitators on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="the-amount-of-grant-aid-thats-available">The amount of grant aid that’s available</h2>

<p>Grant aid is awarded to projects that give the best value for money. The scheme is competitive so there’s no guarantee that your project will qualify for funding.</p>

<p>If your application is successful you will receive a percentage of the total eligible cost of your project. The minimum amount of grant funding is £400 and the maximum is £300,000. You will only receive grant funding once you have spent money on your project.</p>

<p>Micro, small and medium-sized businesses and projects with high quality or environmental benefits can get up to 40% of eligible costs. Other applicants can get up to 20%. For business size thresholds, see the page in this guide on who can apply for a grant.</p>

<h3 id="grant-funding-conditions">Grant funding conditions</h3>

<p>You can only receive grant aid on your project from one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> fund. You’ll need to confirm on the application form that you haven’t applied for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> funding under a different scheme.</p>

<p>Your project must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK legislation. You must also have a funding package which includes match funding from UK public money administered by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>, as well as from private funds.</p>

<h3 id="the-offer-letter">The offer letter</h3>

<p>If your application succeeds you will receive an offer letter from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>. This is a mutual agreement between you and the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> and sets out details of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the conditions attached to the offer of the grant - these are based on the general conditions of the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> and may also include some that are specific to your project</li>
  <li>the agreed performance targets and outputs of the project</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to meet these conditions and targets or the grant will not be paid. For full details of the general conditions of the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/forms/eff/ax2-prm001_guidance.pdf">download the eligibility guidance notes from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 136KB).</a></p>

<p>When you get the offer letter, check it carefully, sign one copy and return to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> within four weeks or the offer will expire.</p>

<h2 id="write-your-business-case">Write your business case</h2>

<p>Applications for processing and marketing grants have to include a detailed business case that demonstrates your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>has measurable outputs and clear and achievable targets</li>
  <li>will provide an additional and sustainable benefit to the fishing industry</li>
  <li>has a justified need for a grant</li>
  <li>will provide good value for money</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="full-description-of-the-project">Full description of the project</h3>

<p>You need to set out:</p>

<ul>
<li>a full description of your project, including how it will operate and be carried out</li>
  <li>a business case to show your project is technically and economically possible</li>
</ul>
<p>If your application covers more than one phase, you need to give precise timings for each phase. You may need to include a separate business case for each phase. Explain why the work is needed and how any problems will be addressed.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-the-project">Benefits of the project</h3>

<p>You will have to quantify the benefits of your project and give details of how you calculated them. Your application needs to show how the project will contribute to a wide variety of factors, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating jobs and sustaining existing employment</li>
  <li>improving supply chain and operating efficiency</li>
  <li>creating value from new markets or products</li>
  <li>reducing waste</li>
  <li>promoting sustainability</li>
  <li>supporting diversification</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need to show how the benefits of the project will continue after the grant support comes to an end.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-impact-assessment">Environmental impact assessment</h3>

<p>Where necessary, you must carry out an environmental impact assessment and include a copy with your application for grant aid.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-of-quotes">Analysis of quotes</h3>

<p>You will need to get a set minimum number of quotes from suppliers. The number depends on the value of your project. You should include copies of these quotes with your application.</p>

<h3 id="expected-results">Expected results</h3>

<p>If your application for grant aid is successful, the offer letter will include certain targets and conditions based on your business plan. Make sure you provide accurate specific details of your expected results and timescales.</p>

<h3 id="publicity-monitoring-and-risk-management">Publicity, monitoring and risk management</h3>

<p>You need to provide details of how you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>publicise the project, including the compulsory publicity for projects over €500,000</li>
  <li>monitor the project</li>
  <li>manage your risks while you’re delivering the project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="information-about-your-business">Information about your business</h3>

<p>You have to provide financial information about your business, as well as details of your experience of running similar projects.</p>

<p>For further details about what to include in your business case, <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/forms/eff/economic_appraisal_guidance.pdf">download guidance on compiling a business case and an economic appraisal from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 116KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="apply-for-a-grant">Apply for a grant</h2>

<p>You need to use form <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>-AX2-IPM001 to apply for a <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> processing and marketing grant. You can download this from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website. <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> local area facilitators can help you with the application process if you have any queries. There are also eligibility guidance notes available to download from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website to help you fill in the application form.</p>

<h3 id="projects-that-cover-more-than-one-uk-country">Projects that cover more than one UK country</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> only deals with applications from England. Applications for the rest of the UK are dealt with by the relevant devolved administration. But if your project covers more than one country in the UK, you only need to make a single application to the administration where your business is based. If you’re based outside England, the administration you apply to will contact the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> for a decision on who will lead the project and where the funding will come from.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/eff_apply.htm">find forms, application advice and contact details for local area facilitators on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>
