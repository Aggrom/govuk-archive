  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If your employee has a concern or problem that they haven’t been able to resolve informally, they may make a formal grievance complaint to you.</p>

<p>Businesses must have a <a href="/handling-employee-grievance/grievance-procedure" title="written grievance procedure">written grievance procedure</a> in place and share it with all employees. It must say how the process works and how long it takes.</p>

<p>After a <a href="/handling-employee-grievance/grievance-hearing" title="grievance hearing">hearing</a> of the evidence, you should let the employee know your decision in writing. If they aren’t happy with the decision, they can <a href="/handling-employee-grievance/employers-decisions-and-appeals" title="Appeal">appeal</a>. </p>

</article><article id="grievance-procedure"><header><h1>Part 2: Grievance procedure</h1>
  </header><p>By law employers must set out a grievance procedure and share it in writing with all employees, eg in their statement of employment or staff handbook. It must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>who the employee should contact about a grievance</li>
  <li>how to contact this person</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also:</p>

<ul>
<li>say that if the problem can’t be resolved informally, there will be a meeting with the employee, called a grievance hearing</li>
  <li>set out time limits for each stage of the process </li>
  <li>identify who to contact if the normal contact person is involved in the grievance</li>
  <li>explain how to appeal a grievance decision</li>
  <li>state that employees can be accompanied in any meetings by a colleague or union representative</li>
  <li>outline what happens if a grievance is raised during disciplinary action</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to include information about the grievance procedure in employment contracts. However, if you do, you must follow the procedure, or the employee could bring a breach of contract claim against you.</p>

<h2>Acas Code of Practice</h2>

<p>The Acas Code of Practice isn’t legally binding. However, an employment tribunal can reduce or increase any money awarded in a case by up to 25% if the code hasn’t been followed.</p>

</article><article id="grievance-hearing"><header><h1>Part 3: The grievance hearing</h1>
  </header><h2>Preparing for the hearing</h2>

<p>Before holding a hearing, employers should:</p>

<ul>
<li>give the employee notice so that they can prepare their case </li>
  <li>carry out out a full investigation if necessary and take statements from any witnesses who cannot attend</li>
  <li>make it clear that the employee can bring a colleague or union representative if they want to</li>
  <li>arrange for another manager to attend to make sure that the hearing is conducted properly</li>
  <li>arrange for someone to take notes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Delays</h2>

<p>If the employee cannot attend the hearing (eg because they are ill), offer them a reasonable alternative date and time. </p>

<p>The employee can also suggest a different time for the hearing if the person accompanying them cannot attend. They must do this within 5 working days after you proposed the original meeting time. </p>

<p>You can make your decision without having a hearing if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have already rearranged the meeting, but the employee fails to attend</li>
  <li>the employee is on long-term sick leave and unable to go to meetings in the near future (they can supply written information instead if they want to) </li>
</ul></article><article id="employers-decisions-and-appeals"><header><h1>Part 4: Employers' decisions and appeals</h1>
  </header><h2>After the hearing</h2>

<p>You should give the employee a copy of the meeting records. You may be able to leave out some information in certain circumstances (eg to protect a witness).</p>

<p>After you have decided the action to take, write to the parties involved, setting out:</p>

<ul>
<li>your decision and the reasons behind it</li>
  <li>the appeals process and deadline</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If there are any delays during the appeal process, it’s important that you tell the employee as soon as possible.</p>
</div>

<h2>Appeals</h2>

<p>If the employee appeals, there should be another hearing to re-examine the decision. The process is the same as the original hearing but you should also look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>the reasoning behind the appeal</li>
  <li>any new evidence</li>
</ul>
<p>If possible, the appeal should not be heard by the same person who held the original hearing. </p>

<p>After the appeal hearing, you should set out your decision in writing and state that this is the final outcome.</p>
