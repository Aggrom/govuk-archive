  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If a car is written off by an insurance company, they will usually tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> so that a ‘<abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> marker’ (Vehicle Identity Check marker) can be put on the vehicle record. </p>

<p>If you own or buy the car, having a <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> marker means you can’t get a replacement registration certificate and you won’t be sent the V11 vehicle licence reminder you use to renew your tax disc. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To remove the <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> marker the car needs to pass a <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> test.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> test compares the details <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> has about the car against the car itself. It takes place at a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> (Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> test centre.</p>

<p>You’ll need to know the car’s make and registration mark.</p>

</article><article id="taking-your-car-for-a-vic-test"><header><h1>Part 5: Taking your car for a VIC test</h1>
  </header><p>When you take your vehicle for a Vehicle Identity Check (<abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr>) test the following must apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the car must be roadworthy and able to be driven under its own power</li>
  <li>the car must have a valid MOT if it needs one (if you’re driving it to the <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the person driving the car must be insured</li>
  <li>the car must have front and rear number plates (if you’re driving it to the test)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get more information on the <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> test in the ‘Application for a Vehicle Identity Check’.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/repository/Application%20for%20a%20Vehicle%20Identity%20Check%20%28VIC%201%29.pdf" title="Download VIC1 ‘Application for a Vehicle Identity Check’ (PDF, 262KB)">Download ‘VIC1 - Application for a Vehicle Identity Check’ (PDF, 262KB)</a></p>
</div>

<p>The test takes about 20 minutes and is a check of the car’s identity, not the quality of its repairs.</p>

<p>However, if the <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> inspector notices a serious defect which would make the car dangerous to drive they may issue a ‘prohibition notice’. This means the car can’t be driven until it’s made roadworthy and the prohibition notice is removed. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can drive your car directly to and from a <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> without a tax disc.</p>
</div>

<h2>If your car passes its <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You’ll get a VIC20 pass certificate and <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will be told automatically.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> marker will then be taken off your vehicle record and the V5C registration certificate will be marked to show ‘substantially repaired and/or accident damaged; identity checked on dd/mm/ccyy’.</p>

<h2>If your car fails its <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You’ll get a <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> failure notice (VIC21) with the reasons for failure.</p>

<p>The case will then be investigated by the police or <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> - this may take several weeks.</p>

<p>If the car’s identity is then confirmed you’ll get your VIC20 pass certificate.</p>

<p>If the car’s identity can’t be confirmed the <abbr title="Vehicle Identity Check">VIC</abbr> marker will remain on the vehicle record.</p>
