</ul></article><article id="employer-checks-and-record-keeping"><header><h1>Part 3: Employer checks and record keeping</h1>
  </header><p>It’s a criminal offence for employers not to pay someone the National Minimum Wage or to falsify payment records.</p>

<p>Employers who discover they have paid a worker below the minimum wage must pay any arrears immediately.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Use the <a href="/am-i-getting-minimum-wage" title="National Minimum Wage Calculator">National Minimum Wage calculator</a> to work out arrears.</p>
</div>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) officers have the right to carry out checks at any time and ask to see payment records. They can also investigate employers, following a worker’s complaint to them.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> finds that an employer hasn’t been paying the correct rates, any arrears have to be paid back immediately. There will also be a penalty. </p>

<p>It’s the employer’s responsibility to keep records proving that they are paying the minimum wage - most employers use their payroll records as proof. All records have to be kept for 3 years. </p>


</article><article id="worker-disputes-over-minimum-wage"><header><h1>Part 4: Worker disputes over minimum wage</h1>
  </header><p>Workers who think their pay is below the minimum wage rate should talk to their employer first.</p>

<p>If this doesn’t solve the problem, they can ask the employer in writing to see their payment records. The worker can take someone with them and make copies of the records.</p>

<p>If an employer owes the worker any arrears they have to pay these back.</p>

<p>Workers can also call the confidential helpline to help them solve a payment dispute.</p>

<h2>If the employer refuses payment</h2>
<p>If HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) find that the employer hasn’t paid they will send them a notice for the arrears plus a penalty for not paying the minimum wage. </p>

<p>If the employer still refuses to pay <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can take them to court on behalf of the worker</p>
