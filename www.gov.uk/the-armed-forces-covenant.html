<h2 id="what-is-the-armed-forces-covenant">What is the armed forces covenant?</h2>

<p>The covenant sets out the relationship between the nation, the state and the armed forces. It recognises that the whole nation has a moral obligation to members of the armed forces and their families and it establishes how they should expect to be treated.</p>

<p>It exists to redress the disadvantages that the armed forces community faces in comparison to other citizens, and to recognise sacrifices made. In some cases this will require special consideration, especially for those who have given the most, such as the injured and the bereaved.</p>

<p>Since the armed forces covenant was published in May 2011, the government and our partner charities and voluntary organisations have been very busy. We’ve delivered on a number of commitments, introduced the community covenant (with a £30 million grant scheme to support it) and produced the first statutory annual report on our progress and where disadvantages remain. </p>

<p>The principle behind the covenant is that the armed forces community should not face disadvantage because of its military experience. In some cases, such as the sick, injured or bereaved, this means giving special consideration to enable access to public or commercial services that civilians wouldn’t receive. The covenant covers issues from housing and education to support after service. It is crucial to the government that it, and the nation, recognise the unique and immense sacrifices the armed forces community makes.</p>

<h2 id="minister-responsible-for-the-covenant">Minister responsible for the covenant</h2>

<p>The armed forces covenant is a matter for the whole of government and therefore the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/prime-minister" title="Prime minister, David Cameron MP">Prime Minister</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/Deputy-Prime-Minister" title="Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg MP">Deputy Prime Minister</a> agreed to establish a new ministerial committee. This is led by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/minister-of-state-cabinet-office-providing-policy-to-the-prime-minister-in-the-cabinet-office" title="Minister of State for Government Policy, Oliver Letwin">Minister for Government Policy</a>, Oliver Letwin, to oversee the covenant programme of work and ensure that momentum is maintained, working closely with the Covenant Reference Group. The first meeting was on 2 February 2012 and was chaired by the Prime Minister.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="commitments-delivered">Commitments delivered</h2>

<h3 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are investing up to £15 million in prosthetics provision for personnel who have lost limbs during service. The funding will support commissioning specialist prosthetic and rehabilitation services for amputee veterans through a number of multi-disciplinary centres in England.</li>
  <li>We endorsed proposals for improvements in mental health care provision, most of which have been implemented already. These include an extension of access to mental health care to six months after discharge, an increase in the number of veterans’ mental health nurses, a 24 hour helpline and a support and advice website.</li>
  <li>There is ongoing work to gain professional recognition for military medical qualifications, in particular for combat medical technicians and medical assistants. The next stage is to clarify the requirement, which will need to reflect the different environments of each service.
*An e-learning package has been delivered to educate GPs in how best to support veterans’ healthcare needs. This includes raising awareness of the reservists mental health programme.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have delivered a scheme to provide scholarships to bereaved Service children. As of October 2011 a total of 22 Further Education and 61 Higher Education scholarships have been awarded for academic years 2010/2011 and 2011/12.</li>
  <li>We have delivered more help for those leaving the service to go on to higher / further education – not least through payment of tuition fees, which has been extended to the spouses or partners taking up the entitlement because of bereavement or extreme injury of a discharged service person.</li>
  <li>We have introduced the Pupil Premium for the children of those currently serving (£200 per child), amounting to £9 million for 2011/12 (for 2012/13 this will be increased to £250, meaning service children will benefit from around an extra £11 million). In addition, we have made available £3 million per year for state schools with service children (including those of reservists). Since the launch of this fund, 139 bids from schools have been approved, amounting to £2.9 million for this financial year.</li>
  <li>Schools can now exceed the 30 pupil limit for infant classes in order to accommodate service children.</li>
  <li>A service child indicator is now part of the Annual School Census in England and DFE is now able to identify separately the children of parents in the Armed Forces.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>

<ul>
<li>In England members of the armed forces are being placed at the top of the priority list for the government’s £500 million FirstBuy scheme, which is designed to help first time buyers; and at the top of the priority list for all other government-funded home ownership schemes. The first FirstBuy purchase by a Service person has now taken place. This priority lasts for up to 12 months after active service ends. In the event of a death in service the priority passes to the bereaved spouse or civil partner.</li>
  <li>Our support to the Armed Forces Home Ownership Scheme continues: the pilot AFHOS scheme was a huge success in the first of its agreed 4 years of operation, with the agreed funding being used in full.</li>
  <li>Service personnel are now able to apply for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/defence-infrastructure-organisation-service-family-accommodation" title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation: service families accomodation (SFA)">service families accommodation</a> online.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pay-and-benefits">Pay and benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are continuing to provide a minimum £250 increase for the lowest ranks in the Armed Forces during the 2 year public sector pay freeze.</li>
  <li>Council Tax Relief has been doubled twice by government and now stands at nearly £600 per service person for a six month deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>

<ul>
<li>We have doubled the Families Welfare Grant.</li>
  <li>We improved Rest and Recuperation leave for those on operations.</li>
  <li>We doubled the tax free Operational Allowance so that those serving on eligible operations now receive a lump sum of just over £5,000 for a six month tour.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-after-service">Support after service</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous automatic entitlement to Blue Badges is in place for seriously injured service personnel and veterans</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> has launched a new charity portal for veterans with a link to a dedicated full page of information on each organisation, including services provided and details of how to contact them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="commercial-products">Commercial products</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are working with credit reference agencies to ensure service people are not disadvantaged by mobility requirements in accessing credit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background-to-the-covenant">Background to the covenant</h2>

<p>The idea of a mutual obligation between the nation and its armed forces goes back centuries – a 1593 statute of Elizabeth I called for a weekly tax so that disabled army veterans: “should at their return be relieved and rewarded to the end that they may reap the fruit of their good deservings, and others may be encouraged to perform the like endeavours”.</p>

<p>It was not until 2000 that the phrase ‘military covenant’ was first used, in a publication that details the moral basis for what the Army does. It explains how ‘unlimited liability’ makes soldiering a unique activity and it clarifies what soldiers should expect in return for forfeiting some of their civil liberties.</p>

<p>When the Coalition government came into office in 2010 it made a commitment to rebuild the covenant. The covenant was re-named the ‘armed forces covenant’ to include all three services.</p>

<p>The covenant covers issues from housing and education to support after service and in it veterans have great importance. It is crucial to the government that it, and the nation, recognises the unique and immense sacrifices that has been made for our country.</p>
