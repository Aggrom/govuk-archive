You can use it if you're [using the CSA](/arranging-child-maintenance-through-the-child-support-agency \"using the CSA\") or if you're [arranging child maintenance yourself](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself \"arranging child maintenance yourself\").\r\n\r\n##Rates used by the CSA\r\n\r\nThere are 4 rates of child maintenance. They're used with the paying parent's income to work out a weekly amount of child maintenance. \r\n\r\n^The 'paying parent' is the parent the child doesn't live with. The parent or carer they live with is the 'receiving parent'.^\r\n\r\n###Nil rate\r\n\r\nThis means the parent the child doesn't live with doesn't have to pay child maintenance because they:\r\n\r\n- are a student\r\n- are a child aged 16 or under (or 18 or under if they're in full-time education not higher than A-level)\r\n- are a prisoner\r\n- get an allowance for work-based training or Skillseekers training (in Scotland)\r\n- live in a care home or independent hospital and get help with the fees\r\n- are 16 to 17 years old and they or their partner get certain benefits\r\n\r\n###Flat rate\r\n\r\nThis is \u00a35 per week no matter how many children are involved. It's used if the paying parent's weekly income is between \u00a35 and \u00a3100 and they don't qualify for the nil rate. \r\n\r\nIt's also used if they get certain benefits, including (but not limited to):\r\n\r\n- Armed Forces Compensation Scheme payments\r\n- Bereavement Allowance\r\n- Incapacity Benefit\r\n- Income Support\r\n- Employment and Support Allowance\r\n- Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\r\n- Pension Credit\r\n- State Pension\r\n- Training Allowance\r\n- War Disablement Pension\r\n\r\nIf the paying parent lives with a partner, the flat rate will be used if the partner gets:\r\n\r\n- Income Support\r\n- income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\r\n- income-related Employment and Support Allowance\r\n- Pension Credit\r\n\r\n###Reduced rate\r\n\r\nThis is used if the paying parent's net weekly income is more than \u00a3100 but less than \u00a3200. They pay the flat rate of \u00a35 plus a percentage of their net weekly income.\r\n\r\n###Basic rate\r\n\r\nThis is a percentage of the paying parent's net income. It's used if they have a net weekly income of \u00a3200 or more. The percentage depends on:\r\n\r\n- the number of children needing child maintenance\r\n- the number of other children the paying parent or their partner get Child Benefit for\r\n\r\n*[CSA]: Child Support Agency\r\n\r\n","slug":"child-maintenance-rates","title":"Child maintenance rates"}},{"table":{"body":"The Child Support Agency (CSA) looks at several things to work out child maintenance, including:\r\n\r\n- the paying parent's net weekly income\r\n- the number of children needing child maintenance\r\n- how often those children stay overnight with the paying parent\r\n- if the paying parent or their partner gets Child Benefit for any other children\r\n- if the paying parent is paying child maintenance for any other children\r\n\r\n^The 'paying parent' is the parent the child doesn't live with. The parent or carer they live with is the 'receiving parent'.^\r\n\r\n##How the CSA works out net income\r\n\r\nThe paying parent's income is:\r\n\r\n- their earnings\r\n- money from an occupational or personal pension\r\n- certain tax credits\r\n\r\nNet income is what's left after the following are deducted:\r\n\r\n- tax\r\n- National Insurance\r\n- pension contributions\r\n\r\nThe CSA can get information about income from the paying parent's employer or HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).\r\n\r\n##If the paying parent has to pay for other children\r\n\r\nIf the paying parent uses the CSA to pay child maintenance to more than one receiving parent, the CSA will:\r\n\r\n- work out the total amount of child maintenance they have to pay\r\n- divide this between all the receiving parents, according to how many children they care for\r\n\r\nThe CSA has produced a leaflet explaining in more detail how child maintenance is worked out.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n[Download 'How is child maintenance worked out?'
