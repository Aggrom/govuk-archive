<p>UK forces are deployed to Afghanistan in support of the UN-authorised, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (<abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr>) mission and as part of the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom (<abbr title="Operation Enduring Freedom">OEF</abbr>). Since 2003 UK operations in Afghanistan have been conducted under the name Operation HERRICK.</p>

<h2 id="our-strategy">Our strategy</h2>

<p>Britain’s own security is at risk if we again allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists. The aim of the international community is to prevent Afghanistan being a terrorist sanctuary again.</p>

<p>With our international partners the UK intends to achieve this by supporting the development of a stable country able to take its place within the international community.</p>

<p>After the decades of conflict the country has suffered, this is a huge task.</p>

<h3 id="uk-and-international-strategy">UK and international strategy</h3>

<p>Success in the mission requires three parallel strands:</p>

<ol>
<li>Afghan Security Forces capable of keeping the Taliban from regaining control</li>
  <li>Credible governance at national and local level to give the Afghan people confidence in their democratically elected government</li>
  <li>Economic development that gives Afghans a stake in their own future.</li>
</ol>
<p>Troop uplifts announced at the beginning of December 2009 by the US President, UK Prime Minister and over 30 contributing nations providing additional resources sought by General McChrystal in his Strategic Assessment demonstrate the collective international resolve to succeed in this campaign.</p>

<p>There is a clear, realistic, and achievable strategy to bring about success in this mission, and a properly resourced campaign plan to deliver it.</p>

<h3 id="enabling-transition">Enabling transition</h3>

<p>At the heart of the strategy is a process of transition from the international community and <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> to the Government of Afghanistan, with the continuing engagement and support of the international community.</p>

<p>That transition has three phases</p>

<h4 id="gaining-the-initiative">Gaining the initiative</h4>

<p>To capitalise upon <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> troop increases to seize the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum.</p>

<h4 id="consolidation">Consolidation</h4>

<p>Working with the Afghan National Security Forces, to hold the gains won in the near-term, ensuring that the Taliban cannot return.</p>

<h4 id="sustained-security">Sustained security</h4>

<p>In the longer term, to enable the phased handover to the Afghans of security responsibility by supporting the growth and capability of the Afghan National Security Forces through closer integration and partnering; and by facilitating improvements in governance and socio-economic development, in order to provide a sustainable, secure environment.</p>

<p>The pace of the transition will be determined by conditions on the ground.</p>

<p>Central to transition is building and strengthening the Afghan Army, the Afghan Police and the Afghan justice system. <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> is addressing the threat of violent extremism and, increasingly, training and mentoring the Afghan Army and Police so that they can do this themselves.</p>

<p>To enable transition, <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> is working in support of the Afghan Government to implement a counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy which incorporates the lessons of past conflicts. Its key features are:</p>

<ul>
<li>protecting the population</li>
  <li>providing sufficient security for Afghan governance to take hold, particularly in the provinces. That includes arrangements for delivering basic services and administering justice</li>
  <li>building and training indigenous forces</li>
  <li>reintegrating into society insurgents who are prepared to renounce violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these features aim to give the Afghan people confidence that the Taliban will not return to power and that they can plan on a better future.</p>

<p>The role of <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> will change as the transition proceeds; as we move from one phase to another, the balance of activity between <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> and the Afghan security forces will alter:</p>

<p>Afghan forces will take on responsibility for the security of more and more of the country, on a district-by-district basis. They already have the lead for security in Kabul. In Helmand, we hope that the process of handing over security responsibility for the first districts to Afghan forces will begin in 2011</p>

<p><abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> will increasingly operate in support of Afghan forces, with <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> units partnering Afghan ones</p>

<p>As this proceeds, we will see a gradual shift in emphasis within <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> from combat roles to support roles (such as surveillance, logistics) – for the growing and increasingly capable Afghan forces.</p>

<p>The timing and sequence of transition will depend on conditions and progress. This is a process of transition, not a rigid timetable. But it is important to establish momentum and for the Afghans to take the lead for their own security.</p>

<p>It is entirely conceivable that the conditions will be right by the second half of 2011 to allow Afghan forces increasingly to take responsibility for security across Afghanistan and for <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> forces to begin to draw down in some areas. If progress continues at that rate, we would expect Afghan forces to take responsibility for the security of most, if not all, of Afghanistan by around 2014.</p>

<h3 id="a-strategy-for-success">A strategy for success</h3>

<p>We believe that this strategy is achievable for five reasons:</p>

<p>Because the Afghan people do not support the Taliban. All the indications are that Afghans want a normal life. Recent polling shows that 90 per cent of Afghans do not want the repressive Taliban regime back (BBC-ABC-ARD Afghan Opinion Poll 2009, 30 Dec 2008 – 12 Jan 2009)</p>

<p>In Helmand it is estimated that over 40,000 farmers have participated in Governor Mangal’s programme to grow wheat seed instead of opium, school enrolment in the province has risen by 18 per cent since December 2008, and Community Councils are now active in four of Helmand’s districts, providing local elders with a stake in their own governance.</p>

<p>Because we have already made progress in building and strengthening the Afghan Army, Police and justice system:</p>

<ul>
<li>the army is growing steadily towards its target strength of 134,000 by October 2010</li>
  <li>the police is more challenging, but we are making progress, albeit more slowly. The size of the police has increased from around 75,000 in March to 90,000 in December. And, despite well-publicised problems, there are many examples of Afghan Police taking the fight to the Taliban</li>
  <li>access to reliable and efficient justice is a key demand of the Afghan people. In Helmand, with our support, the Provincial Governor is extending the reach of traditional shuras of elders to resolve disputes etc. These are respected and popular.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we are not undertaking this alone – a large international coalition is engaged. The mission is UN mandated. 60 countries actively support it and 43 nations (soon to be 44) are contributing troops to <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Because the Taliban cannot defeat <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> militarily Whenever the Taliban take on our forces head-to-head, they lose. That’s why they have turned increasingly to “asymmetric” tactics like laying IEDs which are killing and maiming not only Afghan civilians and <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> troops, but large numbers of Afghan civilians. </p>

<p>But these tactics are further alienating them from the civilian population. We are increasing our counter-IED capability – and will reduce the effect of this threat over time.</p>

<p>Because where we are implementing our counter-insurgency strategy, Afghan people are embracing the greater security and opportunity it brings. In Helmand, HM Armed Forces and the UK Civil-Military Mission have been executing this Counter-Insurgency strategy. We are very aware of the human price that we – and the Afghan people – have already paid. But we, our international allies and the Afghans are making progress. </p>

<p>In the last 12 months, we have brought two major population centres back under government control and we are steadily re-establishing the security needed for governance to take hold. As security grows, so does confidence – as demonstrated by the increasing volume of economic activity and the re-opening of schools in central Helmand. </p>

<h3 id="resourcing-the-strategy">Resourcing the Strategy</h3>

<p>Our strategy is well resourced. UK Government military spending in Afghanistan is going up every year, from £700m in Financial Year (FY) 06/07 to over £3.7bn in FY09/10 – on top of the defence budget; and an aid programme on Afghanistan and Pakistan worth over £1bn over four years.</p>

<p>We are also spending £15m building up the capability of Pakistan’s security services and £32m for humanitarian assistance in the region.</p>

<p>We do everything we can to support our Armed Forces as they risk their lives for our country. We have increased the number of helicopters and crews so they can fly for longer and the first Merlin helicopters are operational, a month ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>We have spent over £1bn on over 1,000 protected vehicles and the end of the year will see a doubling in the total number of Mastiff mine-protected vehicles since August. Ridgback armoured vehicle numbers will have increased by 75 per cent.</p>

<p>We agreed to increase to our force numbers to a new level of 9,500, subject to the condition that they were fully equipped for the tasks they were being asked to do.</p>

<p>On 30 November 2009, the Chief of the Defence Staff confirmed this condition has been met and the additional troops deployed in December.</p>

<h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h2>

<p>Britain’s own security is at risk if we again allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists. It is therefore vital to the UK that Afghanistan becomes a stable and secure state that is able to suppress violent extremism within its borders.</p>

<p>20 years of war completely destroyed Afghanistan’s infrastructure, economy and institutions.</p>

<p>Supporting Afghanistan’s development therefore requires the establishment of basic infrastructure, strong democratic institutions, a functioning legal system, and a sustainable and legitimate economy capable of providing livelihoods for the local population.</p>

<p>British Military personnel are working in Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan to pave the way for reconstruction of the country and help extend the authority of the Afghan Government.</p>

<h3 id="provincial-reconstruction-teams">Provincial Reconstruction Teams</h3>

<p>Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are at the heart of NATO’s International Security Assistance Force’s (<abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr>) mission. They embody a joint military and civilian approach to stabilising Afghanistan.</p>

<p>A PRT is a combination of international military and civilian personnel based in provincial areas of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Currently, there are 26 PRTs operating throughout Afghanistan.</p>

<p>A lead nation retains responsibility for a PRT but each one may also contain military and civilian personnel from other nations. Their military components come under the <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> command and are coordinated by the relevant Regional Command.</p>

<p>Each PRT has three core tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>to support the extension of the authority of the Afghan central government</li>
  <li>to support reform of the security sector</li>
  <li>to facilitate development and reconstruction</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary role of the military personnel in each PRT is to provide an enabling security environment in which the authority of the Afghan Government can be extended, and development and reconstruction work carried out.</p>

<p>Military personnel do this by undertaking tasks such as patrolling and liaising with the local population. The military components of the PRT are also in charge of directing assistance to the civilian elements, in particular at the levels of transport, medical assistance and engineering.</p>

<p>With a secure environment in place, civilian personnel can then work closely with the Afghan government and with the military to provide a seamless package of assistance, leading on political, economic, humanitarian and social aspects.</p>

<p>Each PRT is tailored to the prevailing security situation, socio-economic conditions, terrain, and reach of the central government.</p>

<p>The PRT model has shown itself to be highly effective. PRTs have brought real benefits to the people in northern and western Afghanistan and in the south they are starting to see tangible results.</p>

<p>Overall, the PRTs in Afghanistan are facilitating various kinds of projects, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>rebuilding schools with the mentoring or assistance of <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> engineers, allowing children to resume their education</li>
  <li>constructing irrigation ditches, pipelines, reservoirs and wells to bring water to the local population and farmers</li>
  <li>repairing infrastructure to facilitate mobility and communication</li>
  <li>providing local people with greater access to medical assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon request, the PRTs also assist the Afghan government and international actors with humanitarian relief. In particular, <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> soldiers have launched several relief missions, distributing medication, food and winter supplies to help villagers cope with severe weather conditions in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>The PRTs are also helping the Afghan Authorities strengthen the institutions required to fully establish good governance and rule of law and to promote human rights.</p>

<p>The PRTs’ principal mission in this respect consists of building capacity, supporting the growth of governance structures and promoting an environment within which governance can improve.</p>

<h3 id="reconstruction-in-helmand-province">Reconstruction in Helmand province</h3>

<p>The UK-led PRT in Helmand, based in Lashkar Gah, despite the challenging security environment, has implemented over 100 Quick Impact Projects aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Afghans. These projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>construction of windmill-powered wells</li>
  <li>construction of schools</li>
  <li>water infrastructure works</li>
  <li>emergency food distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>UK PRT officials are also working with Helmand authorities to strengthen provincial level democracy. They are helping the Afghan Provincial Development Committee prioritise its efforts in line with national plans, enabling Afghan-led reconstruction efforts to get off the ground.</p>

<p>The Helmand PRT has also, along with DFID and USAID, funded Governor Mangal’s first provincial counter-narcotics strategy in which 32,000 farmers received wheat seed, as part of a process of transition to legal livelihoods.</p>

<p>The PRT also helped establish Helmand ‘s first legal aid office in November 2008.</p>

<h3 id="other-uk-aid-and-reconstruction-effort">Other UK aid and reconstruction effort</h3>

<p>The UK has committed £510m for development in Afghanistan over the next four years.</p>

<p>Some of the progress that has been made already includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>child and maternal death rates have fallen, and basic healthcare now covers 82 per cent of the country</li>
  <li>since 2001, infant mortality rates continue to improve from a very low base with immunisation programmes saving 35,000 lives a year</li>
  <li>in 2001 only a million children were in school, all boys and today there are 6.6 million, more than a third girls and the figure is expected to hit eight million by 2012/13</li>
</ul>
<p>In Helmand we have helped set up Justice Committees to provide access to justice, promote peace and strengthen links between communities and the Government. A central theme is to provide counselling for women and children who have suffered most under the old system.</p>

<p>GDP per capita has increased by over 70 per cent since 2002.</p>

<h2 id="training-and-mentoring">Training and mentoring</h2>

<p>It is vital to UK security that Afghanistan becomes a stable and secure state that is able to suppress violent extremism within its borders.</p>

<p>The Afghan Army and Police are not yet ready to confront the insurgency by themselves.</p>

<p>That is why Britain currently has around 9,000 troops in Southern Afghanistan, alongside troops from the US and a number of other countries, taking the fight to the Taliban.</p>

<p>But increasingly British and other <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> troops in Helmand province are also supporting the growth in capacity and capability of the Afghan Security Forces, through training and mentoring, so they can do this job for themselves.</p>

<p>The sooner the Afghans can take responsibility for their own security and carry out security operations without the need for <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> support, ensuring the long-term security and stability of the country, the sooner British forces can come home.</p>

<h3 id="building-afghanistans-national-security-forces">Building Afghanistan’s National Security Forces</h3>

<p>The enabling of the Afghan Security Forces, often referred to as ‘Afghanisation,’ is a key part of NATO’s strategy in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>A NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan (NTM-A) has been launched which is responsible for the Afghan National Security Force’s institutional training, education and professional development activities as set out by the Afghan Ministries of Defence and Interior.</p>

<p>As of late 2009, <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> troops have trained over 90,000 Afghan troops, and 80,000 Afghan police. It is planned that by October 2010 the Afghan Army will be 134,000 strong.</p>

<p>The Afghans are committed to the recruitment of 5,000 soldiers a month from next spring.</p>

<p>Afghan forces are now running security in Kabul. Over time they will take over other districts.</p>

<p>As operations progress, <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> forces, including British troops, will shift the balance of the military effort more and more towards training and mentoring the Afghan Army and Police.</p>

<p>British troops in Afghanistan are supporting the growth of the Afghan Security Forces in a number of ways:</p>

<p>The UK supports Afghan National Army NCO training in Kabul and has trained Afghan cadets at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst</p>

<p>A UK battalion has also been training and mentoring an Afghan National Army Brigade in Helmand Province, undertaking operations alongside their Afghan allies. The ANA troops in Helmand are amongst the most capable in the Afghan Army. Three of the four Infantry Kandaks (Battalions) and the Brigade HQ are capable of conducting operations with minimal <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> support. Recently they have worked alongside <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> troops to deliver the hydro electric turbine to the Kajaki Dam and also in Operation Panther’s Claw. Last year there were 4,200 Afghan soldiers in Helmand, this year there are fifty per cent more</p>

<p>Within the British led Task Force Helmand is an Operational Mentoring and Liason Team (see below) Battle Group working with members of the Afghan National Army</p>

<p>The UK is contributing police officers to the EU Police Mission to Afghanistan and Royal Military Police and Ministry of Defence Police are involved in training and mentoring Afghan National Police</p>

<h3 id="partnering">Partnering</h3>

<p>400 of our armed forces are already dedicated to mentoring the Afghan army.</p>

<p>Over 100 are dedicated to mentoring the Afghan police. They are working together with British and European specialist police trainers.</p>

<p>But all our forces are working increasingly closely with Afghan counterparts as we move towards the approach that we call ‘partnering’.</p>

<p>The strategy of mentoring is what distinguishes a liberating army from an army of occupation: not an army in opposition to local Afghan people, but an army supporting local Afghan people.</p>

<h3 id="operational-mentoring-and-liaison-teams">Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams</h3>

<p>The Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT) programme is an important part of <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr>’s contribution towards the development of the Afghan National Army (ANA).</p>

<p>OMLTs provide training and mentoring to the Afghan National Army. They also serve as a liaison capability between Afghan National Army and <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> forces, co-ordinating the planning of operations and ensuring that the Afghan units receive necessary enabling support (including close air support, casualty evacuation and medical evacuation).</p>

<p>OMLTs are composed of 13-30 personnel (depending on the type and function of the Afghan National Army unit with which it is partnered from one or several countries.</p>

<p>Each OMLT is normally deployed with an Afghan unit for a minimum period of six months.</p>

<p>There are currently 59 OMLTs operating in all five regions of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The NATO-<abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> OMLT programme works complementarily with the US-led Embedded Training Teams (ETT), which perform similar duties.</p>

<p>Under OMLT mentorship, the Afghan National Army’s capabilities are increasing steadily. Today, 28 kandaks (battalions) and 11 HQs (2 x corps and 9 x brigades) have reached the highest standard - Capability Milestone 1 (CM1) - assessed to be fully capable of conducting independent operations at battalion level.</p>

<h2 id="uk-military-equipment">UK military equipment</h2>

<p>In order to support the Afghan government as it builds a peaceful and resilient nation British troops are taking the fight to the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, facing down the insurgency, protecting the Afghan people and laying the conditions that will contribute to stabilisation efforts.</p>

<p>To do this effectively British troops are equipped for the tasks they are required to do. </p>

<p>Operational Commanders have a variety of helicopters, vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and other key equipments at their disposal.</p>

<p>The availability, quantity and type of equipment are key considerations in deciding how specific tasks are to be met on the ground.</p>

<h2 id="british-casualties-in-afghanistan">British casualties in Afghanistan</h2>

<p>All casualties suffered by UK forces are a source of profound regret. UK personnel put their lives on the line to help the people of Afghanistan to build a strong and stable country; we cannot pay high enough tribute to the job that they are doing, or the sacrifice some of them have made.</p>

<p>MOD is committed to publishing casualty statistics, openly and on our website. While we do not publish statistics for all personnel who require minor treatment, we do record details for all personnel who need to be admitted to our field hospitals with more serious injuries and with diseases.</p>

<p>The Defence Medical Services aspire to provide first class treatment for all injured or ill Service personnel, aiming to restore them to full fitness or, where this is not possible, to the best state of health their condition permits. We also work closely with the NHS to ensure a smooth transition into NHS care when responsibility for their healthcare transfers at the point of demobilisation for reservists or discharge for regulars.</p>

<h2 id="casualty-figures">Casualty figures</h2>

<p>For the period 7 October 2001 to 31 December 2005</p>

<p>Centrally available records show that:</p>

<ul>
<li>6 UK Military Personnel were categorised as Very Seriously Injured from all causes excluding disease</li>
  <li>4 UK Military Personnel were categorised as Seriously Injured from all causes excluding disease </li>
</ul>
<p>Work continues to verify and validate data for aeromedical evacuations and field hospital admission in both Iraq and Afghanistan prior to January 2006. Once this data is compiled it will be added to the website.</p>

<p>For the period 1 January 2006 to 31 October 2012</p>

<p>Centrally available records show that:</p>

<ul>
<li>2,055 UK military and civilian personnel were admitted to UK Field Hospitals and categorised as Wounded in Action.</li>
  <li>4,246 UK military and civilian personnel were admitted to UK Field Hospitals for disease or non-battle injuries.</li>
  <li>283 UK personnel were categorised as Very Seriously Injured from all causes excluding disease.</li>
  <li>294 UK personnel were categorised as Seriously Injured from all causes excluding disease.</li>
  <li>6,311 aeromedical evacuations have taken place for UK military and civilian personnel injured or ill in Afghanistan. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medical-facilities-and-classifying-injuries">Medical facilities and classifying injuries</h2>

<h3 id="medical-facilities-for-uk-troops-operating-in-afghanistan">Medical facilities for UK troops operating in Afghanistan</h3>

<p>The UK provides ‘Role 1’ facilities at all UK Main Operating Bases, Forward Operating Bases and Patrol Bases, in Kabul, Kandahar and throughout Helmand Province. Role 1 facilities provide Primary Health Care and Pre-Hospital Emergency Care. The composition and complement of doctors, nurses and medics is dependant on a number of factors; the number of UK personnel being supported, the geographical location, the evacuation time to a surgical facility (Role 2 or Role 3) and the operational situation at the time. The Main Operating Bases at Camp Bastion and Kandahar also have dental, physiotherapy and mental health facilities which are able to provide peripatetic and referral support to all UK personnel.</p>

<p>Those more seriously ill and injured UK personnel are treated at deployed hospital facilities which are either designated as Role 2 or Role 3 dependant on the level of diagnostic and specialist surgical and medical capability they provide. They can provide intensive care and high-dependency facilities, as well as surgical, medical, A+E, physiotherapy, dental, mental health, x-ray, CT and laboratory facilities. UK personnel are primarily supported by the UK led Anglo/American Role 3 hospital at Camp Bastion and the NATO Role 3 facilities at Kabul and Kandahar. However, all Role 2 and Role 3 facilities are available to support <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> and Coalition personnel as determined by the clinical needs of the casualty.</p>

<p>In total the UK deploy over 400 medical staff to support operations in Afghanistan (this includes Medical Group personnel and those integral to the Battle Groups).</p>

<h3 id="noticas-reporting">NOTICAS reporting</h3>

<p>Notification of Casualty (or ‘NOTICAS’) is the name for the formalised system of reporting casualties within the UK Armed Forces. It sets in train the MOD’s next of kin informing procedure. NOTICAS is taken extremely seriously - as the MOD’s Joint Casualty and Compassionate Policy and procedures set out, NOTICAS reports are to be raised for every casualty and the reporting process is undertaken as quickly and sensitively as possible, it takes precedence over all but the most urgent operational and security matters.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-of-seriously-injured-and-very-seriously-injured">Definitions of ‘Seriously Injured’ and ‘Very Seriously Injured’</h3>

<p>The NOTICAS reports raised for casualties contain information on how seriously medical staff in theatre judge their condition to be. This information is used to inform what the next of kin are told. ‘VSI’ and ‘SI’ are the two most serious categories into which personnel can be classified.</p>

<p>‘Very Seriously ill/ Injured/wounded’ or VSI is the definition we use where the illness or injury is of such severity that life or reason is imminently endangered.</p>

<p>‘Seriously ill/Injured/Wounded’ or SI is the definition we use where the patient’s condition is of such severity that there is cause for immediate concern, but there is no imminent danger to life or reason. </p>

<p>The VSI and SI categories are defined by Joint Casualty and Compassionate Policy and Procedures. They are not strictly ‘medical categories’ but are designed to give an indication of the severity of the illness to inform what the individual’s next of kin are told. In the figures for Operation HERRICK (Afghanistan) and Operation TELIC (Iraq) we have excluded those individuals categorised as VSI or SI whose condition was identified to be caused by illness, to produce figures for the number of UK personnel categorised as VSI and SI whatever the cause of the injury, but excluding illnesses.</p>

<h3 id="wounded-in-action">Wounded in Action</h3>

<p>This figure is based on Wounded in Action figures, including those wounded as a result of hostile action and is derived from admission data returns from the UK Role 2 enhanced facility in Camp Bastion, the Canadian Role 3 facility in Kandahar and the French and Greek Role 2 facilities in Kabul.</p>

<p>These figures give the total number of aeromedical evacuations,including any aeromed movements connected to the casualty’s treatmentoutside of Afghanistan.</p>

<h3 id="non-battle-injuries">Non-battle injuries</h3>

<p>Any injury that is not caused by a hostile act - examples could include a sports injury or a road traffic accident.</p>

<h3 id="the-difference-between-killed-in-action-and-died-of-wounds">The difference between Killed in Action and Died of Wounds?</h3>

<p>Killed in Action is the definition used where a battle casualty is killed outright or dies as a result of wounds or other injuries before reaching a medical treatment facility. Died of Wounds is the definition used where a battle casualty dies of wounds or other injuries received in action, after having reached a medical treatment facility.</p>

<h3 id="improvements-in-the-way-casualty-figures-are-collected-and-reported">Improvements in the way casualty figures are collected and reported</h3>

<p>Since 28 October 2006 we have been able to provide data on the personnel admitted to medical facilities as a result of disease, as well as for non-battle injury. This was a challenge because these statistics include data provided by other <abbr title="International Security Assistance Force">ISAF</abbr> nations in Afghanistan, who do not use the same definitions of disease. This additional reporting has been brought about by improvements in tracking of this category of personnel, and brings the reporting of statistics for casualties in Afghanistan into line with reporting for casualties in Iraq.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since 28 October 2006 improvements in the way the data is recorded in theatre, collated, and analysed back in the UK have made it possible for updates to be provided every two weeks, two weeks in arrears, rather than monthly, one month in arrears.</p>

<h2 id="british-fatalities">British fatalities</h2>

<p>It is with very deep regret that the Ministry of Defence has confirmed the following fatalities suffered during operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>As at 11 November 2012, a total of 438 British forces personnel or MOD civilians have died while serving in Afghanistan since the start of operations in October 2001.</p>

<p>Of these, 395 were killed as a result of hostile action.</p>

<p>43 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents, or have not yet officially been assigned a cause of death pending the outcome of an investigation. The balance of these figures may change as inquests are concluded.</p>
