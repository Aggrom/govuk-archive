</article><article id="paying-the-bill"><header><h1>Part 2: Paying the bill</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re 18 or over and own or rent a home, you’ll usually have to pay Council Tax. Spouses and partners who live together are jointly responsible for paying the bill.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure about who’s responsible for paying, <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">contact your local council</a>.</p>

<h2>When payments are due</h2>
<p>Your Council Tax bill tells you:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much you have to pay for the year</li>
  <li>how that amount has been worked out</li>
  <li>the dates you have to pay</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost is usually split into 10 monthly payments. You can ask your council to spread the payments over 12 months if you want.</p>

<p>If the amount of Council Tax you have to pay changes during the year, you’ll get a new bill.</p>

<h2>Ways to pay</h2>
<p>Some councils let you <a href="/pay-council-tax" title="Pay your Council Tax online">pay your Council Tax online</a> or over the phone.</p>

<p>You can usually also pay:</p>

<ul>
<li>by post</li>
  <li>by direct debit</li>
  <li>by standing order</li>
  <li>in person at your council’s offices</li>
  <li>using ‘Paypoint’, ‘Payzone’ or ‘Quickcards’ for cash payments at post offices, banks, newsagents and convenience stores</li>
</ul></article><article id="council-tax-exemptions"><header><h1>Part 3: Council Tax exemptions</h1>
  </header><p>A full Council Tax bill is based on at least 2 adults living in a home. </p>

<p>If you count as an adult for Council Tax and live on your own, you’ll get 25% off your bill.</p>

<p>You’ll also get a discount if you live with people who don’t count as adults for Council Tax.</p>

</div>

<h2>Who doesn’t count?</h2>
<p>These people are <strong>not</strong> counted as adults for Council Tax:</p>

<ul>
<li>children under 18</li>
  <li>people on apprentice schemes</li>
  <li>18 and 19-year-olds in full-time education</li>
  <li><a href="/council-tax/full-time-students" title="Students">full-time college and university students</a></li>
  <li>young people under 25 who get funding from the Skills Funding Agency or Young People’s Learning Agency</li>
  <li>student nurses</li>
  <li>foreign language assistants registered with the British Council</li>
  <li>people with a severe mental <a href="/council-tax/discounts-for-disabled-people" title="disability">disability</a>
</li>
  <li>live-in carers who look after someone who isn’t their partner, spouse or child</li>
  <li>diplomats</li>
</ul>
<p>To work out if you should get a Council Tax discount:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Count the number of adults who live in your home as their main home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discount anyone in the list above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re left with 1 person who counts as an adult, your Council Tax bill will be reduced by 25%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this is your main home and you’re left with no-one who counts as an adult, your bill will be reduced by 50% - <a href="/council-tax/second-homes-and-empty-properties" title="Council Tax (second homes and empty properties)">second homes and empty properties</a> have different rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Your bill doesn’t show a discount</h2>
<p>If there’s no discount listed and you think you should get one, write to <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">your council.</a></p>

<p>The council has 2 months to respond. If you disagree with the council’s decision or don’t hear back within this time, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/A1Form.aspx" title="Appeal to the Valuation Tribunal">appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.</a></p>

<h2>You get a Council Tax discount by mistake</h2>
<p>You must tell your council. If you don’t, you could get a fine.</p>

<p>The council may also ask you to pay back the discount.</p>

</article><article id="full-time-students"><header><h1>Part 4: Full-time students</h1>
  </header><p>Households where everyone’s a full-time student don’t have to pay Council Tax. If you do get a bill, you can <a href="/apply-for-council-tax-discount" title="Apply for a Council Tax exemption">apply for an exemption</a>.</p>

<p>To count as a full-time student, your course must:</p>

<ul>
<li>last at least 1 year</li>
  <li>involve at least 21 hours study per week</li>
</ul>
<p>If you study for a qualification up to A level and you’re under 20, your course must:</p>

<ul>
<li>last at least 3 months</li>
  <li>involve at least 12 hours study per week</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s someone in your household who’s not a full-time student, you will get a Council Tax bill. But your household might still qualify for a <a href="/council-tax/council-tax-exemptions" title="Single person's discount">discount</a>.</p>

</article><article id="discounts-for-disabled-people"><header><h1>Part 5: Discounts for disabled people</h1>
  </header><h2>Disabled band reduction scheme</h2>

<p>This scheme makes sure disabled people don’t pay more Council Tax if they need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a bigger property </li>
  <li>to adapt their home because of their disability</li>
</ul>
<p>The property must be the main home of at least 1 disabled person. They can be an adult or a child and don’t have to be responsible for paying the Council Tax.  </p>

<p>The property must have 1 or more of:</p>

<ul>
<li>an extra bathroom, kitchen or other room for the disabled person</li>
  <li>extra space inside the property for using a wheelchair</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Council Tax reductions</h2>

<p>You can <a href="/apply-for-council-tax-discount" title="Apply for a Council Tax discount">apply for a Council Tax discount</a> from your local council.</p>

</article><article id="second-homes-and-empty-properties"><header><h1>Part 6: Second homes and empty properties</h1>
  </header><h2>Second homes</h2>
<p>You may pay less Council Tax for a property you own or rent that’s not your main home.</p>

<p>Councils can give furnished second homes or holiday homes a discount of between 10% and 50%.</p>

<h2>Empty properties</h2>
<p>There’s no Council Tax to pay on empty and unfurnished homes for up to 6 months. After this, they may qualify for a discount of up to 50%, depending on <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="find your council">your council</a>. It’s up to your council to decide how much discount they give.</p>

<p>If the owner of a house has died, Council Tax isn’t charged for up to 6 months after probate is granted (your legal right to sell the home).</p>

<p>Some homes don’t get a Council Tax bill for as long as they stay empty. They include homes:</p>

<ul>
<li>of someone in prison (except for not paying a fine or Council Tax)</li>
  <li>of someone who’s moved into a care home or hospital</li>
  <li>that have been repossessed</li>
  <li>that cannot be lived in by law</li>
  <li>that are empty because they’ve been compulsory purchased and will be demolished</li>
</ul>
<p>Homes undergoing major repair work or structural changes (like rebuilding walls and floors) don’t get a Council Tax bill for up to 12 months.</p>

<h2>Completion notices</h2>
<p>Local councils usually send completion notices to new homes and properties that have had major home improvements. A completion notice tells you the day the council thinks your property was finished. </p>

<p>You have to start paying Council Tax from this date.</p>


</article><article id="problems-paying-and-financial-help"><header><h1>Part 7: Problems paying and financial help</h1>
  </header><p>Tell <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Contact your local council">your council</a> as soon as you think you’ll have a problem paying your Council Tax bill. </p>

<p>You can choose to spread your payments over 12 months instead of 10 if you’re not already doing so.</p>

<p>If you’re really struggling to pay, your council may be able to give you a one-off discount.</p>

<h2>Council Tax Benefit and Second Adult Rebate</h2>
<p>You may be able to claim <a href="/council-tax-benefit" title="Council Tax Benefit">Council Tax Benefit</a> or Second Adult Rebate if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re on a low income </li>
  <li>you live with another adult (not your partner) who’s on a low income</li>
</ul>
<h2>Missing Council Tax payments</h2>
<p>You Council Tax is split into 10 monthly payments.</p>

<p>If you haven’t spoken to your council about a problem paying your bill, and you miss a payment, your council will ask you for payment:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Your council will send you a <strong>reminder notice</strong> giving you 7 days to pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t pay within 7 days, the council will send you a <strong>final notice</strong>. You’ll also get a final notice if your monthly Council Tax payments are late 3 times in a year. The final notice gives you 7 days to pay the full amount of Council Tax for the whole year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t pay the final notice within 7 days, the council will take <strong>legal action</strong> to get the Council Tax you owe. The court may also make you pay the council’s costs, like hiring a lawyer.</p>
</li>
