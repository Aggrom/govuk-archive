    <section role="main"><header><h1>County court judgments for debt, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If someone takes court action against you, saying you owe them money, and you don’t respond, you could get a county court judgment (CCJ) or High Court judgment.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You have 14 days to <a href="/respond-to-court-claim-for-money/" title="respond to the court claim">respond to the court claim</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you get a judgment, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money.</p>

<p>The judgment will come in the post and will explain:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much you owe</li>
  <li>how you should pay (in full or in instalments)</li>
  <li>the deadline for paying</li>
  <li>details of who you need to pay</li>
</ul>
<p>Records of judgments are kept for 6 years unless you pay the full amount within a month - this can make it hard to get credit.</p>

<p>If you don’t owe the money, you can ask the court to cancel, or ‘set aside’, the judgment.</p>

<p>If you do owe the money, you should arrange to pay what you can afford.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you get a judgment don’t ignore it - you could be taken back to court and forced to pay.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="if-you-dont-owe-the-money"><header><h1>Part 2: If you don't owe the money - cancel the judgment</h1>
  </header><p>If you don’t owe the money, you can ask the court to cancel the county court judgment (<abbr title="county court judgment">CCJ</abbr>) or High Court judgment. This is known as getting the judgment ‘set aside’.</p>

<p>You can do this if you didn’t receive, or didn’t respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money.</p>

<h2>Apply to get the judgment set aside</h2>

<p>To get a judgment set aside, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=484" title="application notice (N244)">application notice (N244),</a> and send it to the court.</p>

<p>You may have to pay an £80 <a href="/court-fees-what-they-are/" title="court fee">court fee</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll have to go to a private hearing at the court, to explain why you don’t owe the money.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you don’t go to the hearing, your application will be rejected and you’ll have to pay the amount in the judgment.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-you-do-owe-the-money-pay-the-judgment"><header><h1>Part 3: If you do owe the money - pay the judgment</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll have to pay the person or business you owe the money to, or their solicitor. The name and address will be on the judgment form. Don’t pay the court.</p>

<p>Make sure you can prove you’ve paid. Send a cheque or postal order by post, or make a bank transfer. Don’t send cash through the post.</p>

<p>Keep a record of your payments and make sure you pay in time.</p>

<h2>Pay in instalments</h2>

<p>If you’re paying in instalments, ask the person or business you owe the money to about the best way to pay. </p>

<p>You may want to set up a standing order to pay the money directly from your bank account.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ask to change the payments</h2>

<p>You can ask to change the amount you pay per week or per month.</p>

<p>To do this, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=486" title="N245 application form">N245 application form.</a></p>

<p>Give details of your income and spending, and say how much you can realistically afford to pay.</p>

<p>You may have to pay a £40 <a href="/court-fees-what-they-are/" title="court fee">court fee</a>.</p>

<p>If your offer is rejected, the court will decide on the amount you have to pay.</p>

<h2>If you’re threatened with bailiffs</h2>

<p>The person or business you owe money to may use bailiffs to collect the money.</p>

<p>They’ll have to apply to the court for a ‘warrant’, which will give the bailiff the right to visit your home or property.</p>

<p>You’ll be given 7 days to pay before they visit.</p>

<p>You may be able to stop the bailiff from visiting, by filling in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=486" title="application to vary an instalment order">N245 application form.</a></p>

<p>Say on the form how you’ll repay the money - eg weekly or monthly payments.</p>

<p>If your offer is accepted, the warrant will be stopped as long as you keep up with the payments.</p>

<h2>If you have other judgments or debts</h2>

<p>If you have another judgment against you, you can arrange to pay all your debts to the court in a single weekly or monthly payment.</p>

<p>This will stop people taking action against you to get their money - eg by sending bailiffs to your home.</p>

<p>You can only do this if your total debts are under £5,000.</p>

<p>You’ll need to fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=651" title="application for an administration order">application for an administration order (N92).</a></p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Contact the court if you can’t keep up with the payments.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="ccjs-and-your-credit-rating"><header><h1>Part 4: CCJs and your credit rating</h1>
  </header><p>If you get a county court judgment (CCJ) or a High Court judgment, it will stay on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines for 6 years. </p>

<p>Banks and loan companies use this information to decide whether to give you credit or loans.</p>

<h2>If you pay within a month</h2>

<p>If you pay the full amount within a month you can get the judgment removed from the register.</p>

<h2>If you pay after a month</h2>

<p>If you pay after a month, you can get the record of the judgment marked as ‘satisfied’ in the register.</p>

<p>It will stay on the register for 6 years but people searching the register will see that you’ve paid.</p>

<p>Contact the court to say you’ve paid - you’ll need to send proof of payment, and pay a £15 court fee.</p>

<h2>Search the register of judgments</h2>

<p>You can search for details of any judgments against you on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.trustonline.org.uk/search-yourself/" title="register of judgments">register of judgments.</a></p>

<p>You’ll have to pay a small fee - a simple search costs £4.</p>

<p>If the information on the register is wrong, contact Trust Online, who will check the details with the court:</p>
