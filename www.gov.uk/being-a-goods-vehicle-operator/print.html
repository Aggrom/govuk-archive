  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If your business uses goods vehicles above a certain weight, you’ll need a goods vehicle operator’s licence.</p>

<p>You need a licence to carry goods in a lorry, van or other vehicle with either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a gross plated weight (the maximum weight that the vehicle can have at any one time) of over 3,500 kilograms </li>
  <li>an <a href="/vehicle-weights-explained" title="unladen weight">unladen weight</a> of more than 1,525 kilograms (where there is no plated weight)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also make sure that any <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/employing-or-using-drivers" title="employing drivers">drivers</a> you use or employ have the correct licence and training. All vehicles that you use should be correctly <a href="/car-tax-disc-vehicle-licence" title="get a tax disc">taxed</a> and kept safe and in good condition at all times.</p>

<h2>Motor vehicles and trailers</h2>

<p>For a motor vehicle and trailer combination, you’ll need a goods vehicle operator’s licence if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the motor vehicle and the trailer(s) are plated and the total of their gross plated weights is more than 3,500 kg</li>
  <li>the total unladen weight of the vehicle and trailer combination is more than 1,525 kg</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need an operator’s licence if your trailer’s unladen weight is less than 1,020 kg and you only carry your own 
goods. </p>

<h2>Carrying goods for hire or reward</h2>

<p>If you’re carrying other people’s goods for hire or reward (eg working as a courier or freight transport business) and the vehicle and trailer combination exceeds the weight limits above for a single vehicle, then you’ll need a <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/types-of-licence" title="types of licence">standard licence</a>.</p>

</article><article id="types-of-licence"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of licence</h1>
  </header><p>There are 3 different types of operator’s licence for goods vehicles. The licence you need depends on where you transport goods to and from, and who you do it for. </p>

<h2>Standard licence (national only)</h2>

<p>This licence means you can carry your own and other people’s goods in Great Britain. You can also take loaded trailers to or from ports within Great Britain as part of an international journey, as long as your vehicles don’t leave the country.</p>

<h2>Standard licence (national and international)</h2>

<p>This licence means you can carry your own goods, and other people’s goods, both in Great Britain and on international journeys. </p>

<p>When you get a standard international licence, you can also request the issue of Community Licences. These allow:</p>

<ul>
<li>trips between all EU member countries</li>
  <li>transit traffic through EU member countries</li>
  <li>
<a href="/cabotage" title="cabotage">cabotage</a> (journeys entirely within another EU member country)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restricted licence</h2>

<p>This licence allows you to carry your own goods, but not other people’s goods.</p>

<p>Your licence will continue to be valid as long as you <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/fees-for-goods-vehicle-licences" title="fees for goods vehicle licences">pay your continuation fee</a> every 5 years and operate within the terms of your licence. You’ll be contacted every 5 years to make sure that your licence shows the correct information.</p>

<h2>Transport outside the EU</h2>

  </header><p>The goods vehicle operator licensing scheme is administered by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) on behalf of the traffic commissioners.</p>

<h2>What the traffic commissioners do</h2>

<p>Great Britain is divided into 8 <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/contactus/vosalocationsandofficesofthetrafficcommissioners/centralisedlicensingunitandofficesofthetrafficcommissioners.htm" title="traffic areas">traffic areas</a> with a traffic commissioner responsible for each area. You’ll need to hold a goods vehicle operator’s licence for each traffic area where you have an operating centre. </p>

<p>Traffic commissioners are responsible in their area for:</p>

<ul>
<li>licensing operators of Heavy Goods Vehicles (<abbr title="Heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>granting vocational licences</li>
  <li>taking action against drivers of <abbr title="Heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> </li>
</ul>
<p>When necessary, they also hold public inquiries to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>the environmental suitability of HGV <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/operating-centres" title="operating centres">operating centres</a>
</li>
  <li>applications for new licences</li>
  <li>disciplinary action against operators who have <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/what-happens-if-you-break-the-terms-of-your-licence" title="what happens if you break the terms of your licence">broken the conditions of their licences</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to apply for a licence</h2>

<p>Apply for your goods vehicle operator’s licence at least 9 weeks before you want to start operating, to allow time for your application to be processed.</p>

<p>You will also need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>advertise your application for a licence</li>
  <li>advertise your proposed <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/operating-centres" title="operating centres">operating centre(s)</a>
</li>
  <li>designate a transport manager if you’re applying for a standard licence</li>
  <li>provide information about your financial situation</li>
  <li>draw up a maintenance contract with a garage or agent to do safety inspections and repair vehicles if you don’t do this yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll have to pay a <a href="/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/fees-for-goods-vehicle-licences" title="fees for goods vehicle licences">fee to apply for a licence.</a></p>

  <li>the environmental impact of the operating centre</li>
