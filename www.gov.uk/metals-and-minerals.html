<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide provides an overview of the metals and minerals sector, the key regulations you will need to comply with as an exporter or importer and selected sources of further help and support.</p>

<p>It also shows you how to research the countries you plan to export to, and how to comply with health and safety, environmental and sector-specific regulations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>See the detailed guide for help with classifying iron and steel.  </p>

<h2 id="export-regulations-in-the-metals-and-minerals-sector">Export regulations in the metals and minerals sector</h2>

<p>Regulations, charges or other restrictions may apply to metals and minerals exports as they leave the UK and when they arrive at their destination country. It is important that you research both sides of the transaction. Mineral oils, for instance, also attract excise duty - see the section on fuel duty.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guides on exporting your goods from the EU to a third country and dispatching your goods within the EU.</p>

<p>First, you need to classify your goods. Use of standardised classification codes makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply. You can use the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom to classify your goods.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a></p>
</div>

<p>For more information on iron and steel, see the guide on classifying iron and steel.</p>

<p>Remember that in general it is much simpler to trade with other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries than with countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> because the goods are in free circulation. The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is a single market and the UK is in a customs union, so you can trade with other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries without restriction (although some local charges and excise duty may still apply).</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> operates the Authorised Economic Operator (<abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr>) scheme. While the scheme is not compulsory, companies that meet the requirements of the scheme will be registered as <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operators">AEOs</abbr> and can take advantage of simplified customs procedures that relate to the security and safety of their goods in transit. Read the guide on Authorised Economic Operators.</p>

<h3 id="export-licensing-and-certification">Export licensing and certification</h3>

<p>An export licence is required in order to export specified goods with military uses, or if you trade in strategically controlled goods between overseas countries. You may require an export licence for goods with a potential military use, such as certain metal fuels and alloys with particular characteristics, such as the ability to withstand very high temperatures. To find out more about strategic export controls, see the section on the Export Control Organisation.</p>

<p>For information on export licences, read the guide on Controlled goods: licences, sanctions and embargoes.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-goods-for-processing">Exporting goods for processing</h3>

<p>You may be able to obtain relief from customs duties when you re-import European Community (EC) goods that have previously been exported from the EC for processing. Outward Processing Relief (<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>) enables you to claim relief from customs duty if you can show that the exported goods were used in - or incorporated into - the products being imported. Before you can claim duty relief under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>, however, you must have the appropriate authorisation. For more information, <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ukInfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000225#P20_925">read notice 235 on <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a> and see the guide on outward processing relief (OPR).</p>

<p>New legislation controls activities of the transport sector concerning transport of military items. See the guides on transport controls and brokering trade of dual-use items.</p>

<h2 id="researching-your-export-destination-for-metals-and-minerals">Researching your export destination for metals and minerals</h2>

<p>You should thoroughly research your export destination country when planning to export.</p>

<p>There are a number of issues that you ought to consider. As a starting point you may wish to seek advice from UK Trade &amp; Investment. <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/unitedkingdom/contactus.html">Find your local international trade team on the UK Trade &amp; Investment website</a>.</p>

<p>There are also various ways that you can research a potential export destination. These include trade associations, which are listed at the end of this guide.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a></p>
</div>

<p>Key things to check include:</p>

<ul>
<li>prohibitions or quotas on your products</li>
  <li>import licensing restrictions</li>
  <li>rates of duty payable when your goods enter your export market</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider product safety and other technical standards in your export market. Your goods may need to be adapted to comply with these. Rules in your export market may be less or more strict than in the UK.</p>

<p>For a general guide to market information on sectors and countries, see the guide on entering overseas markets.</p>

<p>You can ask for information about your export destination country from a range of organisations, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>your local <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment *[AEO]: Authorised Economic Operator">UKTI</abbr> trade team</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment *[AEO]: Authorised Economic Operator">UKTI</abbr> team within the commercial section of the UK embassy in your destination country</li>
  <li>metals and minerals sector trade associations</li>
  <li>the Chambers of Commerce in the UK and in your destination country</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment *[AEO]: Authorised Economic Operator">UKTI</abbr> is a government organisation that supports UK businesses trading internationally and overseas enterprises seeking to set up or expand in the UK. <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment *[AEO]: Authorised Economic Operator">UKTI</abbr> has an impartial global presence in countries throughout the world and helps businesses realise their international potential through knowledge transfer and ongoing partnership support.</p>

<h2 id="tariffs-and-duties-for-metal-and-mineral-imports">Tariffs and duties for metal and mineral imports</h2>

<p>There is a range of import-specific regulations to be complied with by all businesses in this sector. The key issues relate to the Tariff, preferential rates of duty, levies charged on aggregates and mining and the Climate Change levy. </p>

<h3 id="using-the-integrated-tariff">Using the Integrated Tariff</h3>

<p>A common customs tariff is applied across all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on goods imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Details of specific tariff duties and measures are contained in the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a></p>
</div>

<p>Find out how to classify your goods by reading the guide on classifying iron and steel.</p>

<p>The Tariff is used to determine the specific commodity code of your goods and to discover:</p>

<ul>
<li>any licensing requirements that apply</li>
  <li>the rates of duty and import VAT that apply</li>
  <li>any additional charges, such as anti-dumping duties</li>
  <li>any available preferential duty rates</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preferential-rates-of-duty">Preferential rates of duty</h3>

<p>The Generalised System of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>) allows products from a wide range of countries to be imported in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> at a reduced or zero rate of duty.</p>

<p>The European Community has a number of other preferential trade agreements with third countries, as a result of which goods may attract preferential rates of duty.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000193">Find out if your goods qualify for a preferential rate of duty and meet the appropriate rules of origin on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="intrastat">Intrastat</h3>

<p>Intrastat is the method of collecting information and producing statistics on goods traded between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states. Intrastat is only applicable to VAT-registered traders.</p>

<p>If you are VAT registered and the goods you acquire from or supply to VAT-registered businesses in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries reach the Intrastat exemption threshold for the year, you must submit monthly supplementary declarations to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Intrastat thresholds are reviewed annually. The 2011 thresholds are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>See the guide on Intrastat - reporting the value and volume of intra-EU trade .</p>

<h2 id="aggregates-levy-and-climate-change-levy">Aggregates levy and climate change levy</h2>

<p>If you extract aggregates or your business is energy-intensive, you need to be aware of how the aggregates levy and climate change levy may affect your business.</p>

<h3 id="aggregates-and-mining">Aggregates and mining</h3>

<p>If you extract aggregates, you must register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and pay a levy, currently set at £2.00 per tonne. The aggregates levy is designed to minimise demand for primary aggregates and promote environmentally-friendly extraction techniques. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_PublicNoticesAndInfoSheets&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000506&amp;propertyType=document#P375_45452">find out how to register and pay the levy on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>. This also contains details about relief from the levy for aggregates not used for construction - known as industrial and agricultural processes relief. </p>

<p>Tax relief is available for qualifying capital expenditure on mineral acquisition, access and exploration. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/camanual/CA50200.htm">Read about Mineral Extraction Allowance on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Relief is also available for aggregates exported outside the UK. Levy on imported aggregates is due not when it arrives in the UK but only when it is commercially exploited. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000506#P326_40877">Read about the relief for exported aggregates and about the levy on imported aggregates on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="climate-change">Climate change</h3>

<p>The climate change levy is a tax added to most energy costs used in industry. It applies to gas, electricity, coal and liquefied petroleum gas.</p>

<p>Energy-intensive businesses may benefit from a reduction in the climate change levy negotiated by their trade association. If you belong to one of these climate change agreements (<abbr title="climate change agreements">CCA</abbr>) you can get an 80 per cent discount on the tax, but you and your fellow members will have to reach set targets.

<h2 id="import-regulations-in-the-metals-and-minerals-sector">Import regulations in the metals and minerals sector</h2>

<p>As the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is a customs union, you can buy most goods from other member countries without restrictions - although VAT and excise duty can still apply. For more information, see the guide on trading in the European Union. </p>

<p>For information on paying VAT and VAT relief, see the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/imports/importing.htm">imports and purchases from abroad: paying and reclaiming VAT.</a></p>

<p>If you import from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you may have to comply with import licensing requirements and with common customs tariffs that apply across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For more information, see the guide on importing your goods from outside the EU.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> runs the Authorised Economic Operator (<abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr>) scheme. While the scheme is not compulsory, companies that meet the requirements of the scheme will be registered as <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operators">AEOs</abbr> and can take advantage of simplified customs procedures that relate to the security and safety of their goods in transit. Read the guide on Authorised Economic Operators.</p>

<h3 id="import-licences">Import licences</h3>

<p>Under Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>) legislation, importers or manufacturers of more than one tonne of chemicals a year must register and work with the European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>). <a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/reach_en.asp">Read about <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> legislation on the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Import restrictions can be product-specific or trade-specific. Many products are subject to product-specific standards and need to be supported by applicable certificates, product-specific licences and documentation.</p>

<p>Quite separately, quantitative restrictions or limitations and anti-dumping duties may apply to certain imported commodities. For more information, see the guide on anti-dumping and countervailing duties.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a></p>
</div>

<p>You need a licence to import most iron and steel products. There are also a small number of quantitative quotas against a few exporting countries, for which you will need to apply for an import licence.</p>

<p>For help identifying whether you require an import licence see the guide: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/export-and-import-licences-for-controlled-goods-and-trading-with-certain-countries">Controlled goods: licences, sanctions and embargoes</a>.</p>

<p>Certain raw materials can be imported duty-free if adequate supplies can’t be sourced from within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Under a temporary duty suspension, unlimited quantities can be imported. Under a tariff quota, duty-free imports are limited - once the quota is used up, payment of duty resumes.</p>

<p>Goods imported to the UK must comply with domestic business standards, including those relating to health and safety, standards compliance, environmental protection, planning permission and tax. </p>

<h2 id="health-and-safety-environmental-and-sector-regulations-for-metals-and-minerals-businesses">Health and safety, environmental and sector regulations for metals and minerals businesses</h2>

<p>To safeguard against risks specific to businesses in the metals and minerals sector, you need to comply with UK health and safety and environmental rules and procedures.</p>

<p>If you are extracting, manufacturing or building abroad, you may have local regulations to comply with. Contact the UK embassy of your destination country for advice. <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/foreign-embassies-in-uk/">Find a list of foreign embassies in the UK on the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="health-and-safety">Health and safety</h3>

<p>Sector-specific risks include exposure to chemicals, noise and dust, operation of dangerous machinery and accidents, such as falling.</p>

<p>The Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) publishes health and safety information for businesses in the sector:</p>

<h3 id="environmental-protection">Environmental protection</h3>

<p>A range of environmental regulations can affect businesses in this sector:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations can apply if production volume rises above a prescribed limit, or if certain substances are used. Your business may need an environmental permit or a pollution prevention and control permit. See the guide on environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production.</li>
  <li>You must treat all waste before you send it to landfill. Liquid waste is banned. See the guide on how to manage your waste](https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview).</li>
  <li>Businesses handling metal waste or hazardous waste must hold a waste-management licence.</li>
  <li>Some metal production activities are covered by emissions trading rules and require a permit from the environment regulator. In England and Wales, this is the Environment Agency, in Scotland it is the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and in Northern Ireland it is the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.</li>
  <li>Businesses handling or storing oil must comply with oil storage regulations. Read <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/oil/default.aspx">guidance about containers, secondary containment, pipework and pumps on the Environment Agency website</a>.</li>
  <li>The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations, which mean businesses are responsible for collecting and recycling end-of-life products, may affect your business. See the guide on waste management of electrical and electronic equipment.</li>
  <li>The Carbon Reduction Commitment (<abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr>) initiative requires companies consuming over 6,000 megawatt hours of energy a year to register with the Environment Agency. The <abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> charges companies for every ton of greenhouse gas they produce. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/127351.aspx#1">Read <abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment">CRC</abbr> qualification and registration guidance on the Environment Agency website</a>.</li>

<h3 id="specific-regulations">Specific regulations</h3>

<p>Additional regulations may apply to your business, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>mining operations require planning permission and possibly also an environmental assessment <a rel="external" href="http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/planning/legislation/home.html">(see minerals planning process on the Minerals UK website)</a>
</li>
  <li>articles made of precious metals (gold, platinum and silver) must be hallmarked - your trade association may be able to advise you <a rel="external" href="http://www.taforum.org/Members">(find a trade association on the Trade Association Forum website)</a>
</li>
  <li>flammables (such as oil and gas) or explosives (anything dusty) are covered by rules governing dangerous goods (see information about dangerous goods and regulations relating to them)</li>
