<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a manufacturer of toys intended for children, you must comply with the essential requirements of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995. These bring the European Toy Safety Directive 88/378 into UK law.</p>

<p>The main requirements are that toys must:</p>

<ul>
<li>satisfy safety requirements (termed the ‘essential safety requirements’)</li>
  <li>bear the <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking</li>
  <li>bear the required name and address details</li>
  <li>be accompanied by warnings where necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, information must be maintained for inspection by enforcement authorities.</p>

<p>This guide outlines your legal responsibilities as a manufacturer.</p>

<p>On 19 August 2011, regulations are changing in this area. For more information, <a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/ruDetail?itemId=1096781622&amp;r.l1=1081597476&amp;r.l2=1084663915&amp;r.l3=1084755726&amp;r.l4=1084731529&amp;type=REGUPDATE">see the regulation update on Additional European Union safety requirements for new toys (UK).</a></p>

<h2 id="toy-manufacture-regulations">Toy manufacture regulations</h2>

<p>The Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 define a toy as “any product or material designed or clearly intended for use in play by children of less than 14 years of age, but excluding those products specified in Schedule 3 [of the regulations]”.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file11286.pdf">find a list of products not regarded as toys under the regulations in Annex B of the toy safety guidelines on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) website (PDF, 100KB)</a>.</p>

<p>The regulations apply to anyone supplying toys in the course of any business, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>manufacturers</li>
  <li>importers</li>
  <li>retailers</li>
  <li>hirers and other suppliers of new and second-hand toys</li>
</ul>
<p>Toys distributed free of charge in the course of business are also covered. In terms of regulation enforcement, there is no difference between a manufacturer and a supplier.</p>

<p>A revised European directive will come into force on 20 July 2011. The directive substantially amends the existing regulations across virtually all safety aspects and extends the definition to cover more products.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:170:0001:0037:EN:PDF">download the text of the new Directive 2009/48/<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> from the EUR-Lex website (PDF, 995KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="charities-and-toy-sales">Charities and toy sales</h3>

<p>Many charities are subject to the regulations because they have characteristics similar to those of businesses, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>money generating</li>
  <li>a degree of continuity</li>
  <li>regular business hours</li>
</ul>
<p>People organising events such as jumble sales and car boot sales - which are held at infrequent and irregular intervals - are unlikely to be considered as acting in the course of business - but traders invited to sell toys there would not be exempt.</p>

<p>Individuals producing toys on an occasional basis to give to charities to sell are also exempt.</p>

<h3 id="the-person-who-first-places-the-toy-on-the-market">The person who first places the toy on the market</h3>

<p>As a manufacturer, you, or your authorised representative supplying in the UK, must ensure that toys satisfy safety requirements and must take responsibility for the declaration the <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking represents.</p>

<h3 id="other-suppliers">Other suppliers</h3>

<p>Other persons in the supply chain - eg importers who import toys from another member state, wholesalers, retailers - must supply only safe toys that bear the <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking and other specified details.</p>

<h2 id="safety-standards-under-the-toys-safety-regulations">Safety standards under the Toys (Safety) Regulations</h2>

<p>The essential safety requirements of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 state that the toy user, and anyone else, must be protected against risks of injury to health when toys are used reasonably, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children.</p>

<p>There are two methods by which you or your authorised representative can ensure that toys satisfy the essential safety requirements applicable to them:</p>

<ul>
<li>issuing a Declaration of Conformity</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> type-examination</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="declaration-of-conformity">Declaration of Conformity</h3>

<p>You certify you have manufactured in conformity with the relevant national standards - British Standard BS EN 71. A toy manufactured in accordance with BS EN 71 shall be deemed to meet the essential safety requirements if the standards cover all the elements of the essential safety requirements applicable to that particular toy.</p>

<p>Where this method is used, <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking is affixed as a declaration by you that - amongst other things - the toy bearing it satisfies the essential safety requirements and has been manufactured in accordance with the relevant national standards. For more information, see the section in this guide on <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking under the Toys (Safety) Regulations.</p>

<p>Although the regulations do not specify that you must carry out tests to support self certification, information supporting a <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking declaration must be maintained, and the conformity assessment part of the required information will - in many cases - mean using the services of an independent test laboratory.</p>

<h3 id="european-community-type-examination-certificate">European Community type-examination certificate</h3>

<p>You manufacture in accordance with a model that has been European Community (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) type examined. In this case, you must submit a sample of the toy to a Notified Body for <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> type examination. This can be a Notified Body in any member state. The Notified Body will perform the tests and examinations necessary to decide whether or not the toy satisfies the essential safety requirements and - if it does - the body will issue an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> type-examination certificate.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file48852.pdf">download a list of UK Notified Bodies from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (PDF, 40KB)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando/">search for EU notified bodies on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>Once an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> type-examination certificate has been issued, you must ensure that your production toys comply with the sample. You can <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> mark each toy with a self declaration that it has been manufactured in accordance with a specimen that is the subject of an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> type-examination certificate.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that manufacturers and importers undertake a hazard assessment on toys at the prototype stage to decide whether there are any aspects of safety that are outside the scope of the standards.</p>

<h2 id="ce-marking-under-the-toys-safety-regulations">
<abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking under the Toys (Safety) Regulations</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking is a visible declaration by you or your authorised representative that the toy satisfies all the provisions of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995. Toys bearing the mark will be understood to meet the requirements and therefore entitled to free circulation throughout the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that they do in fact satisfy those requirements.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking should be affixed to the toy or - where not possible - to the:</p>

<ul>
<li>packaging</li>
  <li>instruction sheet</li>
  <li>guarantee certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>You may decide for practical reasons to affix it to both the product and its packaging. The mark must be visible, easily legible and in an indelible form.</p>

<p>By affixing <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking to your product, you are making a statement that in your view the toy meets the requirements of all relevant directives. It does not mean that the toy cannot be challenged by an enforcement authority if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting an infringement of the Regulations.</p>

<p>You should also note that <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking is not a European safety mark or quality symbol intended for consumers. Its purpose is to indicate to enforcement authorities that the toy is intended for sale in the EEA.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking also confirms that your product conforms to other directives where they apply.</p>

<p>For more information see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1081597476&amp;r.l2=1084663915&amp;r.l3=1084755726&amp;r.l4=1084731529&amp;topicId=1085531921"><abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking.</a></p>

<h2 id="essential-information-which-should-accompany-toys">Essential information which should accompany toys</h2>

<p>As a manufacturer, it is your responsibility to ensure that all toys have warnings and information about any precautions that must be taken during their use. There are specific requirements for certain types of toys.</p>

<p>Other relevant markings for toys and their packaging should also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>trade marking</li>
  <li>name and address details</li>
  <li>abbreviation of details</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toys-not-intended-for-children-under-36-months">Toys not intended for children under 36 months</h3>

<p>Toys that might be dangerous for children under 36 months of age must have a warning, together with a brief indication of the specific risks. This provision does not apply to toys that are manifestly unsuitable for children under 36 months.</p>

<h3 id="slides-suspended-swings-and-rings-trapezes-ropes-and-similar-toys-attached-to-a-crossbeam">Slides, suspended swings and rings, trapezes, ropes and similar toys attached to a crossbeam</h3>

<p>These toys must be accompanied by instructions drawing attention to the need to carry out the checks and maintenance, and the consequences if they are not carried out. Instructions must also be given about the correct assembly of the toy.</p>

<h3 id="functional-toys">Functional toys</h3>

<p>A functional toy is one that is used in the same way as - and is often a scale model of - an appliance or installation intended for adults.</p>

<p>Functional toys or their packaging must have the marking - “Warning: to be used under the direct supervision of an adult”. They should also have instructions, precautions and warnings about the hazards the toy could expose a child to. The hazards must be specified.</p>

<h3 id="chemical-toys">Chemical toys</h3>

<p>The following are regarded as chemical toys:</p>

<ul>
<li>chemistry sets</li>
  <li>plastic embedding sets</li>
  <li>miniature workshops for ceramics enamelling</li>
  <li>photography and similar toys</li>
</ul>
<p>These toys should include warnings about the dangerous nature of these substances or preparations and give details of specific precautions to be taken. The type of first aid to be given in the event of serious accidents should be mentioned. It should also be stated that the toys must be kept out of reach of very young children.</p>

<h3 id="skates-and-skateboards-for-children">Skates and skateboards for children</h3>

<p>These toys must bear the marking - “Warning: protective equipment should be worn”. Instructions must have a reminder that the toy must be used with caution and some indication should be given as to recommended protective equipment.</p>

<h3 id="toys-intended-for-use-in-water">Toys intended for use in water</h3>

<p>Toys intended for use in water must have the following warning - “Warning! Only to be used in water in which the child is within its depth and under supervision”.</p>

<h2 id="enforcement-of-the-toys-safety-regulations">Enforcement of the Toys (Safety) Regulations</h2>

<p>Trading standards departments of local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales, and environmental health departments of district councils in Northern Ireland, are responsible for day-to-day enforcement of the Toys (Safety) Regulations.</p>

<p>Where the required information cannot be produced, enforcement authorities have the power to require toys to be tested at the supplier’s own expense.</p>

<p>It is an offence for a manufacturer, authorised representative or importer to supply toys:</p>

<ul>
<li>which do not satisfy the essential safety requirements - this includes not jeopardising the safety or health of users or third parties when used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children</li>
  <li>which do not carry the <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking</li>
  <li>for which the relevant information does not exist within the UK or elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an offence for a supplier other than those referred to above to supply toys which:</p>

<ul>
<li>would put at risk the safety or health of users or third parties when used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children</li>

<h3 id="penalties">Penalties</h3>

<p>Offences may result in fines of up to £5,000, or a maximum prison term of six months, or both. Where a supplier does not comply with a request to have toys tested within a reasonable time the penalties are a term of imprisonment up to three months or a fine of up to £5,000.</p>

<h3 id="safeguard-procedure">Safeguard procedure</h3>

<p>If your product fails to meet safety requirements, it will either be removed from the market or prevented from being sold in the first place.</p>

<p>If this happens to your product within the UK, the European Commission will be notified of any action taken against your product when the non-compliance relates to safety and the toy carries the <abbr title="European Conformity">CE</abbr> marking. If the Commission is satisfied that the action is justified, it will send details of the case to other member states so that they can consider taking similar action.</p>
