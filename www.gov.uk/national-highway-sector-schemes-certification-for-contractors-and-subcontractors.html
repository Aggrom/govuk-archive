<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>National Highways Sector Schemes (<abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr>) are bespoke quality management systems for organisations working on the UK road network. They are based on the ISO9001:2008 standards, but do not duplicate them.</p>

<p>There are currently more than 20 individual schemes. They cover activities ranging from fencing, landscaping and vehicle safety restraints to road surfacing and marking, and traffic management.</p>

<p>If your company supplies services to the Highways Agency under the Specification for Highways Works (<abbr title="Specification for Highways Works">SHW</abbr>), you must be certified under all the relevant schemes for the work you are carrying out.</p>

<p>The schemes aim to make sure that work is carried out to the highest standards of professionalism, using properly trained staff. They also place a strong emphasis on health and safety.</p>

<p>This guide explains the benefits of certification, and the steps involved in achieving it. It also describes the range of schemes available, who they apply to, and how to access the scheme documents.</p>

<h2 id="national-highways-sector-schemes-and-who-needs-to-be-certified">National Highways Sector Schemes and who needs to be certified</h2>

<p><abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> are quality management schemes for organisations working on the UK’s road network. They are based on the ISO9001:2008 framework, but interpret it specifically to highways maintenance activities.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> includes more than 20 individual schemes. Each scheme is developed and managed by technical advisory committees. The membership of each committee is made up of industry representatives and other interested parties, such as local authorities, trade associations and certification bodies.</p>

<p>Individual <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> schemes come under four main categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>road surfacing and marking</li>
  <li>fencing, landscaping and vehicle safety restraints</li>
  <li>traffic management</li>
  <li>lighting, electronics and corrosion protection</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of current schemes can be found on the UK Accreditation Service (<abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) website. This is updated when new schemes are added or scheme titles changed. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/Technical-Information/Publications-and-Tech-Articles/Publications/PubsForCBAccred.asp">view a list <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> documents on <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr></a> - see ‘Sector schemes for quality management in highways works’.</p>

<p>Each scheme has a set of Sector Scheme Documents (<abbr title="Sector Scheme Documents">SSDs</abbr>). These describe the minimum standards you will need to meet before you can be certified under that scheme, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>detailed training and competency requirements</li>
  <li>quality plan requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Certification of suppliers is carried out by certification bodies, which in turn are accredited by the <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>. Each body carries out certification activities for at least one individual <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> scheme.</p>

<h3 id="who-needs-to-be-certified">Who needs to be certified</h3>

<p>If your business supplies services covered by <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> to the Highways Agency, you must be registered under all the relevant schemes for that work.</p>

<p>This is a mandatory requirement under the <abbr title="Specification for Highways Works">SHW</abbr>, unless the contract documents state otherwise.</p>

<p>If your business subcontracts the work, you do not have to be registered but any subcontractors you use must be. The <abbr title="Specification for Highways Works">SHW</abbr> does not allow subcontractors to provide services under the umbrella of another registered supplier.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> will be relevant to your business if it includes any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>main contractors and subcontractors who work on the motorway or trunk road network</li>
  <li>contractors or subcontractors that work on or beside roads, including those involved in landscaping work</li>
  <li>manufacturers, installers and repairers of products covered by a scheme</li>
  <li>highway designers and consultants</li>
</ul>
<p>The schemes may also be relevant if your business is involved in the development of industrial, commercial, or private land or property, or carries out work on railways or inland waterways - especially if this is near a road, or adjacent to one.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-national-highways-sector-schemes-certification">Benefits of National Highways Sector Schemes certification</h2>

<p><abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> registration is mandatory for all Highways Agency contract work specified in accordance with the <abbr title="Specification for Highways Works">SHW</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are several advantages to getting registered under <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> if your business has previously worked with the Highways Agency, or you plan to tender for future work:</p>

<ul>
<li>a competitive edge - if you are already <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> registered when tendering for work, you may have an advantage over competitors who are not</li>
  <li>enhanced business credentials - through independent verification of your processes against recognised quality standards</li>
  <li>a better understanding of risk, and how to manage it - the <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> assessment process can help you pinpoint areas of risk in your operations</li>
  <li>new opportunities - if you currently work only on non-national road networks, <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> registration clears the way toward you taking on contracts for the national road network</li>
  <li>greater visibility to contracting bodies - you can join the online Schedule of Suppliers, the only comprehensive national register of independently approved contractors and subcontractors</li>
  <li>access to expertise and support - some trade associations will only accept new members who are <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> registered</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steps-involved-in-getting-certified-under-one-or-more-national-highways-sector-schemes">Steps involved in getting certified under one or more National Highways Sector Schemes</h2>

<p>Before you can be certified and registered under the <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr>, you must pass an assessment carried out by a certification body. These bodies are accredited by <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you do not already have ISO9001:2008 certification, it is possible to include <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> certification as an extension to this. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm">quality management standards</a>.</p>

<h3 id="steps-to-certification">Steps to certification</h3>

<p>Your first step should be to download the <abbr title="Sector Scheme Documents">SSDs</abbr> for each scheme you wish to be registered for. These are available from the <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website.</p>

<p>Next, contact the approved certification body to arrange an audit, followed by an assessment visit. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.scheduleofsuppliers.com/bodies.aspx">view a list of certifying bodies on the <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>The auditors used by certifying bodies have technical knowledge and experience of working in the sector.</p>

<p>The audit will typically consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li>making sure that your quality manual conforms to ISO9001:2008 and the relevant sector scheme</li>
  <li>confirming the scope of certification, ie checking that you are seeking registration for the sector schemes that are relevant to the work you plan to do</li>
  <li>identifying any actual or potential areas of non-compliance, and developing an action plan to remedy these</li>
</ul>
<p>What is covered in the assessment can vary depending on the scheme you are seeking certification for, and the certifying body, but normally involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>carrying out sample audits of your processes and activities</li>
  <li>documenting how your systems for quality management comply with the requirements set out in the <abbr title="Sector Scheme Documents">SSDs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>reporting on any areas of non-compliance, or where there is the potential for non-compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>Audits are not limited to assessing your processes. There is also a strong emphasis on the competency of your personnel, and your organisation’s ability to deliver positive outcomes.</p>

<p>If the assessment reveals any major areas of non-compliance, you will need to take action to correct this. The certifying body will need to verify the action you have taken before it will certify you.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-after-national-highways-sector-schemes-certification-is-achieved">What happens after National Highways Sector Schemes certification is achieved</h2>

<p>If you pass the assessment, you will be formally notified by the certifying body. You may also get a certificate, although this varies from body to body. Some bodies will give you individual certificates for each sector scheme. Others may issue certificates that include details of <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> assessments among other capabilities you may have been assessed on.</p>

<p>You must add your company’s details to the online Schedule of Suppliers. This is the national database of approved contractors for the highways industry. The Schedule is used by highway authorities to check that a company is certified. Many contracting organisations use it to find potential suppliers to invite to tender for projects.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.scheduleofsuppliers.com">View a list of registered suppliers on the <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>To add your company to the schedule, you’ll need an application form available from Lantra Awards at <a href="mailto:NHSSscheduleofsuppliers@lantra-awards.co.uk">NHSSscheduleofsuppliers@lantra-awards.co.uk</a>. </p>

<p>Send the completed form, along with a copy of your approval certificate and the registration fee to:</p>

Lantra House
Stoneleigh Park

CV8 2LG</p>

<h3 id="follow-up-audits">Follow-up audits</h3>

<p>The certifying body will visit you at regular periods - usually once every 12 months - to make sure that your systems continue to meet the standards needed for certification. You will also need to pass a re-certification audit every 3 years.</p>

<h3 id="skills-cards">Skills cards</h3>

<p>You must ensure that each of your employees working on projects covered by an <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> has an appropriately detailed skills card. This provides evidence that the person has all the required skills and training they need for the type or types of work they carry out. </p>

<p>See the relevant Sector Scheme Documents and the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/the-highways-agency-skills-card-and-registration-requirements-for-suppliers">skills card and registration requirements for suppliers of the Highways Agency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-access-national-highways-sector-schemes-documents">How to access National Highways Sector Schemes documents</h2>

<p><abbr title="Sector Scheme Documents">SSDs</abbr> are published for each scheme within the <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>They are developed and maintained by the technical advisory committee for each scheme. Committees are made up of representatives from across the sector, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>contractors</li>
  <li>suppliers</li>
  <li>client bodies</li>
  <li>trade associations</li>
  <li>training organisations</li>
  <li>certification bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>The documents describe how the committee has interpreted the ISO9001:2008 framework as it applies to that particular sector. They define minimum standards and requirements for:</p>

<ul>
<li>workmanship, services, products and testing</li>
  <li>training and competency requirements for operatives and supervisors</li>
  <li>qualifications for auditors used by certification bodies</li>
  <li>specific elements of environmental and other management systems</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Sector Scheme Documents">SSDs</abbr> are ‘living documents’ that the technical advisory committees regularly review and update when necessary. You should make sure that you have access to the current versions before starting the certification process.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> publishes the current documents for each scheme on its website. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/Technical-Information/Publications-and-Tech-Articles/Publications/PubsForCBAccred.asp">download <abbr title="National Highways Sector Schemes">NHSS</abbr> documents on the <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website</a> under ‘Sector schemes for quality management in highways works’.</p>
