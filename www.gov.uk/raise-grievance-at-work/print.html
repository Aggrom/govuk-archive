  </header><p>If you’re a worker and you’ve tried solving a problem or concern informally by talking to your manager but you’re not satisfied, you can make a formal grievance complaint in writing. </p>

<p>Your employer should have a written <a href="/raise-grievance-at-work/grievance-procedure" title="grievance procedure">grievance procedure</a> that tells you what to do and what happens at each stage of the process. After raising the grievance you’ll have a <a href="/raise-grievance-at-work/grievance-meetings" title="grievance meeting">meeting</a> to discuss the issue. </p>

<p>You can <a href="/raise-grievance-at-work/appealing-a-grievance-decision" title="appeal a grievance decision">appeal</a> if you don’t agree with your employer’s decision. </p>

</div>

<p><a href="/raise-grievance-at-work/mediation" title="mediation">Mediation</a> can also help resolve a problem - this can take place at any time during the dispute.</p>

<h2>Following the Acas code of practice</h2>

<p>You and your employer should follow the <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=1041" title="Acas code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures">Acas code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures.</a> </p>

<p>Otherwise, if you take your claim to an <a href="/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal" title="employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a>, any compensation you might get could be adjusted by up to 25%.</p>

</article><article id="grievance-procedure"><header><h1>Part 2: Grievance procedure</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer should put their grievance procedure in writing and share it with all staff, eg on the company intranet or in the HR manual.</p>

<p>It should include information about:</p>

<ul>
<li>how to set out the details of your grievance in writing </li>
  <li>who to send your letter to</li>
  <li>who to write to if the normal contact person is involved in the grievance</li>
  <li>a meeting with your employer to discuss the issue </li>
  <li>how to appeal your employer’s decision</li>
  <li>how long each stage should take </li>
</ul></article><article id="mediation"><header><h1>Part 3: Mediation</h1>
  </header><p>Mediation is when an independent, impartial third party discusses a problem with you and your employer (or between you and another employee) to try and find a solution. It’s often used after informal discussions haven’t solved the issue.</p>

<p>Mediation is voluntary and confidential. The mediator can’t force you or your employer to accept a solution - both parties must agree on the way to solve the dispute.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be used for problems that have to be formally investigated (eg harassment or <a href="/discrimination-your-rights/discrimination-at-work" title="discrimination at work">discrimination</a>).</p>

<p>Read the <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1680%20%E2%80%9CAcas%20guide%20on%20mediation%E2%80%9D" rel="external">Acas guide on mediation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.cmcregistered.org/search/rand?rerand=true%20%E2%80%9Cfind%20a%20mediation%20service%E2%80%9D" rel="external">find a mediation service</a> on the Civil Mediation Council website.</p>

</article><article id="grievance-meetings"><header><h1>Part 4: Grievance meetings</h1>
  </header><h2>What happens at the meeting</h2>

<p>The aim of the meeting is to establish the facts and find a way to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>Your employer will run the meeting. They’ll normally go through the grievance and give the worker the chance to comment. You can bring supporting documents if you want. </p>

<h2>Who can attend meetings with you</h2>

<p>You can be accompanied to grievance meetings (and any appeal meetings) by a: </p>

<ul>
<li>colleague </li>
  <li>trade union representative</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to bring a family member or Citizens Advice Bureau worker, depending on the HR procedure where you work. </p>

<h2>After the meeting</h2>

<p>Afterwards the employer will write to you setting out their decision along with:</p>

<ul>
<li>details of any action they intend to take  </li>
  <li>information about how to appeal</li>
</ul></article><article id="appealing-a-grievance-decision"><header><h1>Part 5: Appealing a grievance decision</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer’s <a href="/raise-grievance-at-work/grievance-procedure" title="grievance procedure">grievance procedure</a> will set out:</p>

<ul>
<li>who you should submit your appeal to</li>
  <li>the time limit within which an appeal must be made</li>
  <li>information about any meetings that will be held </li>
  <li>how the appeal meeting will be run</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the right to be accompanied during any appeal meetings. If possible, a manager who has not been involved in the process should handle the appeal.  </p>

<p>After the appeal meeting your employer should write to you setting out their final decision.</p>
