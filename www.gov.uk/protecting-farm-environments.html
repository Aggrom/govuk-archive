<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Climate change, pollution and demand for land can adversely affect the environment. You should manage your farming practices in a way that helps conserve and enhance the environment. There are several farming schemes that encourage good stewardship of the countryside by providing funding and support for farmers and land managers.</p>

<p>This guide gives an overview of how to reduce the impacts of your farming practices on the environment. It explains the benefits of protecting your farm’s environment, best practices for managing land, water, soil and crops, and how to use resources efficiently. It also gives links to useful organisations.</p>

<h2 id="land-management-and-cross-compliance">Land management and Cross Compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and other direct payments, eg the Environmental Stewardship schemes, you must meet all relevant Cross Compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions">GAECs</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> and <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions">GAECs</abbr>, see Cross Compliance: the basics, Statutory Management Requirements (SMR) and standards of good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC).</p>

<h3 id="gaec18---licensing-abstraction-of-water-for-irrigation-purposes">
<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 18 - licensing abstraction of water for irrigation purposes</h3>

<p>From 2010, the new <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 18 requires farmers who abstract water for irrigation purposes to comply with the existing abstraction licensing scheme run by the Environment Agency. The aim is to protect water resources.</p>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 18 applies to you if you abstract more than 20 cubic metres of water each day from inland water or an underground source. You can download <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 18 information from the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/183c01fd4e5556f18025767b00317313/%24FILE/GAEC%2018%202012%20v1.0.pdf">Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website (PDF, 783KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="sustainable-land-management-for-environmental-and-business-benefits">Sustainable land management for environmental and business benefits</h2>

<p>Whether called sustainable land management, environmental management or agri-environmental management, the long-term aim of sustainable land management is to slow climate change. Certainly wildlife habitats will benefit and biodiversity will flourish. Farmers have a major role to play and can indeed benefit from new farming opportunities arising as the environment changes. The more immediate and financial benefits for farmers mean that you are likely to:</p>

<ul>
<li>increase efficiency and productivity</li>
  <li>reduce costs</li>
  <li>attract more business</li>
  <li>improve your reputation amongst staff, customers and the public</li>
  <li>increase the chance of securing funding</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about sustainable business practices.</p>

<p>It is important to manage your farm in an environmentally friendly way to reduce its impact on the environment, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>air emissions</li>
  <li>land contamination</li>
  <li>waste production</li>
  <li>water pollution</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-stewardship">managing environmental resources.</a></p>

<h3 id="environmental-management-schemes">Environmental management schemes</h3>

<p>Several schemes encourage good stewardship of the countryside. The Rural Development Programme for England (<abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr>) is funded by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the UK government. The <abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr> provides financial support for capital and revenue projects, and training for farmers, growers, foresters, rural businesses, food businesses and rural communities.</p>

<p>For more information, see Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE).</p>

<p>The Environmental Stewardship Scheme in England provides funding to farmers and other land managers who effectively manage their land to modern environmental standards. The Environmental Stewardship Scheme, through three separate strands, aims to:</p>

<ul>
<li>conserve biodiversity</li>
  <li>maintain and enhance landscape quality and character</li>
  <li>protect the historic environment and natural resources</li>
  <li>promote public access and understanding of the countryside</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see Environmental Stewardship schemes.</p>

<h2 id="good-water-management-on-your-farm">Good water management on your farm</h2>

<p>In order to know how well you are managing your water - whether it comes from your own sources and/or from a supplier’s pipeline - you will want to know how much water you use and at what cost. Leaks in farm water supplies can cost around £33 a year for each dripping tap. Livestock farmers may also have the additional cost of extra slurry storage and application.</p>

<p>Water contaminated with bacteria or chemicals can harm livestock and people. Supplies can be contaminated through:</p>

<ul>
<li>leaks or open pipes</li>
  <li>unprotected storage tanks</li>
  <li>pollution of a spring, well or borehole</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple actions, such as dealing with leaks swiftly and cleaning your storage tanks, can reduce the risk of contamination, protect against sickness and avoid clean-up costs. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/32759.aspx">find good practice advice and case studies on how to save water on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<p>For more information, see air, water and soil quality: the basics and water pollution on farms.</p>

<h3 id="alternative-water-supplies">Alternative water supplies</h3>

<p>Water used on farms does not always have to come from the mains. You should consider using:</p>

<ul>
<li>recycled plate-cooler water - for washing down and for stock drinking</li>
  <li>water collected from roofs - for washing down and stock drinking</li>
  <li>ground and surface water - for stock drinking and irrigation</li>
  <li>stored water from winter abstraction or rainfall - for irrigation in drier months</li>
</ul>
<p>You should make sure that any alternative water supplies you use have a low risk of microbial and chemical contamination. For example, roof water could be contaminated with bird faeces, so you should use ultraviolet disinfection to remove contamination from roof water that you use for stock drinking.</p>

<h3 id="regulations-preventing-contamination-of-surface-groundwater-and-other-water-sources">Regulations preventing contamination of surface, groundwater and other water sources</h3>

<p>As a farmer or land manager, you must comply with regulations relating to certain activities and restrictions in, near or affecting water sources and the environment. They are based on the proximity of your land to watercourses and the type and scale of your farming activities - eg whether you keep livestock and/or use nitrogen fertilisers. The requirements are covered in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/water-pollution-on-farms">preventing water pollution,</a> water pollution on farms, Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF), Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ) and sewage sludge, slurry and silage.</p>

<h2 id="good-soil-management">Good soil management</h2>

<p>Well-managed soils are easier to cultivate and more likely to retain the water that crops need to thrive.</p>

<p>Well-structured soil is less vulnerable to erosion and runoff. Erosion will remove soil, nutrients and organic matter from your land and reduce the depth of your soil. It can also deposit soil on roads, wash away seeds, fertiliser and pesticides, and pollute rivers and streams with chemicals and sediment.</p>

<p>By managing your soils well, you can reduce the risk of losing valuable soil or water, and make significant savings in the long term. For more information, see soil use.</p>

<h3 id="nutrients">Nutrients</h3>

<p>Regular soil analysis and a nutrient management plan can help you to get the best out of the nutrients in your soil. It can also help to minimise nutrient losses through runoff or leaching into watercourses and groundwater.</p>

<h3 id="fertilisers">Fertilisers</h3>

<p>Manufactured fertilisers are an important part of farming. Rising prices mean you need to maximise the benefits of your fertilisers and make good use of manures and slurries.</p>

<p>If you use fertilisers correctly, you can improve crop nutrition, save money and reduce the risk of pollution. You should maintain and calibrate spreaders regularly so that you apply fertiliser accurately and evenly. For more information, see sewage sludge, slurry and silage and managing nutrients and fertilisers.</p>

<h3 id="nitrogen">Nitrogen</h3>

<p>You should use nitrates as efficiently as possible and try to minimise losses. In Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, farmers must comply with compulsory measures and rules. For more information, see the guide on Nitrate Vulnerable Zones.</p>

<h3 id="integrated-soil-management">Integrated soil management</h3>

<p>You can increase profits and minimise risk to the environment by combining traditional methods and advanced technologies. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>soil sampling and nutrient planning, field by field, allows you to treat each crop efficiently with no wastage</li>
  <li>minimum-till cultivation in the right soil and crop conditions protects and improves soil while saving time and fuel</li>
  <li>crop rotation helps control pests and diseases, reducing reliance on pesticides</li>
  <li>manure and compost make soil more fertile without using manufactured fertiliser</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent research into UK farming experience suggests that an integrated approach to agriculture, based on best environmental practice, can give significant savings by reducing nitrogen and pesticide inputs. It can also lead to a 20-30% reduction in variable costs.  </p>

<h2 id="good-crop-management">Good crop management</h2>

<p>Integrated crop management brings together various techniques to help reduce your costs and protect the environment. Crop rotation means you can reduce weeds, pests and diseases by interrupting their life cycles.</p>

<p>Some crops, such as brassicas, potatoes and sugar beet, need rotations to be longer than four years to control soil-borne pests and diseases. You can reduce the herbicide needed within a growing crop if you encourage annual weeds and volunteers to germinate and then treat them before drilling the crop.</p>

<p>For more information, see weed control and soil use.</p>

<h3 id="pesticides">Pesticides</h3>

<p>Pesticides are a serious chemical pollutant, but sometimes there are no other alternatives to resolving a specific disease, weed or pest problem. However, there are ways to keep your use of pesticides low, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>checking for problems and recording weed infestations to identify future problem areas</li>
  <li>using a Local Environment Risk Assessment for Pesticides where required</li>
  <li>establishing six-metre buffer strips next to watercourses and sensitive areas - to reduce applications and prevent pollution</li>
  <li>monitoring insect and disease levels using traps, bait and diagnostic kits - you should only take action when treatment thresholds are reached</li>
  <li>re-calibrating your sprayer each time you use it</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information, see managing wildlife and pests.</p>

<h3 id="grasslands">Grasslands</h3>

<p>Grassland supports a wide variety of wildlife and the sources of many lowland rivers are in grasslands. The uplands are important for storing and purifying our drinking water. They also serve as a natural buffer that helps to control flooding. By carefully managing grassland, you can avoid risking runoff caused by compaction from grazing in wet weather.</p>

<p>For more information on managing this type of land, see the guides on heather and grass burning and grazing and pasture.</p>

<p>Farmers and land managers have a responsibility to protect the wider environment, especially in designated areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). For more information, see the guide on Sites of Special Scientific Interest and historical monuments.</p>

<h2 id="energy-efficiency-and-effective-resource-management-on-the-farm">Energy efficiency and effective resource management on the farm</h2>

<p>Minimising waste can cut costs and be beneficial to the environment.</p>

<h3 id="waste-management">Waste management</h3>

<p>Carrying out a waste audit is a useful way to identify where you can avoid producing waste and can help you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make better use of materials</li>
  <li>manage your waste responsibly</li>
  <li>recycle or re-use materials - such as packaging</li>
  <li>consider alternative materials and techniques</li>
  <li>save money</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not burn, bury, dump or tip waste unless you have a permit or have registered an exemption. For more information, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview">duty of care - your waste responsibilities</a>, minimising farm waste, composting and recycling, hazardous waste: treatment and disposal and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview">waste reviews, policies and action plans</a>.</p>

<h3 id="saving-energy">Saving energy</h3>

<p>There are a number of simple ways to reduce energy usage on your land, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintaining your equipment in good condition and using it efficiently to ensure it only needs the minimum of energy to operate</li>
  <li>ensuring that buildings on your land are designed to retain heat in winter</li>
  <li>adjusting vehicle tyre pressures on your farm according to task and ground conditions in order to use less fuel</li>
  <li>replacing incandescent bulbs with low-energy lighting for your farm</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="producing-your-own-energy">Producing your own energy</h3>
