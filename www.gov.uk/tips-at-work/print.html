  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you get tips at work, they don’t count towards the <a href="/national-minimum-wage-rates" title="National Minimum Wage">National Minimum Wage</a>, but you do have to pay tax on them.</p>

<h2>How tips are paid</h2>

<p>You could get your tips as:</p>

<ul>
<li>cash at the end of a shift or from a customer</li>
  <li>part of your pay packet</li>
  <li>an amount that’s pooled and shared between all staff - this is called a ‘tronc’ and the person who looks after it is called the ‘troncmaster’</li>
</ul>
<h2>How your employer handles tips</h2>

<p>The government has a ‘Code of Best Practice’ on tips that says how your employer should handle them. </p>

<p>It’s voluntary - your employer doesn’t have to follow it - but if they do, they should have a policy on tips that includes information on:</p>

<ul>
<li>how tips are distributed (eg if a tronc is used)</li>
  <li>if cash and card tips are treated differently</li>
  <li>the name of the troncmaster (if there is one)</li>
  <li>any deductions taken from tips</li>
  <li>what happens during leave (eg holidays, sick leave, parental leave)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to get help</h2>

<p>If you have a question about tips or the National Minimum Wage, call the Pay and Work Rights Helpline:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Pay and Work Rights Helpline</strong><br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 0800 917 2368<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 0800 121 4042<br>
Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm<br>
Saturday, 9am to 1pm</p>
</div>

<p>Make an enquiry using the online Pay and Work Rights <a rel="external" href="https://payandworkrights.direct.gov.uk/" title="Pay and Work Rights enquiry form">general enquiry form</a></p>

<p>Use the Pay and Work Rights <a rel="external" href="https://payandworkrights.direct.gov.uk/complaints/" title="Pay and Work Rights complaints form">complaints form.</a></p>

</article><article id="tips-and-tax"><header><h1>Part 2: Tips and tax</h1>
  </header><p>You have to pay <a href="/income-tax" title="Income Tax">Income Tax</a> on any tips you get, and sometimes <a href="/national-insurance" title="National Insurance">National Insurance</a> contributions as well. </p>

<p>How your tax is worked out, and whether you have to pay National Insurance, depends on who:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tips are given to</li>
  <li>decides how the tips are shared out</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cash tips paid directly to you</h2>

<p>If you get cash tips directly from a customer, you have to pay tax on them but not National Insurance. </p>

<p>If you fill in a <a href="/file-your-self-assessment-tax-return" title="Self Assessment">Self Assessment</a> tax return, you have to include the tips on it.</p>

<p>If you don’t fill out a tax return then HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will estimate your tips based on information from you or your employer. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will give your employer a tax code so they can collect tax through Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>). This is where tax is taken from your wages before you get them. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you think your tax code is wrong, <a href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?sr=0&amp;as=1&amp;cs=ISO-8859-1&amp;sc=hmrc&amp;sf=&amp;sm=0&amp;nh=50&amp;ha=34&amp;tx0=49612&amp;fl0=__dsid:&amp;tx1=2037&amp;raction=view" title="contact HMRC" rel="external">contact <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Tips included in card or cheque payments</h2>

<p>If your employer pays these to you directly, they’re responsible for making sure Income Tax is paid through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. </p>

<p>Sometimes the tips are pooled together and shared out - this is called a ‘tronc’. The person who looks after it is called the ‘troncmaster’ and they are responsible for making sure Income Tax is paid. </p>

<p>If your employer decides how the tips are shared out, National Insurance is due as well as tax. Your employer is responsible for making sure it’s paid through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your employer has to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if there’s a tronc and who the troncmaster is.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re the troncmaster, you can get help on what to do from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/bst/advice-teams-area/map2.htm" title="Business Education and Support Team">Business Education and Support Team</a> in your area. There’s also a leaflet to help you.</p>

<div class="form-download">

</div>

<h2>Service charges</h2>

<p>These are added to the bill before it’s given to the customer. </p>

<p>If the charge is compulsory, it’s not a tip so if your employer gives it to you, it’s treated in the same way as your wages. </p>

<p>If it’s voluntary, you pay tax and National Insurance in the same way as for tips.</p>

<h2>Bonuses</h2>

<p>These are part of your pay and you’ll pay tax and National Insurance on them through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. </p>
