  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The Court Funds Office looks after money when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Court of Protection decides someone is unable to make their own decisions</li>
  <li>a child is awarded damages as a result of civil legal action</li>
  <li>a civil case is waiting to be settled</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone under 18 will have a ‘Litigation Friend’ (usually a parent or guardian) appointed by the court to look after their account.</p>

<p>The Court of Protection will usually appoint a deputy to look after an account if someone is unable to make their own decisions. The deputy will have certain responsibilities and powers that the court will make clear to them.</p>

</article><article id="accounts-and-investments"><header><h1>Part 2: Accounts and investments</h1>
  </header><p>The Court Funds Office can hold money in an account or invest some of the money on the stock market.</p>

<h2>Accounts</h2>

<p>Money held for a child or someone who is unable to make their own decisions is held in a ‘special account’. </p>

<p>Money being held until a civil case is settled is held in a ‘basic account’.</p>

<p>The special and basic accounts pay different rates of interest:</p>

<ul>
<li>special account: 0.5% </li>
  <li>basic account: 0.3%</li>
</ul>
<p>Tax will have to be paid if the interest on the account is more than the person’s tax allowance.</p>

<p>Only a deputy appointed by the Court of Protection or a Litigation Friend can access a Court Funds Office account for someone else.</p>

<p>Money will be held in a Court Funds Office account for a child until they are 18, unless a court order says otherwise. The Court Funds Office will write to the child 1 month before their 18th birthday and explain how they can get their money.</p>

<h2>Statements</h2>

<p>The Court Funds Office sends out annual statements for special accounts at the end of April. </p>

<p>Another statement is issued in October for all accounts that:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a balance of £100,000 or more and are being held for a child</li>
  <li>are being being held for Court of Protection clients</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask for a statement at any time by contacting the Court Funds Office:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Court Funds Office</strong><br><a href="mailto:enquiries@courtfunds.gsi.gov.uk" title="enquiries@courtfunds.gsi.gov.uk">enquiries@courtfunds.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Investments</h2>

<p>The Court Funds Office can make stock market investments in a range of companies using the Equity Tracker Index Fund (ETIF). </p>

<p>They will invest money if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the money is being held on behalf of a child or someone unable to make decisions for themselves</li>
  <li>the amount of money being held is £10,000 or more</li>
  <li>the money is likely to be held for 5 or more years</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of money invested is based on instructions from the Court of Protection, a deputy or an investment manager appointed by a deputy.</p>

<p>If any investments are sold for more than their original value, tax may also be payable. This may also happen if the difference in value is more than the person’s Capital Gains Tax allowance.</p>
