</header><article id="how-to-get-help"><header><h1>Part 1: How to get help</h1>
  </header><p>If you need to get child maintenance from an ex-partner who lives abroad, the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) or other organisations might be able to help you depending on your circumstances.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The parent the child doesn’t live with is called the ‘paying parent’. The parent or person the child lives with is called the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>When the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can help</h2>

<p>If the paying parent lives abroad, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can only help if they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a civil servant</li>
  <li>working in Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service</li>
  <li>a member of the Armed Forces</li>
  <li>working for a company that is based and registered in the UK</li>
  <li>working on secondment for a ‘prescribed body’, like a regional health authority or local authority</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://www2.dwp.gov.uk/csa/v2/en/contact/index.asp" title="contact the CSA">Contact the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr></a> for more information on how it can help.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you live in the UK and the paying parent lives in Australia, the <a href="http://www.csa.gov.au/" title="Australian CSA" rel="external">Australian <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr></a> might be able to help.</p>
</div>

<h2>If one of you lives in the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</h2>

<p>By law, <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="list of EU countries"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</a> must enforce:</p>

<ul>
<li>court orders for child maintenance</li>
  <li>decisions made by the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the following must apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>one of you lives in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the other lives in the UK</li>
  <li>the paying parent has valuable assets located in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> - eg property, cars or money</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries can also make paying parents pay <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> debts if the money owed was from when both parents lived in the UK.</p>
</div>

<h2>If the paying parent lives outside of Australia and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you have a court order for child maintenance you can try to get this enforced in a foreign country. You can also ask foreign authorities to create a court order for you. </p>

<p>To do this, contact your local magistrates’ court (sheriff court in Scotland) using the links below: </p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="find a court - England and Wales">Find a court - England and Wales</a></li>

</ul></article><article id="reciprocal-enforcement-of-maintenance-orders-remos"><header><h1>Part 2: Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMOs)</h1>
  </header><p>These are international agreements about child maintenance. The UK has them with over 100 countries. </p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Order">REMO</abbr> is in place, it means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>child maintenance orders made by UK courts can be registered and enforced in other countries</li>
  <li>child maintenance orders made in foreign countries can be registered and enforced by UK courts</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to try and put a <abbr title="Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Order">REMO</abbr> in place, you need to do one of the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>contact the court where the order was made if you already have a court order for child maintenance</li>
  <li>contact your local magistrates’ court (sheriff court in Scotland) if you haven’t got a court order</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens next depends on where you live.</p>

<h3>If you live in England or Wales</h3>

<p>The court will send your case to the <abbr title="Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Order">REMO</abbr> unit, which deals with the foreign court on your behalf. You don’t need a solicitor.</p>

<p>You can find out more about <abbr title="Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders">REMOs</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/protecting-the-vulnerable/official-solicitor/" title="Official Solicitor website">Official Solicitor website.</a> </p>

<h3>If you live in Scotland</h3>

<p>If a court order already exists, the court that made it will send your case to the Justice Directorate.</p>

<p>If a court order doesn’t exist, you can get one by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>applying to your local sheriff court</li>
  <li>applying directly to the court in the country the other parent has moved to</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to use a solicitor. Some of the <abbr title="Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Order">REMO</abbr> arrangements other countries have with the UK don’t apply to Scotland.</p>
