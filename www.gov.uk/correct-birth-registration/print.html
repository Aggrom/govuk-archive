  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-corrections-can-be-made"><header><h1>Part 1: What corrections can be made</h1>
  </header><p>Corrections to a birth registration can only be made when the information is wrong (eg a mistake was made when recording a parent’s occupation). </p>

<p>You can’t apply for a correction to show new information if circumstances change after you’ve registered your child’s birth (eg you change your name after getting married again). </p>

<p>However, you can apply to re-register the birth if the natural parents get married at a later date.</p>

<h2>Who to apply to</h2>
<p>You can either apply for a correction to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>the register office where your child’s birth was registered - for minor mistakes in a parent’s occupation, birthplace or address </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) - for mistakes involving things like names </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re unsure who to apply to, contact the relevant <a href="/register-offices" title="Find your register office">register office</a> or the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Removing the wrong father’s details</h2>

<p>You can only apply to change who the father is if a DNA test proves (or a court order says) that the man named on the certificate isn’t the natural father.  </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must apply to the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr> for this type of change.</p>
</div>

<h2>What happens if you change gender</h2>

<p>If your gender change is <a href="/apply-gender-recognition-certificate/changing-your-gender" title="Applying for a gender recognition certificate">approved</a>, you’ll get a new, free short birth certificate with your new gender on it.</p>

<h2>What the correction looks like</h2>
<p>If your application is approved, a correction is made in the register in the office for the area where your child was born.</p>

<p>The original information will always be shown in the register. After the correction has been authorised, a note will be added to the margin of the register. This will explain what the correct information is and when the correction was made. </p>

<p>All full birth certificates that are issued from this time will include the note in the margin.</p>

<p>Short birth certificates only include the child’s details and won’t have a note in the margin - they’ll just include any correct new details. </p>


</article><article id="who-can-apply"><header><h1>Part 2: Who can apply</h1>
  </header><p>The following people can apply for a correction:</p>

<ul>
<li>the mother</li>
  <li>the father (if his details are on the certificate)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re applying to change a child’s name and both parents are named on the certificate, both must sign the application form.</p>
</div>

<p>The child named on the certificate may be able to apply for a correction if their parents aren’t available. </p>

<h2>Removing the wrong father’s details</h2>

<p>It’s not always necessary for the named father to take part in the correction process. The General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) can correct the entry if 2 of the following people <a href="/correct-birth-registration/how-to-apply" title="How to apply">apply to have it changed</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>the mother</li>
  <li>the natural father</li>
  <li>the man named on the birth certificate as the father</li>
</ul>
<p>At least 1 of these must sign the application form. </p>

<p>You need to provide the contact addresses for the mother, the man named as the father on the certificate and the true biological father (if he took part in a DNA test). </p>


</article><article id="how-to-apply"><header><h1>Part 3: How to apply</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re applying to the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>), you must fill in the relevant application form.</p>

</div>

<p>If your local register office is making the correction, make an appointment with them - you won’t need an application form. </p>

<h2>Proving the registration is wrong</h2>

<p>You’ll need to show that the information given at the time of the registration was wrong. You must send in documents with your application that show what the correct information should have been. These documents should be valid or dated around the time your child was born.</p>

<p>Documents you can send in include a:</p>

<ul>
<li>passport</li>
  <li>photocard driving licence</li>
  <li>bank, building society or credit card statement</li>
  <li>letter from a hospital or doctor</li>
  <li>letter from a government department</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you can’t send in proof, corrections can’t usually be made.</p>
</div>

<h3>Proof the wrong father is on the certificate</h3>
<p>You’ll need to prove that the man named on the certificate isn’t the child’s natural father. You must send in a DNA test record from <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/paternity-testing/paternity-test" title="Accredited list for court-directed paternity testing">an approved tester</a> or a court order that either says:</p>

<ul>
<li>the man named on the certificate isn’t the father</li>
  <li>who is the true biological father</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sending in certified documents</h2>
<p>You should only send in documents that have been <a href="/certifying-a-document" title="Certifying a document">certified</a> as true copies of the original.</p>

<h2>Witnessing the correction</h2>
<p>If the correction is being made at your register office, you need to arrange an appointment with them. When you go in you’ll witness the correction and sign the note made in the birth register.</p>

<p>If you’re applying to the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr> to make the correction, you can say on the application form if you want to witness the correction. </p>

<h3>Statutory declaration</h3>
<p>If you’re applying to correct a serious mistake (eg in the name of a person), the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr> may ask you to make a ‘statutory declaration’ about the correction and send it to them. This means you have to make a legal statement in front of someone like a judge or solicitor that they must sign (sometimes called ‘attesting an oath’). </p>

<p>If you make a statutory declaration, you won’t have to witness the correction.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You may have to pay a fee for a statutory declaration</p>
</div>

<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>There isn’t any charge for correcting a birth record. However, if you want a <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate" title="Order a copy of a birth,death or marriage certificate">new certificate</a> showing the correct details, you’ll need to pay a fee.</p>

<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>If you want further advice on applying to make a correction, contact the <a href="/register-offices" title="Find your register office">register office</a> or the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>.</p>
