    <section role="main"><header><h1>Wills, probate and inheritance, a guide from GOV.UK</h1>
  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>When someone dies you may be able to apply for a ‘grant of representation’. This is the legal right to deal with the person’s property, money and possessions (their ‘estate’).</p>

<p>You can apply yourself or use a solicitor.</p>

<p>In most cases, the basic process is as follows:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Check if there’s a will</strong> - this normally states who sorts out the estate; if there’s no will the next of kin can apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply to get a ‘grant of representation’</strong> - this gives you the legal right to access things like the person’s bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay Inheritance Tax</strong> - this is only paid if the estate’s worth over a certain amount and is part of applying for a grant of representation - once you’ve paid any tax due, you can collect the assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collect the assets</strong> - eg money from the sale of the person’s property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay any debts</strong> - eg unpaid utilities bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribute the estate</strong> - this means giving any property, money or possessions to the people entitled to it (‘beneficiaries’).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>When a grant of representation may not be needed</h2>

<p>You don’t normally need a grant if the estate:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>passes to the surviving spouse/civil partner because it was held in
<a href="joint-property-and-bank-accounts" title="Assets held in joint names">joint names</a> – eg a savings account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>doesn’t include land, property or shares</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You should contact the organisation holding the money - eg the bank or building society. They may ask for proof of death - eg the death certificate following the <a href="/after-a-death/register-the-death" title="What to do when someone dies">registration of death</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Each financial institution has its own rules - you may still need to apply for a grant.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-the-person-left-a-will"><header><h1>Part 2: If the person left a will</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a grant of representation if you’re the ‘executor’ of the will - the person named to deal with the estate.</p>

<p>If more than one executor is named in the will, the <a href="applying-for-a-grant-of-representation" title="Applying for a grant of representation">probate application form and guidance notes</a> explain what to do.</p>

<p>You should contact your local <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=744" title="Contact your Probate Registry">Probate Registry</a> if either:</p>

<ul>
<li>no executor is named in the will</li>
  <li>none of the named executors are willing or able to apply</li>
</ul>
<p>The Probate Registry will explain what you need to do.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>An executor doesn’t necessarily get any of the estate.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-the-person-didnt-leave-a-will"><header><h1>Part 3: If the person didn't leave a will</h1>
  </header><p>The person’s next of kin - eg the spouse (or civil partner) or children - can usually apply for a grant of representation.</p>

<p>If there’s no will, <a href="http://www.gov.uk/inherits-someone-dies-without-will" title="Who inherits if someone dies without a will">the law decides who inherits the estate</a>.</p>

<h2>Partners and ex-partners</h2>

<p>If you’re the partner of the person who’s died but weren’t married to them (or in a civil partnership) you can’t apply. You’re also not automatically entitled to get any of your partner’s estate. You should get legal advice to find out about your rights.</p>

<p>If the person was separated but not yet divorced (or had their civil partnership dissolved), their spouse (or civil partner) would inherit some or all of the estate - and must apply for the grant.</p>

</article><article id="joint-property-and-bank-accounts"><header><h1>Part 4: Joint property and bank accounts</h1>
  </header><h2>Joint bank and savings accounts</h2>

<p>If you have a joint account with the person, what’s in it automatically passes to you. You don’t need a grant of representation.</p>

<h2>Joint property</h2>

<p>What happens to the person’s property depends on how it was owned. If the property was:</p>

<ul>
<li>held under ‘joint tenancy’ - the surviving owner inherits the whole property automatically</li>
  <li>owned as a ‘tenancy in common’ - the person’s will (or the law, if there’s no will) states who inherits their share</li>
  <li>owned outright by the person - the terms of their will(s) state who inherits (or the law of intestacy if there’s no will)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re unsure of how a property is owned, contact the mortgage company, the <a href="http://www.landreg.gov.uk/" title="Land Registry" rel="external">Land Registry</a> or get legal advice.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="applying-for-a-grant-of-representation"><header><h1>Part 5: Applying for a grant of representation</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a grant of representation yourself or use a solicitor.</p>

<p>To apply, you must:</p>

<h2>Complete a probate application form</h2>

<p>You can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>call the Probate and Inheritance Tax helpline - 0845 302 0900 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm)</li>
  <li>fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=735" title="probate application form PA1">probate application form PA1</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Probate and Inheritance Tax helpline can help you fill the form in.</p>
</div>

<h2>Complete an Inheritance Tax form</h2>

<p>You must also <a href="/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died" title="Valuing the estate of someone who's died">work out how much the estate is worth</a>. Depending on its value, there may be tax to pay - called Inheritance Tax.</p>

<p>You must complete an Inheritance Tax form - even if you think no tax is owed.</p>

<p>Find the correct <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/ihtforms.page#4020" title="Find the correct Inheritance Tax form">Inheritance Tax form.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If there is tax to pay, you normally have to pay at least some of it before a grant is issued to you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Send off your application</h2>

<p>Send off your application, which should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the probate application form PA1</li>
  <li>the Inheritance Tax form</li>
  <li>an official copy of the <a href="/after-a-death/register-the-death" title="What to do after a death">death certificate</a>
</li>
  <li>the original will and 2 copies - and any codicils (additions or amendments to it)</li>
  <li>the application fee of £105 - a cheque made payable to HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service (there’s no fee if the estate is under £5,000)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can pay for extra copies of the grant (£1 each) - this means you can send them to different organisations at the same time.</p>
</div>

<h2>Swear an oath</h2>

<p>You may need to go to a local probate office to swear an oath - this is a ‘promise’ that the information you’ve given is true to the best of your knowledge.</p>

<p>You must bring 2 items of identification with you - like a:</p>

<ul>
<li>full driving licence</li>
  <li>passport</li>
</ul>
<p>You should get the grant through the post within 10 working days of swearing the oath.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If it’s not possible to issue a grant, the Probate Service will explain why in writing.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="once-the-grants-been-issued"><header><h1>Part 6: Once the grant's been issued</h1>
  </header><h2>Contact organisations to get hold of the person’s assets</h2>

<p>You should send a copy of the grant to relevant organisations (eg the person’s bank). They should then ‘release’ the assets so you can transfer them into the executorship account.</p>

<p>If the person had a pension, contact the organisation - a surviving spouse (or civil partner) may be entitled to money from it.</p>

<h2>Pay any debts or outstanding payments</h2>

<p>Once you’ve contacted all the organisations, pay off any debts the person had. This could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>outstanding bills</li>
  <li>tax owed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use money collected from the estate to pay any solicitor’s fees - as part of the probate process.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>As the executor or administrator you have a legal responsibility to pay off any debts or outstanding payments before distributing the estate.</p>
</div>

<h2>Distribute the estate</h2>

<p>Once all debts and and taxes have been paid, you can distribute the estate as detailed:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the will</li>
  <li>using the laws of intestacy, if there’s no will</li>
</ul>
<p>After this you should prepare the estate accounts. These must be approved and signed by you and the main beneficiaries.</p>

</article><article id="if-you-inherit-property"><header><h1>Part 7: If you inherit property</h1>
  </header><p>If you inherit property - eg from your parents - you have responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Selling the property</h3>

<p>You may have to pay tax on any profit you make when you sell it. Get advice from <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?sr=0&amp;as=1&amp;cs=ISO-8859-1&amp;sc=hmrc&amp;sf=&amp;sm=0&amp;nh=50&amp;ha=34&amp;tx0=49647&amp;fl0=__dsid:&amp;tx1=2037&amp;raction=view" title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</a> </p>

<h3>If you keep the property</h3>

<p>If you already own a home you need to nominate one of your homes as your main home - let your Tax Office know. You can only have relief from <a href="/capital-gains-tax" title="Capital Gains Tax">Capital Gains Tax</a> for your main home.</p>

<p>You should also register your ownership at the <a href="/registering-land-or-property-with-land-registry" title="Land Registry">Land Registry</a> - although legally you don’t have to do this unless the property’s sold or mortgaged.</p>

<h3>If another owner is still living there</h3>

<p>If another owner is still living there you need to agree with them whether:</p>

<ul>
<li>they will continue living there</li>
  <li>the property will be sold</li>
</ul>
<p>Their right to remain may be stated in the will, if there is one.</p>

<h3>Renting the property</h3>

<p>You may have to pay <a href="/income-tax" title="Income tax">tax</a> on the rental income you make. Get advice from the Tax Office.</p>

<p>If you inherit a property that has a tenant, you have responsibilities as a landlord - especially if you want to sell the property.</p>
