  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>When someone dies, you may be able to apply for a ‘grant of representation’. This gives you the legal right to deal with the person’s property, money and possessions (their ‘estate’). The right to deal with the estate of someone who’s died is called ‘probate’.</p>

<p>You can apply yourself or use a solicitor. </p>

<p>In most cases, the basic process is as follows:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Check if there’s a will</strong> - this normally states who sorts out the estate; if there’s no will the next of kin can apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply to get a ‘grant of representation’</strong> - this gives you the legal right to access things like the person’s bank account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay Inheritance Tax</strong> - this is only paid if the estate’s worth over £325,000 and is part of applying for a grant of representation - once you’ve paid any tax due, you can collect the assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collect the assets</strong> - eg money from the sale of the person’s property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay any debts</strong> - eg unpaid utilities bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribute the estate</strong> - this means giving any property, money or possessions to the people entitled to it (‘beneficiaries’).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>When a grant of representation may not be needed</h2>

<p>You don’t normally need a grant if the estate:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>passes to the surviving spouse/civil partner because it was held in
<a href="/wills-probate-inheritance/joint-property-and-bank-accounts" title="Assets held in joint names">joint names</a> – eg a savings account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>doesn’t include land, property or shares</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You should contact the organisation holding the money - eg the bank or building society. They may ask for proof of death - eg the death certificate after the death has been <a href="/after-a-death/register-the-death" title="What to do when someone dies">registered</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Each financial institution has its own rules - you may still need to apply for a grant.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-the-person-left-a-will"><header><h1>Part 2: If the person left a will</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a grant of representation if you’re the ‘executor’ of the will - the person named to deal with the estate.</p>

<p>If more than one executor is named in the will, the <a href="applying-for-a-grant-of-representation" title="Applying for a grant of representation">probate application form and guidance notes</a> explain what to do.</p>

<p>You should contact your local <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=744" title="Contact your Probate Registry">Probate Registry</a> if either:</p>

<ul>
<li>no executor is named in the will</li>
  <li>none of the named executors are willing or able to apply</li>
</ul>
<p>The Probate Registry will explain what you need to do.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>An executor doesn’t necessarily get any of the estate.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-the-person-didnt-leave-a-will"><header><h1>Part 3: If the person didn't leave a will</h1>
  </header><p>The person’s next of kin - eg the spouse (or civil partner) or children - can usually apply for a grant of representation.</p>

<p>If there’s no will, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inherits-someone-dies-without-will" title="Who inherits if someone dies without a will">the law decides who inherits the estate</a>.</p>

<h2>Partners and ex-partners</h2>

<p>If you’re the partner of the person who’s died but weren’t married to them (or in a civil partnership) you can’t apply. You’re also not automatically entitled to get any of your partner’s estate. You should get legal advice to find out about your rights.</p>

<p>If the person was separated but not yet divorced (or had their civil partnership dissolved), their spouse (or civil partner) would inherit some or all of the estate - and must apply for the grant.</p>

</article><article id="joint-property-and-bank-accounts"><header><h1>Part 4: Joint property and bank accounts</h1>
  </header><h2>Joint bank and savings accounts</h2>

<p>If you have a joint account with the person, what’s in it automatically passes to you. You don’t need a grant of representation.</p>

<h2>Joint property</h2>

<p>What happens to the person’s property depends on how it was owned. If the property was:</p>

<ul>
<li>held under ‘joint tenancy’ - the surviving owner inherits the whole property automatically</li>
  <li>owned as a ‘tenancy in common’ - the person’s will (or the law <a href="/inherits-someone-dies-without-will" title="Who inherits if someone dies without a will?">if there’s no will)</a> states who inherits their share</li>
  <li>owned outright by the person - the terms of their will(s) state who inherits (or the law <a href="/inherits-someone-dies-without-will" title="Who inherits if someone dies without a will?">if there’s no will)</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re unsure of how a property is owned, contact the mortgage company, the <a href="http://www.landreg.gov.uk/" title="Land Registry" rel="external">Land Registry</a> or get legal advice.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="applying-for-a-grant-of-representation"><header><h1>Part 5: Applying for a grant of representation</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a grant of representation yourself or use a solicitor. There are 4 steps.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Complete a probate application form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete an Inheritance Tax form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send off your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swear an oath.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Find out more about each step below. </p>

<h2>Complete a probate application form</h2>

<p>You can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=735" title="probate application form PA1">probate application form PA1</a> yourself</li>
  <li>call the Probate and Inheritance Tax helpline - 0845 302 0900 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Probate and Inheritance Tax helpline can help you fill in the form.</p>
</div>

<h2>Complete an Inheritance Tax form</h2>

<p>You must also <a href="/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died" title="Valuing the estate of someone who's died">work out how much the estate is worth</a>. Depending on its value, there may be tax to pay - called Inheritance Tax.</p>

<p>You must complete an Inheritance Tax form - even if you think no tax is owed.</p>

<p>Find the correct <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/ihtforms.page#4020" title="Find the correct Inheritance Tax form">Inheritance Tax form.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If there is tax to pay, you normally have to pay at least some of it before a grant of representation is issued to you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Send off your application</h2>

<p>Send off your application, which should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the probate application form PA1</li>
  <li>the Inheritance Tax form</li>
  <li>an official copy of the <a href="/after-a-death/register-the-death" title="What to do after a death">death certificate</a>
</li>
  <li>the original will and 2 copies - and any codicils (additions or amendments to it)</li>
  <li>the application fee of £105 - a cheque made payable to HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service (there’s no fee if the estate is under £5,000)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can pay for extra copies of the grant (£1 each) - this means you can send them to different organisations at the same time.</p>
</div>

<h2>Swear an oath</h2>

<p>You’ll need to go to a local probate office to swear an oath.</p>

<p>This is a ‘promise’ that the information you’ve given is true to the best of your knowledge.</p>

<p>You must bring 2 items of identification with you - like a:</p>

<ul>
<li>full driving licence</li>
  <li>passport</li>
</ul>
<p>You should get the grant through the post within 10 working days of swearing the oath.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If it’s not possible to issue a grant, the Probate Service will explain why in writing.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="once-the-grants-been-issued"><header><h1>Part 6: Once the grant's been issued</h1>
  </header><h2>Contact organisations to get hold of the person’s assets</h2>

<p>You should send a copy of the grant to relevant organisations (eg the person’s bank). They should then ‘release’ the assets so you can transfer them into the executorship account.</p>

<p>If the person had a pension, contact the organisation - a surviving spouse (or civil partner) may be entitled to money from it.</p>

<h2>Pay any debts or outstanding payments</h2>

<p>Once you’ve contacted all the organisations, pay off any debts the person had. This could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>outstanding bills</li>
  <li>tax owed</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>As the executor or administrator you have a legal responsibility to pay off any debts or outstanding payments before distributing the estate. You can use money from the estate to pay any solicitor’s fees as part of the probate process.</p>
</div>

<h2>Distribute the estate</h2>

<p>Once all debts and and taxes have been paid, you can distribute the estate as detailed:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the will</li>
  <li>using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inherits-someone-dies-without-will" title="Who inherits if someone dies without a will">law</a>, if there’s no will</li>
</ul>
<p>After this you should prepare the estate accounts. These must be approved and signed, by both you and the main beneficiaries.</p>

</article><article id="if-you-inherit-property"><header><h1>Part 7: If you inherit property</h1>
  </header><p>If you inherit property - eg from your parents - you have responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Selling the property</h3>

<p>You may have to pay tax on any profit you make when you sell it. Get advice from the HM Revenue &amp; Customs Deceased Estate Helpline.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Trusts and deceased estates helpline</strong></p>

<p>0845 604 6455
Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</p>
</div>

<h3>If you keep the property</h3>

<p>If you already own a home you need to nominate one of your homes as your main home - let your Tax Office know. You can only have relief from <a href="/capital-gains-tax" title="Capital Gains Tax">Capital Gains Tax</a> for your main home.</p>

<p>You should also register your ownership at the <a href="/registering-land-or-property-with-land-registry" title="Land Registry">Land Registry</a> - although legally you don’t have to do this unless the property’s sold or mortgaged.</p>

<h3>If another owner is still living there</h3>

<p>If another owner is still living there you need to agree with them whether:</p>

<ul>
<li>they will continue living there</li>
  <li>the property will be sold</li>
</ul>
<p>Their right to remain may be stated in the will, if there is one.</p>

<h3>Renting the property</h3>

<p>You may have to pay <a href="/income-tax" title="Income tax">tax</a> on the rental income you make. Get advice from the Tax Office.</p>

<p>If you inherit a property that has a tenant, you have <a href="/renting-out-a-property/landlord-responsibilities" title="Renting out your property">responsibilities as a landlord</a> - especially if you want to sell the property.</p>
