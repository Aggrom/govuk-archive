  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can choose to liquidate your limited company. </p>

<p>Liquidating a company means its assets are used to pay off its debts - any money left goes to shareholders. After liquidation, your company won’t exist.</p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of voluntary liquidation:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/liquidate-your-company/creditors-voluntary-liquidation" title="Creditors' voluntary liquidation">creditors’ voluntary liquidation</a> - you choose to liquidate your company because it can’t pay its debts</li>
  <li>
<a href="/liquidate-your-company/members-voluntary-liquidation" title="Members voluntary liquidation">members’ voluntary liquidation</a> - your company can pay its debts but you want to close it</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your company may be forced into <a href="/protecting-company-from-compulsory-liquidation" title="compulsory liquidation">compulsory liquidation</a> if it can’t pay its debts.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="members-voluntary-liquidation"><header><h1>Part 2: Members' voluntary liquidation</h1>
  </header><p>You may choose members’ voluntary liquidation if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you want to retire</li>
  <li>you want to step down from the family business and nobody else wants to run it</li>
  <li>the business has run its course</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you start, you (the director) must publicly declare your company is ‘solvent’ (can pay its debts) by making a ‘members’ declaration of solvency’.</p>

<h2>Members’ declaration of solvency</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Get form 4.70 ‘Members voluntary winding up declaration of solvency’ from a legal stationer - or in Scotland, get form 4.25 (Scot) from the <a href="http://www.aib.gov.uk/services/liquidation" title="Accountant in Bankruptcy - liquidation forms (Scotland)" rel="external">Accountant in Bankruptcy.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill in the declaration - it must be signed by the majority of directors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send the declaration to Companies House.</p>
</li>
</ol>
