  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing company vans and fuel to your employees, you have certain National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>This includes any van used for:</p>

<ul>
<li>business journeys</li>
  <li>commuting</li>
  <li>private journeys</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report or pay anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if your van is used in one of the ways listed below.</p>

<h2>Business journeys and commuting</h2>

<p>A business journey is a trip:</p>

<ul>
<li>made as part of work (eg a service engineer travelling between appointments)</li>
  <li>to a temporary workplace</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Vans used for ‘insignificant’ private journeys are exempt, eg making a slight detour to pick up a newspaper on the way to work.</p>
</div>

<h2>Private journeys</h2>

<p>Vans and fuel used for private journeys are exempt if your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year.</p>

<h2>Pool vans</h2>

<p>You won’t need to report your van if it’s all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>available for use and used by more than 1 employee</li>
  <li>available to each employee because they need it to do their job</li>
  <li>not ordinarily used by 1 employee to the exclusion of others</li>
  <li>not normally kept at or near employees’ homes</li>
  <li>used only for business journeys – limited private use is allowed, but only if it’s incidental to a business journey, eg driving home to allow an early start the next morning</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If your van isn’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-company-vans/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you must report it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and pay National Insurance on it.</p>

  </header><h2>Vans used for private journeys</h2>

<p>There’s a standard value of £3,000 that you’ll need to report. This can be reduced if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your employee can’t use the van for 30 days in a row </li>
  <li>your employee pays you to privately use the van</li>
  <li>other employees use the van - divide £3,000 by the number of employees </li>
</ul>
<h2>Van fuel for private journeys</h2>

<p>There’s a standard value of £550 that you’ll need to report. This can be reduced if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the employee can’t use the van for 30 days in a row </li>
  <li>your employee pays you back for all their private fuel</li>
  <li>you stopped providing fuel during the tax year </li>
</ul>
<h2>Calculating your reductions</h2>
<p>Most payroll software packages will work the reductions out for you. </p>
