<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must take your signed driving licence and a valid passport if you have an old-style paper licence.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="rules-for-the-car-you-use"><header><h1>Part 3: Rules for the car you use</h1>

<ul>
<li>be taxed, insured and have a valid MOT if it needs one</li>
  <li>be a saloon, hatchback or estate car with a rigid roof</li>
  <li>be in a roadworthy and clean condition</li>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Your test will be cancelled and you’ll lose your fee if your car doesn’t meet the rules.</p>
</div>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>The examiner will be driving your car, so the car insurance must cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>the examiner’s liability for all third-party and damage risks</li>
  <li>liability to all passengers</li>
  <li>any Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) examiner</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> will not normally give out personal information for your insurance. In rare situations, on the day of the test the examiner will:</p>

<ul>
<li>give you their full name</li>
  <li>confirm they are over 25 years old</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> isn’t responsible for risks that aren’t covered by insurance, eg the loss of any no claims bonus.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="how-the-test-works"><header><h1>Part 4: How the test works</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll have to give practical instruction to the examiner while they play 2 of the following roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>a beginner or partly trained pupil</li>
  <li>a pupil who is about test standard</li>
  <li>a qualified driver taking driver development training</li>
</ul>
<p>The examiner will stay in character as the ‘pupil’ when the test starts. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The examiner will come out of character to help make instructions clearer and for road safety reasons.</p>
</div>

<h2>Exercises you could cover</h2>

<p>You’ll cover 2 exercises - 1 for each of the roles the examiner plays. The examiner will choose the exercises from the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>safety precautions on entering the car and explanation of the controls</li>
  <li>moving off and making normal stops</li>
  <li>reversing the car and entering limited openings to the right or left</li>
  <li>turning the vehicle round in the road to face the opposite direction</li>
  <li>parking close to the kerb, using reverse gears</li>
  <li>practical instruction in how to use mirrors and make an emergency stop</li>
  <li>approaching and turning corners</li>
  <li>judgement of speed and general road positioning</li>
  <li>dealing with emerging at T-junctions</li>
  <li>dealing with all aspects of crossroads</li>
  <li>dealing with pedestrian crossings and giving appropriate signals</li>
  <li>meeting, crossing the path of and overtaking other vehicles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your instruction</h2>

<p>Your instruction should be tailored to the standard of the ‘pupil’ the examiner is playing and to the time available - about 30 minutes for each part.</p>

<p>You’re allowed to: </p>

<ul>
<li>ask the ‘pupil’ questions to find out more about their knowledge</li>
  <li>use lesson plans and training aids</li>
  <li>refer to notes or subject headings - but you can’t read at length from notes or books</li>
</ul>
<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep any briefing or stationary instruction short</li>
  <li>be prepared for the ‘pupil’ to ask questions</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must give the ‘pupil’ a chance to show you what you’ve taught them. You should correct any faults they make.</p>
</div>

<h2>The examiner’s supervisor</h2>

<p>A supervising officer may also sit in on the test. They are there to check the examiner - not you. They won’t have any say in how your test is carried out, or in the result.</p>

</article><article id="how-youre-assessed-in-the-test"><header><h1>Part 5: How you're assessed in the test</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll be assessed on 3 main areas during your approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>) part 3 test:</p>

<ul>
<li>core competencies</li>
  <li>instructional techniques</li>
  <li>instructor characteristics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core competencies</h2>

<p>The examiner will assess how well you:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify and prioritise faults</li>
  <li>analyse and explain faults</li>

  <li>control the lesson</li>
  <li>communicate with the ‘pupil’</li>
  <li>use question and answer techniques</li>
  <li>give feedback and encourage the ‘pupil’</li>
</ul>
<p>The examiner will also assess when and why you use the dual controls. </p>

<h2>Instructor characteristics</h2>

<p>The examiner will assess whether you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a relaxed and friendly manner, but aren’t over familiar</li>
  <li>appear confident, and are able to fill your ‘pupil’ with confidence in a patient and tactful way</li>
</ul>
