<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not following the code isn’t illegal. However, if someone wins an employment tribunal against you and you didn’t follow the code, then their award could be up to 25% more.</p>
</div>

<p>The exact rules will depend on your organisation, but could cover things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>acceptable and unacceptable behaviour</li>
  <li>absence and timekeeping</li>
  <li>health and safety</li>
  <li>use of phones and the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t normally discipline or dismiss an employee for <a href="/dismissing-staff/whistleblowing" title="whistleblowing">whistleblowing</a>.</p>

<h2>Gross misconduct</h2>

<p>Your disciplinary rules should give examples of what will be treated as <strong>gross misconduct</strong>. This is misconduct judged so serious that it’s likely to lead to dismissal without notice, eg fraud, theft and physical violence.</p>

<h2>Telling employees about disciplinary rules</h2>

<p>Your disciplinary rules must be in your <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="statement of employment">statement of employment</a> or clearly written elsewhere, eg in a staff handbook.</p>

<p>The rules should clearly say when someone might face disciplinary action and what that action could be.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> also give the name of someone they should appeal to if they’re unhappy about a disciplinary decision.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you don’t provide this information and an employee then wins an employment tribunal claim against you, they could be awarded 2 to 4 weeks’ pay.</p>
</div>

<h2>Disciplinary procedures and contracts</h2>

<p>If you make your disciplinary procedures part of an employment contract then the employee could make a breach of contract claim against you if you don’t follow your procedures.</p>

<h2>Example letters and forms</h2>

<p><abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> has a number of <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1439" title="sample letters and forms for disciplinary proceedings">sample letters and forms for disciplinary proceedings</a> on its website.</p>


</article><article id="disciplinary-investigations-and-hearings"><header><h1>Part 3: Disciplinary investigations and hearings</h1>
  </header><p>The law doesn’t say exactly how you should investigate disciplinary issues or hold disciplinary meetings.</p>

<p>However, the Acas guide to discipline and grievances at work has lots of practical advice about running disciplinary proceedings professionally and fairly.</p>

</div>

<h2>The suggested disciplinary process</h2>

<p>The Acas guidance suggests that your disciplinary process should follow the following format:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>A letter telling your employer the issue and inviting them to a disciplinary hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meeting with your employee to discuss the issue - they should have the right to be accompanied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A letter to your employee saying what action you are going to take. This should be sent as soon as practically possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your employee should than have a chance to <a href="/taking-disciplinary-action/appeals" title="appeal your decision">appeal your decision</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Disciplinary decisions</h2>

<p>Disciplinary decisions could be anything that could resolve the problem.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>no action</li>
  <li>written warning</li>
  <li>final warning</li>
  <li>demotion</li>
  <li>dismissal</li>
  <li>mediation with a co-worker</li>
</ul></article><article id="appeals"><header><h1>Part 4: Appeals</h1>
  </header><p>An employee has the right to appeal against a decision made after a disciplinary hearing.</p>

<p>You should tell them about this when you give them written notice of your decision, and should give them a deadline to tell you they want to appeal.</p>

<p>Your employee’s statement of terms and conditions of employment must legally include the person they can apply to if they want to appeal a disciplinary decision. It must also explain how to do this.</p>

<p>If the employee does decide to appeal, you should try to hold the appeal hearing as soon as possible.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should follow the Acas code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures’ when dealing with appeals. Otherwise, if someone wins an employment tribunal against you their award could be higher.</p>
