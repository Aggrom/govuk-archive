</header><article id="taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal"><header><h1>Part 1: Taking a case to an employment tribunal</h1>
  </header><p>You can take your employer to an employment tribunal if you think they’ve treated you unfairly, or broken the law.</p>

<p>The tribunal is independent, and could order the employer to pay you compensation if you win your case.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You usually have to apply to the tribunal within 3 months of your employment ending, or the problem happening at work.</p>
</div>

<h2>What cases the tribunal can deal with</h2>

<p>The tribunal can deal with a wide range of claims, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>unfair dismissal</li>
  <li>discrimination</li>
  <li>unfair deductions from your pay</li>
</ul>
<h2>Before you go to the tribunal</h2>

<p>Before you go the tribunal, see if there is another way to solve the problem - eg using a grievance procedure.</p>

<p>Phone <abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) for help and advice on how to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>If you’re in Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>If you live in Northern Ireland, you need to appeal to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.employmenttribunalsni.co.uk/" title="Office of Industrial Tribunals and the Fair Employment Tribunal">Office of Industrial Tribunals and the Fair Employment Tribunal.</a></p>


</article><article id="after-you-send-your-claim"><header><h1>Part 2: After you send your claim</h1>
  </header><p>Someone from Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) may contact you to see if you can solve the problem without going to a tribunal.</p>

<p>This is a free service and anything you say to Acas will be confidential.</p>

<h2>If the employer doesn’t respond to your claim</h2>

<p>The employer usually has to respond to your claim, to give their side of the case, within 28 days of getting your claim form.</p>

<p>If they don’t reply, an employment judge may decide on your case without you having to go to a hearing.</p>

<h2>If the employer responds to your claim</h2>

<p>If your employer does respond, there will be a hearing to decide on your case.</p>

<p>You may be asked to go to a meeting with the judge to decide on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the date and time of the hearing</li>
  <li>how long the hearing should take</li>
  <li>other issues about your case</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting ready for a hearing</h2>

<p>Contact the tribunal office if you have any problems, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>getting information from the employer</li>
  <li>asking a witness to come to your hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get a letter giving you details of the hearing, where the tribunal will make a final decision - or ‘judgment’ - on your case.</p>

</article><article id="going-to-a-tribunal-hearing"><header><h1>Part 3: Going to a tribunal hearing</h1>
  </header><p>When you go to the tribunal hearing, take the documents you’re using to support your case.</p>

<p>You can take a colleague with you if you want, but they can’t speak for you or ask questions. You are both entitled to paid time off work for this.</p>

<p>Cases are normally held in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/employment/venues" title="employment tribunal office">employment tribunal office</a> closest to place where you worked.</p>

<h2>What happens at the hearing</h2>

<p>You (or your representative) and the employer put your cases to a panel or a judge, and answer questions.</p>

<p>You will normally give evidence first, unless your case is about unfair dismissal.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You normally get the tribunal’s decision - or ‘judgment’ - on the day, but it may be sent in the post a few days after the hearing.</p>
</div>

<p>You can’t claim for expenses for going to the hearing.</p>


</article><article id="if-you-win-your-case"><header><h1>Part 4: If you win your case</h1>
  </header><p>If you win your case, the tribunal can order your employer to:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay you compensation</li>
  <li>improve your working conditions</li>
  <li>give you your job back, if appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are given compensation the amount you get depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of case</li>
  <li>your age, length of service, and salary</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually there are set limits to the amount you can get. However, in cases of discrimination, there is no limit.</p>

<p>If your employer is ordered to re-employ you and doesn’t, or fails to obey any other order, the tribunal can force them to pay you extra compensation.</p>

<h2>If your employer doesn’t pay</h2>

<p>If you don’t get your payment, first contact your employer to find out why. </p>

<p>If they still don’t pay, you can force them to.</p>

<p>You may not be able to do this if the employer has, or is about to, appeal.</p>

<h3>If you’re in England or Wales</h3>

<p>Ask the local county court to send an enforcement officer to get the money from your employer. This costs £40.</p>

<p>To do this, fill in an <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=552" title="N322A - Application to enforce an award form">application to enforce an award</a> form, using the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2363" title="guidance for completing form N322A">guidance notes</a> to help you.</p>

<p>Send this, with copy of the tribunal’s decision, to your <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/" title="Find your local court">local county court.</a></p>

<p>You can also use the Fast Track scheme to send a High Court Enforcement Officer - similar to a bailiff - to demand payment from your employer.</p>

<p>This costs £60, which you get back from the employer when they pay.</p>

<p>To use this service, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=2393" title="Employment Tribunal Fast Track Enforcement Form">Employment Tribunal Fast Track Enforcement form.</a></p>

<p>Send it to the address on the form.</p>

<h3>If you’re in Scotland</h3>

<p>Write to the office that heard from your case, asking for an ‘extract of the judgement’. A Sheriff Officer can use this to force the employer to pay.</p>

<h2>Redundancy payments</h2>

<p>If you’re due a redundancy payment and your employer hasn’t paid it, call the Redundancy Payments Helpline.</p>

<div class="contact">

  </header><p>If you lose your case, you may be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask the tribunal to look at the case again</li>
  <li>appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask the tribunal to review the decision or judgment</h2>

<p>You need to write to the tribunal office within 14 days of getting the decision, saying why you want it to be reviewed.</p>

<p>You also need to give good reasons for asking for a review, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tribunal made a mistake in the way it reached its decision</li>
  <li>you weren’t told about the hearing, or weren’t at the hearing</li>
  <li>new evidence has turned up since the hearing</li>
</ul>
<p>Send the form to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/employment/venues" title="tribunal office">tribunal office.</a></p>

<h2>Appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal</h2>

<p>You can also appeal if you think the tribunal made a legal mistake.</p>

<p>To do this, fill in a notice of appeal form:</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/global/forms/tribunals/emp-appeals/Form1NoticeOfAppeal.pdf" title="Download 'Notice of appeal form' (PDF, 80KB)">Download ‘Notice of appeal form’ (PDF, 80KB)</a></p>
</div>

<p>Say why you think the decision was legally wrong or unreasonable.</p>

<p>Send the form to the appropriate address below, along with copies of:</p>

<ul>
<li>your original claim form</li>
  <li>the employer’s response</li>
  <li>the tribunal’s decision, and the written reasons for it</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask the tribunal to send you written reasons, if you don’t already have them.</p>

<p>You usually need to apply within 42 days of receiving the decision or the written reasons.</p>
