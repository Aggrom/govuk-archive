  </header><h2>School behaviour policy</h2>

<p>Every school has a behaviour policy, which lists the rules of conduct for pupils before and after school as well as during the school day. </p>

<p>The policy should also say what the school does to prevent bullying. </p>

<p>You can ask the school for a copy of the policy document.</p>

<h2>Punishments</h2>

<p>Schools can punish pupils if they behave badly. </p>

<p>Examples of punishments (sometimes called ‘sanctions’) include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a telling-off</li>
  <li>a letter home</li>
  <li>removal from a class or group</li>
  <li>confiscating something inappropriate for school (eg mobile phone or MP3 player)</li>
  <li>detention</li>
</ul>
<h3>Detention</h3>

<p>Schools don’t have to give parents notice of after school detentions or tell them why a detention has been given</p>

<h3>Physical contact</h3>

<p>School staff can use reasonable force to control and restrain pupils. This could include leading a pupil by the arm into a classroom. </p>

<h3>Complaining about a punishment</h3>

<p>If you disagree with the way your child’s been punished, first talk to the head teacher. If you’re not satisfied, ask for a copy of the complaints procedure.</p>


</article><article id="exclusions"><header><h1>Part 2: Exclusions</h1>
  </header><p>Headteachers can exclude your child (also called being ‘expelled’ or ‘suspended’) if they misbehave.</p>

<h2>What happens when your child is excluded</h2>

<p>Your child’s school will let you know about an exclusion as soon as possible and follow up with a letter including information about how long your child is excluded for and why.</p>

<p>You should also be told how to challenge the exclusion, if you want to. </p>

<p>Exclusions can start the same day but the school can’t make you collect your child straight away.</p>

<h3>Risk of prosecution if child is found in public place</h3>

<p>For the first 5 school days of an exclusion, it’s your responsibility to make sure your child isn’t in a public place during normal school hours unless there is a good reason.</p>

<p>If your child is found in a public place when they’re not supposed to be, <a href="/school-attendance-absence" title="School attendance and absence">you might be prosecuted</a>.</p>

<h2>Types of exclusion</h2>

<p>There are 2 kinds of exclusion - fixed period (suspended) and permanent (expelled).</p>

<h3>Fixed period exclusion</h3>

<p>A fixed period exclusion is where your child is temporarily removed from school. They can only be removed for up to 45 school days in 1 school year. </p>

<p>If a child has been excluded for a fixed period, schools should set and mark work for the first 5 school days.</p>

<p>If the exclusion is longer than 5 school days, the school must arrange full-time education from the 6th school day.</p>

<h3>Permanent exclusion</h3>

<p>Permanent exclusion means your child is expelled. The local council must arrange full-time education from the 6th school day. </p>

<h3>Alternative education and exclusion</h3>

<p>The school must tell you about any arrangements that have been made for your child to attend alternative education. If alternative education is arranged then it’s your responsibility to make sure your child attends.</p>

<h2>Challenging exclusion</h2>

<p>The letter from school about the exclusion will tell you how to challenge the decision. </p>

<h3>Challenging fixed period exclusion</h3>

<p>You can challenge fixed period exclusions if a pupil has been excluded for more than 5 school days in a term and an exclusion will mean they will miss a public exam or national curriculum test. For exclusions of 5 school days or less, parents can ask the governing body to consider their views.</p>

<h3>Challenging permanent exclusion</h3>

<p>You can challenge permanent exclusion with the governing body. If they agree with the exclusion, you can appeal to the local council or the Academy Trust if the school is an <a href="/types-of-school/academies" title="Academies">academy</a>. The governing body must tell you how to do this.</p>

</article><article id="searches"><header><h1>Part 3: Searches</h1>
  </header><h2>Searches without your child’s consent</h2>

<p>The school doesn’t need your child’s consent to search them if they think your child has prohibited items:</p>

<ul>
<li>weapons, eg knives</li>
  <li>alcohol</li>
  <li>illegal drugs</li>
  <li>stolen goods</li>
  <li>tobacco products, eg cigarettes</li>
  <li>pornographic images (of any kind, eg tabloid topless pictures and ‘lads’ mags’ as well as extreme adult material)</li>
  <li>fireworks</li>
  <li>anything that has been, or is likely to be, used to cause injury or commit an offence</li>
  <li>anything banned in the school rules</li>
</ul>
<p>These things can be confiscated. </p>

<h2>Legal requirements of a search</h2>

<p>There should normally be 2 members of staff present during the search - the person doing the search and the search witness. Searches should normally be done by someone the same sex as your child.</p>

<p>The search witness must also be the same sex as your child if possible. Your child must not be asked to remove clothes, other than outer clothing like a coat.</p>

<p>If there’s a risk of serious harm to a person if the search is not conducted immediately, a child may be searched by a person of the opposite sex and without another member of staff present.</p>

<h2>Metal detectors</h2>

<p>Schools can make pupils go through a metal detector - they don’t have to suspect that your child has a weapon. If your child refuses to go through the metal detector, they can be stopped from coming into school.</p>

<h2>Complaining about a search</h2>

<p>If you’re unhappy with a search on your child at school, talk to the headteacher. If you’re not satisfied, ask for a copy of the complaints procedure.</p>
