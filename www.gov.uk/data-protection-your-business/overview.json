eg lock paper records in filing cabinets or set passwords for computer records.\r\n\r\nOnly keep the information for as long as you have a clear business need for it, and dispose of it securely afterwards (eg by shredding).\r\n\r\n##Recruiting staff\r\n\r\nYou must give the name of your business and contact details (or those of the agency) on job adverts.\r\n\r\nOnly collect the personal information you need on application forms, and don't ask for irrelevant information, like banking details.\r\n\r\n$E **Example**  \r\nYou will usually only have to ask about motoring offences if driving is part of the job.\r\n$E\r\n\r\nOnly keep the information for recruitment - eg don't use it for a marketing mailing list.\r\n\r\n##Keeping staff records\r\n\r\nMake sure only appropriate staff, with the right training, can see staff records, and store sensitive information (eg about health or criminal records) separately.\r\n\r\n$E **Example**  \r\nDon't let managers access a worker's sickness record if they only need to see a simple record of their absences.  \r\n$E\r\n\r\nIf you're asked to provide a reference, check the worker or ex-staff member is happy for you to do so.\r\n\r\n##Letting staff see their records\r\n\r\nYour staff have the right to ask for a copy of the [information you hold about them](/personal-data-my-employer-can-keep-about-me \"information you hold about them\").\r\n\r\nThis includes information about grievance and disciplinary issues.\r\n\r\nYou must respond to their request within 40 days.\r\n\r\n^You can turn down their request if the information concerns someone else - eg you need to protect someone who's accused them of harassment.^\r\n\r\nStaff can complain if they think their information is being misused, and you could be ordered to pay a fine or compensation.\r\n\r\n","slug":"recruitment-managing-staff-records","title":"Recruitment and managing staff records"}},{"table":{"body":"You must be able to justify monitoring staff at work, which could include:\r\n\r\n- using [CCTV](/data-protection-your-business/using-cctv \"using CCTV\")\r\n- keeping records of phone calls\r\n- logging their email or internet use\r\n- searching staff or their work areas\r\n\r\nEmployees have rights at work and if you don't treat them fairly they could:\r\n\r\n- take you to an employment tribunal\r\n- complain to the Information Commissioner \r\n\r\nYou must make them aware that they\u2019re being monitored, and why -
