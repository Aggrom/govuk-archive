  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You must follow rules on data protection if your business stores or uses personal information.</p>

<p>This applies to information kept on staff, customers and account holders, eg when you:</p>

<ul>
<li>recruit staff</li>
  <li>manage staff records</li>
  <li>market your products or services</li>
  <li>use CCTV</li>
</ul>
<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping customers’ addresses on file</li>
  <li>recording staff working hours</li>
  <li>giving delivery information to a delivery company</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>For information on direct marketing, see <a href="/marketing-advertising-law/direct-marketing" title="marketing and advertising: the law">marketing and advertising: the law</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Data protection rules</h2>

<p>You must make sure the information is kept secure, accurate and up to date.</p>

<p>For example, when you collect someone’s personal data you must tell them:</p>

<ul>
<li>who you are</li>
  <li>how you’ll use their personal information</li>
  <li>they have the right to see the information and correct it, if it’s wrong</li>
</ul>
<p>Also say if the information will be used in other ways - eg if it may be passed to other organisations.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The main data protection rules are set out in the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/the_principles.aspx" title="data protection principles" rel="external">data protection principles.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>What you have to do</h2>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/data-protection-register-notify-ico-personal-data" title="tell the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)">tell the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner's Office">ICO</abbr>)</a> how your business uses personal information</li>
  <li>
<a href="/respond-data-protection-request" title="respond to a data protection request">respond to a data protection request</a>, if someone asks to see what information you have about them</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you misuse personal data, you could be given a heavy fine, or made to pay compensation.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="recruitment-managing-staff-records"><header><h1>Part 2: Recruitment and managing staff records</h1>
  </header><p>You must keep any data you collect on staff secure - eg lock paper records in filing cabinets or set passwords for computer records.</p>

<p>Only keep the information for as long as you have a clear business need for it, and dispose of it securely afterwards (eg by shredding).</p>

<h2>Recruiting staff</h2>

<p>You must give the name of your business and contact details (or those of the agency) on job adverts.</p>

<p>Only collect the personal information you need on application forms, and don’t ask for irrelevant information, like banking details.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
You will usually only have to ask about motoring offences if driving is part of the job.</p>
</div>

<p>Only keep the information for recruitment - eg don’t use it for a marketing mailing list.</p>

<h2>Keeping staff records</h2>

<p>Make sure only appropriate staff, with the right training, can see staff records, and store sensitive information (eg about health or criminal records) separately.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Don’t let managers access a worker’s sickness record if they only need to see a simple record of their absences.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re asked to provide a reference, check the worker or ex-staff member is happy for you to do so.</p>

<h2>Letting staff see their records</h2>

<p>Your staff have the right to ask for a copy of the <a href="/personal-data-my-employer-can-keep-about-me" title="information you hold about them">information you hold about them</a>.</p>

<p>This includes information about grievance and disciplinary issues.</p>

<p>You must respond to their request within 40 days.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can turn down their request if the information concerns someone else - eg you need to protect someone who’s accused them of harassment.</p>
</div>

<p>Staff can complain if they think their information is being misused, and you could be ordered to pay a fine or compensation.</p>


</article><article id="monitoring-staff-at-work"><header><h1>Part 3: Monitoring staff at work</h1>
  </header><p>You must be able to justify monitoring staff at work, which could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>using <a href="/data-protection-your-business/using-cctv" title="using CCTV">CCTV</a>
</li>
  <li>keeping records of phone calls</li>
  <li>logging their email or internet use</li>
  <li>searching staff or their work areas</li>
</ul>
<p>Employees have rights at work and if you don’t treat them fairly they could:</p>

<ul>
<li>take you to an employment tribunal</li>
  <li>complain to the Information Commissioner </li>
</ul>
<p>You must make them aware that they’re being monitored, and why - eg by sending them an email.</p>

<p>Also explain your policies on things like using work computers or phones for personal use.</p>

<h2>Monitoring staff without their knowledge</h2>

<p>You can monitor staff without their knowledge if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you suspect they’re breaking the law</li>
  <li>letting them know about it would make it hard to detect the crime</li>
</ul>
<p>Only do this as part of a specific investigation, and stop when the investigation is over.</p>

</article><article id="using-cctv"><header><h1>Part 4: Using CCTV</h1>
  </header><p>If your business uses CCTV, you must tell people they may be recorded.</p>

<p>This is usually done by displaying signs, which must be clearly visible and readable.</p>

<p>You must also <a href="/data-protection-register-notify-ico-personal-data" title="notify the Information Commissioner's Office">notify the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner's Office">ICO</abbr>)</a> why you’re using the CCTV.</p>

<p>You should control who can see the recordings, and make sure the system is only used for the purpose it was intended for.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If the system was set up to detect crime, you should not use it to monitor the amount of work done by your staff.</p>
</div>

<h2>Letting people see CCTV recordings</h2>

<p>Anyone can ask to see images that you’ve recorded of them. You must provide these within 40 days, and can charge up to £10.</p>

<p>Find out more about using CCTV on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/topic_guides/cctv.aspx" title="Information Commissioner's Office website"><abbr title="Information Commissioner's Office">ICO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Data protection rules don’t apply if you install a camera on your own home to protect it from burglary.</p>
