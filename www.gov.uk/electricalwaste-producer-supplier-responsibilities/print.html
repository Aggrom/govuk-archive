  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>There are rules on how to deal with most waste electrical or electronic equipment (<abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>). These rules are known as the <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> regulations and will apply to your business if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>sell electrical and electronic equipment </li>
  <li>generate <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>produce electrical or electronic equipment </li>
  <li>manufacture or rebrand electrical or electronic equipment</li>
  <li>import or export electrical and electronic equipment within the EU</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules apply to most electrical and electronic equipment, there are very few <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32108.aspx" title="WEEE exemptions">exemptions.</a></p>


</article><article id="suppliers"><header><h1>Part 2: Suppliers</h1>
  </header><p>You’re a supplier (or ‘distributor’) if you sell products, even if you sell them via distance selling (eg, by telephone, internet). </p>

<h2>Collection schemes</h2>

<p>Customers can return their waste electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>) to you, this is known as ‘takeback’. There are 3 ways to provide a takeback service: </p>

<ul>
<li>offer an in-store service - eg, customers can come to your shop and give you their <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>join the <a rel="external" href="http://dts.valpak.co.uk/dts" title="Join a Distributor Takeback Scheme">Distributor Takeback Scheme</a> - you can then tell customers where their nearest <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> recycling facility is</li>
  <li>set up your own takeback scheme - this must be free and accessible </li>
</ul>
<p>If the customer is buying a similar item from you, they can also return their old item to you. Contact the producer to dispose of this <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>.  </p>

<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>You can charge businesses for taking back their <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>. You can’t charge members of the public. You can charge to collect <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> (eg, from a house) but the fee can only cover the actual cost of collection. </p>

<h2>Provide information</h2>

<p>You must give customers free written information on: </p>

<ul>
<li>how they can safely dispose of their <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the benefits of the takeback scheme </li>
  <li>the environmental impacts of electrical / electronic products</li>
  <li>why they must separate <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> from other waste</li>
  <li>explain the <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> labelling on the product </li>
</ul>
<p>You can do this using posters or a website.</p>

<h2>Keep records</h2>

<p>You must keep records about:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> you collect - these must be kept for 4 years</li>
  <li>how you tell customers about <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</li>
</ul></article><article id="producers"><header><h1>Part 3: Producers</h1>
  </header><p>You’re a producer if you manufacture, import, export or rebrand electrical or electronic equipment.  </p>

<h2>Recycling schemes</h2>
<p>You’re responsible for the collection, treatment, recovery and disposal of your market share of waste electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>). You can meet these responsibilities in 2 ways: </p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32086.aspx" title="Join a Producer Compliance Scheme">join a Producer Compliance Scheme</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32104.aspx" title="Set up your own producer compliance scheme">set up your own scheme</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Keep records</h2>
<p>You must keep records showing how much electrical and electronic equipment you produce and sell within the EU. Keep these records for 4 years.   </p>

<h2>Manufacturing responsibilities</h2>
<p>If you manufacture electrical or electronic equipment there are <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32106.aspx" title="WEEE rules for manufacturers">extra <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> rules</a> you must follow including: </p>

<ul>
