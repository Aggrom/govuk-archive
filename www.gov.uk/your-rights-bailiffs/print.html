</header><article id="what-you-can-do-when-a-bailiff-visits"><header><h1>Part 1: What you can do when a bailiff visits</h1>
  </header><p>A bailiff may visit your home if you don’t pay your debts - eg a Council Tax bill, parking fine, court fine or county court judgment.</p>

<p>This will happen if you ignore reminder and warning letters, saying that bailiffs will be used.</p>

<p>You can stop bailiffs from visiting by paying the money you owe.</p>

<h2>Dealing with bailiffs</h2>

<p>In most cases, you don’t have to open your front door to a bailiff or let them in.</p>

<p>Bailiffs are not usually allowed to force their way into your home - eg by pushing past you, or putting their foot in the door.</p>

<p>However, if you don’t let them in or agree to pay them:</p>

<ul>
<li>they can charge you more fees</li>
  <li>you could end up owing even more money</li>
  <li>they could take things from outside your home - eg your car</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do let them in, but don’t pay them, they may take some of your belongings. They could sell the items to pay the debt and cover their fees.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Bailiffs <strong>are</strong> allowed to force their way into your home to collect unpaid criminal fines, Income Tax or VAT, but only as a last resort.</p>
</div>

<h2>What to ask a bailiff</h2>

<p>Before you pay a bailiff, or let them in to take your things, ask to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>proof of their identity - eg a badge or ID card</li>
  <li>a detailed breakdown of their charges</li>
</ul>
<h2>Paying a bailiff</h2>

<p>You can pay the bailiff on the doorstep - you don’t have to invite them into your home.</p>

<p>Make sure you get a receipt, to prove you’ve paid.</p>

<p>If you can’t pay all the money right away, speak to the bailiff about how you could pay the money back.</p>

<p>Offer to pay what you can realistically afford in weekly or monthly payments.</p>

<p>The bailiff does not have to accept your offer.</p>

<h2>What bailiffs can and can’t take</h2>

<p>If you let a bailiff into your home, they may take some of your belongings to sell.</p>

<p>Bailiffs can take luxury items - eg a TV or games console.</p>

<p>They can’t take:</p>

<ul>
<li>things you need - eg your clothes, cooker, fridge, furniture or work tools</li>
  <li>someone else’s belongings - eg your partner’s computer</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have to prove that someone else’s goods don’t belong to you.</p>

<h2>What bailiffs can charge</h2>

<p>Bailiffs will charge you for visits to your home - this will be added to what you owe.</p>

<p>They can also charge you fees for coming into your home and taking your belongings.</p>

<p>You can challenge them and complain if you think they’re charging too much, or for something they haven’t done.</p>

</article><article id="how-to-complain-about-a-bailiff"><header><h1>Part 2: How to complain about a bailiff</h1>
  </header><p>You can complain about a bailiff if you think they’ve broken the rules, eg if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>threaten or harass you</li>
  <li>try to break into your home</li>
  <li>try to charge you incorrect fees</li>
  <li>take goods belonging to someone else</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to complain to different people, depending on whether the bailiff is a:</p>

<ul>
<li>private bailiff, working for a private company</li>
  <li>county court bailiff or civilian enforcement officer, working directly for the court</li>
</ul>
<h2>Complain about a private bailiff</h2>

<p>Most bailiffs work for private companies, even if they’re collecting money for the council or the government.</p>

<p>To complain about a private bailiff, write to the bailiff’s company.</p>

<p>If you don’t get a response from the company, write to the organisation you owe the money to - eg the council.</p>

<p>Keep a copy of your complaint letter.</p>

<h2>Complain to a trade organisation</h2>

<p>You may also be able to complain to the bailiff’s trade association.</p>

<p>Check the membership lists on the trade associations’ websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.civea.co.uk/member-list.htm" title="Civil Enforcement Association - member list">Civil Enforcement Association - member list</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.hceoa.org.uk/members/authorised-members-directory.html" title="High Court Enforcement Officers Association - directory">High Court Enforcement Officers Association - directory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the bailiff is a member, write to the trade association to complain. Follow the complaints procedure on the association’s website.</p>

<h2>Complain about a county court bailiff or civilian enforcement officer</h2>

<p>To complain about a county court bailiff or civilian enforcement officer, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetLeaflet.do?court_leaflets_id=254" title="court complaint form">court complaint form.</a></p>
