<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you or your business use agricultural vehicles, they may require a different licence and may even be exempt from vehicle tax. Vehicle driving licences are categorised by type of vehicle and also vary according to the weight of the vehicle. However, most agricultural tractors mounted on wheels can be driven on the public highway by anyone who has passed a car driving test.</p>

<p>This guide provides information on the licensing requirements for agricultural vehicles and explains which vehicles are exempt from tax. It also explains the different legal requirements - including the minimum age requirement for driving agricultural vehicles and type approval for tractors. Finally, there are details on quad bikes, rebated fuel and agricultural vehicles that are exempt from an operator’s licence.</p>

<h2 id="licensing-requirements-for-farm-vehicles">Licensing requirements for farm vehicles</h2>

<p>Under special licensing arrangements, you are allowed to drive larger vehicles on your farm without holding a large goods vehicle (<abbr title="large goods vehicle">LGV</abbr>) driving licence entitlement.</p>

<p>If you drive a larger vehicle, the maximum authorised mass - ie the total weight of the vehicle plus the maximum load it can carry - will determine which driving licence entitlement you require, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>3.5 to 7.5 tonnes requires a category C1 licence</li>
  <li>more than 7.5 tonnes requires a category C licence</li>
</ul>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age to drive a vehicle weighing between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes, and 21 years of age to drive a vehicle over 7.5 tonnes.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-ages-to-drive-agricultural-vehicles">Minimum ages to drive agricultural vehicles</h2>

<p>There are age restrictions that control the type of vehicle you can legally drive. The tables below provide information on the licence required to drive or ride agricultural vehicles and the minimum age requirements.</p>

<p>*Age 17 if you are a member of the armed services</p>

<p>**Age 18 if you got your driving licence before 10 September 2009, and the weight of the vehicle and trailer together is under 7,500 kilograms</p>

<p>Though the minimum age is 21, you can drive C1+E category vehicles at age 18 if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have passed your driving test and Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (<abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>) initial qualification</li>
  <li>are learning to drive or taking a driving test for this category or Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> initial qualification</li>

  <li>had your driving licence before 10 September 2009 - you must take the <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> periodic training within five years of this date</li>
</ul>
<p>A C1+E category vehicle is the same as a C1 vehicle, except with a trailer over 750 kilograms. For example, a vehicle with an unladen weight of 6,000 kilograms and a maximum weight of 7,500 kilograms pulling a fully loaded trailer with a weight of 4,500 kilograms gives a total weight 12,000 kilograms.</p>

<h3 id="exempted-large-goods-vehicles">Exempted large goods vehicles</h3>

<p>If you hold a full category B (car) driving licence you can drive a number of large agricultural vehicles: </p>

<ul>
<li>goods vehicles propelled by steam eg large vehicles with coal or wood burning engines</li>
  <li>works trucks (primarily designed for use in private premises or in the immediate vicinity eg dumper trucks/forklift trucks)</li>
  <li>industrial tractors (tractors used mainly for haulage work off the public road, the vehicle must not have an unladen weight exceeding 7370kgs and have a design speed not exceeding 20mph)</li>
  <li>agricultural motor vehicles which are not agricultural or forestry tractors (primarily used off the public road eg crop sprayer/combine harvester)</li>
  <li>digging machines (vehicles which are limited to travel on public roads only for the purpose of proceeding to/from sites - used for trench digging or any kind of excavating or shovelling work eg vehicles with digging buckets/shovels)</li>
  <li>
    <p>goods vehicle which is not used on public roads or, if it is so used during any calendar week:
    - is used only in passing from land in the occupation of a person keeping the vehicle to other land in the occupation of that person
    - is not used on public roads for distances exceeding an aggregate of 9.7 kilometres in that calendar week</p>
  </li>
  <li>goods vehicles, other than an agricultural motor vehicle, used only for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry:
    - is used on roads only in passing between different areas of land occupied by the same person
    - in passing between any two such areas does not travel a distance exceeding 1.5 kilometres on roads</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-cranes">Mobile cranes</h3>

<p>You now require a category C1 driving licence to drive a mobile crane weighing between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes. If the weight of the crane is over 7.5 tonnes then you will require a category C licence.</p>

<h3 id="abandoned-and-nuisance-vehicles">Abandoned and nuisance vehicles</h3>

<p>Abandoned vehicles can cause a nuisance, attract anti-social behaviour, or be part of a criminal investigation. Abandoning a vehicle is a crime and can attract a financial penalty or prison sentence.</p>

<p>If you believe a vehicle may have been abandoned on or near your property, you should try to confirm whether the vehicle has been abandoned. You can do this by checking:</p>

<ul>
<li>the vehicle’s tax disc - to see whether it has expired</li>
  <li>the general state of the car - eg flat tyres, a broken windscreen, or removed parts may suggest that it has been abandoned</li>
  <li>whether the vehicle has a number plate</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are sure that the vehicle has been abandoned, you should report it to your local council. You should provide the council with any information you know about the vehicle, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>vehicle, make, model and colour</li>
  <li>vehicle registration number - which should also be on the tax disc</li>
  <li>condition of the vehicle - and any damage to it</li>
  <li>expiry date on the tax disc - if there is one</li>
  <li>location of the vehicle - and if it is causing an obstruction</li>
  <li>how long the vehicle has been abandoned</li>
  <li>any additional information - eg who was the last person you saw in the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vehicle-tax-exemptions">Vehicle tax exemptions</h2>

<p>There are certain types of vehicle that are exempt from vehicle tax. If your vehicle is exempt, you will still need to display a valid tax disc. You will be issued a free tax disc when taxing your vehicle and will need to renew it each year.</p>

<h3 id="vehicles-exempt-from-tax">Vehicles exempt from tax</h3>

<p>If you own a vehicle that is used solely for the purpose of agriculture, horticulture or forestry, it is exempt from vehicle tax. </p>

<p>You can <a href="/vehicle-exempt-from-car-tax">check which agricultural, horticultural and forestry and other vehicles are exempt from vehicle tax.</a></p>

<p>If you don’t need to pay vehicle tax, you still need to <a href="/car-tax-disc-vehicle-licence">apply for a tax disc</a> and display the ‘nil value disc’ on your vehicle.</p>

<p>All vehicles supplied for use in the UK need to meet strict health and safety standards.</p>

<p>Vehicle Type Approval is the confirmation that production samples of a design will meet specified performance standards. The specification of the product is recorded and only that specification is approved.</p>

<h2 id="agricultural-quad-bikes">Agricultural quad bikes</h2>

<p>An agricultural quadricycle (quad) is a light four-wheeled vehicle intended for off-road use. It must be registered with the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licence Agency">DVLA</abbr> as an agricultural vehicle and be used as a working vehicle for farming, forestry or similar purposes.</p>

<p>You are allowed to use an agricultural quad on the public road for short distances as long as it is registered for road use, has a number plate and complies with the relevant lighting and construction requirements.</p>

<h3 id="lighting-requirements">Lighting requirements</h3>

<p>If you use an agricultural quad on the public road between sunrise and sunset you are not required to fit a lamp or reflector. However, you will be required to make hand signals to indicate slowing down or change of direction.</p>

<p>To use your agricultural quad during the night it must be fitted with the full complement of lighting, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>lamps</li>
  <li>reflectors</li>
  <li>rear markings and other devices</li>
</ul>
<p>If your quad was first used on or after 1 April 1986, the types of lamp it requires are determined by the maximum speed of the vehicle, as shown in the table below:</p>

<h3 id="lamp-requirements-for-different-types-of-quad">Lamp requirements for different types of quad</h3>

<h3 id="additional-features-and-rules-for-agricultural-quads">Additional features and rules for agricultural quads</h3>

<p>If your agricultural quad is capable of speeds exceeding 20mph then you are required to fit a speedometer and a horn.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to carry any passengers on an agricultural quad.</p>

<h2 id="rebated-fuel-for-agricultural-vehicles">Rebated fuel for agricultural vehicles</h2>

<p>There are certain categories of vehicle which are not defined as road vehicles and can therefore use rebated fuel, otherwise known as ‘red diesel’.</p>

<h3 id="unlicensed-vehicles-not-used-on-public-roads">Unlicensed vehicles not used on public roads</h3>

<p>If you own a vehicle that is not used on the public road and has no licence under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, it is an excepted vehicle.</p>

<p>A vehicle can qualify as an exempted vehicle in the unlicensed category if it is not registered with the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licence Agency">DVLA</abbr> or if a Statutory Off Road Notification (<abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>) is made.</p>

<p>This includes vehicles that have not been taxed since before the 31 January 1998, which are not required to make a <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>.</p>

<p>It is a criminal offence to use a vehicle on a public road that is not registered with the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licence Agency">DVLA</abbr> or has a <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="tractors">Tractors</h3>

<p>A tractor qualifies as an excepted vehicle if it is designed and constructed primarily for off-road use. An excepted tractor can be used on a public road solely for:</p>

<ul>
<li>agriculture, horticulture or forestry work</li>
  <li>cutting verges bordering public roads</li>
  <li>cutting hedges or trees bordering public roads or bordering verges which border public roads</li>
</ul>
<p>Tractors with a vehicle excise licence - such as a general haulage vehicle - cannot use red diesel either on or off public roads, regardless of whether it is undertaking agricultural, horticultural or forestry work. This is because it is licensed to perform other work and is not therefore assumed to be used solely for agriculture, horticulture or forestry.</p>

<h3 id="light-agricultural-vehicles">Light agricultural vehicles</h3>

<p>For a vehicle to qualify as a light agricultural vehicle, it must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a revenue weight not exceeding 1,000 kilograms</li>
  <li>be designed and constructed so as to seat only the driver</li>
  <li>be designed and constructed primarily for use otherwise than on roads</li>
  <li>be used solely for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry</li>
</ul>
<p>The revenue weight of a vehicle is either the maximum weight of the vehicle or the design weight as defined in section 60A of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act.</p>

<p>Quad bikes and similar single-seater machines used for agricultural, horticultural or forestry work are classed as light agricultural vehicles.</p>

<h3 id="agricultural-material-handlers">Agricultural material handlers</h3>

<p>For a vehicle to qualify as an agricultural material handler, it must be designed to lift goods or burden. It must also be designed and constructed primarily for off-road use.</p>

<p>This category is restricted to material handlers used on public roads solely for:</p>

<ul>
<li>agricultural, horticultural or forestry work</li>
  <li>cutting verges bordering public roads</li>
  <li>cutting hedges or trees bordering public roads or bordering verges which border public roads</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="agricultural-engines">Agricultural engines</h3>

<p>Agricultural engines are restricted to purpose-built vehicles that:</p>

<ul>
<li>are designed and used solely for agriculture, horticulture or forestry work</li>
  <li>are used on public roads only for going to and from a place of work</li>
  <li>if used on a public road, do not carry any load except such as is necessary for its propulsion or for the operation of any machinery built-in or permanently attached to the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of vehicles that use agricultural engines include:</p>

<ul>
<li>combine harvesters</li>
  <li>crop sprayers</li>
  <li>forage harvesters</li>
  <li>pea viners</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="agricultural-processing-vehicles">Agricultural processing vehicles</h3>

<p>Agricultural processing vehicles - such as mobile seed cleaning machines or feed milling machines - are specialist vehicles that:</p>

<ul>
<li>are used for the movement of built-in machinery - for processing agricultural, horticultural or forestry produce - used while the vehicle is stationary</li>
  <li>are used on public roads only for going to and from a place of work</li>
  <li>if used on a public road, do not carry any load except such as is necessary for its propulsion or for the operation of the processing machinery</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vehicles-used-between-different-parts-of-the-land">Vehicles used between different parts of the land</h3>

<p>An agricultural vehicle can be used on more than one piece of land if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>is used only for agriculture, horticulture or forestry work</li>
  <li>is used on public roads only when passing between different areas of land occupied by the same person</li>
  <li>does not travel further than 1.5 kilometres on a public road when passing between two such areas and has a nil licence in force in respect</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mowing-machines">Mowing machines</h3>

<p>A mowing machine must be a complete vehicle - machinery built into the vehicle - whether pedestrian-operated or ride-on.</p>

<h3 id="edward-dales-top-tips">Edward Dale’s top tips:</h3>

<p>Edward Dale is an arable and combinable crop farmer from Lincolnshire. He outlines the benefits of controlled traffic farming: water soaks through the ground better, increased yields, less fuel usage, less time establishing a crop and more fertile soil: “Every time we go into a field we use the same wheeling. We’ve reduced the amount of the time we are in the field, and there’s more land for direct drilling. Diesel usage has gone from 120 litres a hectare down to around 60 litres a hectare.”</p>
