<h2>Casual or irregular work: working out employment status</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A person may be an employee in employment law but HM Revenue &amp; Customs may regard them as having a different <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/esi.htm%20%E2%80%9CEmployment%20Status%20Indicator%E2%80%9D" rel="external">employment status for tax purposes.</a></p>

</ul>
<p>Some of these rights require a minimum length of <a href="/continuous-employment-what-it-is" title="Continuous employment">continuous employment</a> before an employee qualifies for them. An employment contract may state how long this qualification period is.</p>

<h2>Working out employment status for an employee</h2>
<p>If the majority of the statements below apply to someone who works for a business, it’s likely they’re an employee:</p>

<ul>
<li>they’re required to work regularly unless they’re on leave (eg <a href="/holiday-entitlement-your-rights/overview" title="Holiday entitlement">holiday</a>, <a href="/taking-sick-leave" title="Taking sick leave">sick leave</a> or <a href="/maternity-leave" title="Maternity Leave">maternity leave</a>)</li>

  <li>they get paid holiday</li>
  <li>they’re entitled to contractual or Statutory <a href="/statutory-sick-pay-ssp" title="Statutory Sick Pay">Sick,</a> <a href="/statutory-maternity-pay" title="Statutory Maternity Pay">Maternity,</a> or <a href="/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay" title="Ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay">Paternity</a> Pay </li>
  <li>they can join the business’s pension scheme</li>
  <li>the business’s disciplinary and grievance procedures apply to them</li>

  <li>their contract sets out redundancy procedures</li>
  <li>the business provides the materials, tools and equipment for their work</li>
  <li>they only work for the business or if they do have another job, it’s completely different from their work for the business</li>
  <li>their contract, statement of terms and conditions or offer letter (which can be described as an <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview" title="Employment contracts">‘employment contract’</a>) uses terms like ‘employer’ and ‘employee’ </li>
</ul></article><article id="selfemployed"><header><h1>Part 4: Self-employed</h1>
  </header><p>A person is self-employed if they’re in business for themselves. They must tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) as soon as possible if they’re self-employed otherwise they may be fined.</p>

<p>Employment legislation does not generally cover self-employed people because they are, in effect, their own boss.</p>

<p>If a person is self-employed:</p>

<ul>
<li>they still have protection for their health and safety and, in some cases, protection against <a href="/discrimination-your-rights" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>
</li>
  <li>their rights and responsibilities would be set out by the terms of the contract they have with your client</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may regard someone as self-employed for tax purposes but they might have a different status in employment law.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="director"><header><h1>Part 5: Director</h1>
  </header><p>Company directors run limited companies on behalf of shareholders.</p>

<p>Directors have different rights and responsibilities from employees:</p>

<ul>
<li>company directors are classed as office holders for tax and <a href="/national-insurance-contributions-nics-for-employers/overview" title="National Insurance contributions for employers">National Insurance contribution</a> purposes</li>
  <li>the rights and duties of a director are different than for employees</li>
  <li>if a person does other work that’s not related to being a director, they may have an employment contract and get employment rights</li>
</ul></article><article id="contractor"><header><h1>Part 6: Contractor</h1>
  </header><p>A contractor can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/employment-status/selfemployed" title="Self-employed">self-employed</a></li>
  <li>a <a href="/employment-status/worker" title="Employment status">worker</a> or an <a href="/employment-status/employee" title="Employee">employee</a> if they work for a client and are employed by an agency</li>
</ul>
<p>If a contractor is an employee and they provide their services through a third party (eg their own limited company), an employer doesn’t have to make <a href="/national-insurance-contributions-nics-for-employers/overview" title="National Insurance contributions (NICs) for employers">National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>)</a> or deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>.</p>

<p>There is a special scheme for self-employed contractors and sub-contractors working in the construction industry called the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/" title="Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)">Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>).</a></p>

<p>A Managed service company (<abbr title="Managed service company">MSC</abbr>) is an intermediary company where workers can provide services to clients.  Employers would pay the worker through the <abbr title="Managed service company">MSC</abbr>. The <abbr title="Managed service company">MSC</abbr> is responsible for paying workers’ <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Independent contractors: working out employment status</h2>
<p>If most of the statements below apply to someone, it’s likely that they’re self-employed because they:</p>

<ul>
<li>put in bids or give quotes to get work</li>
  <li>have specific pieces of work or projects to do but decide how to do the work</li>
  <li>aren’t under direct supervision when working</li>
  <li>can hire someone else to do the work</li>
  <li>submit invoices for the work they’ve done</li>
  <li>are responsible for paying their own <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and tax</li>
  <li>don’t get holiday or sick pay when they aren’t working</li>
  <li>have to do unsatisfactory work again in their own time and at their own expense </li>
  <li>are responsible for losses and taking profits from their work</li>
  <li>can provide services to a number of different clients or customers</li>
  <li>operate under a contract (sometimes known as a ‘contract for services’ or ‘consultancy agreement’) that uses terms like ‘self-employed’, ‘consultant’, or an ‘independent contractor’ </li>
</ul></article><article id="legal-decisions-on-employment-status"><header><h1>Part 7: Legal decisions on employment status</h1>
  </header><p>A court or <a href="/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal" title="Employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a> (known as an <a rel="external" href="http://www.employmenttribunalsni.co.uk/" title="industrial tribunal">industrial tribunal</a> in Northern Ireland) can make a final decision on employment status. They will look at how the employment relationship between the person and the business works in practice.</p>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) may regard someone as self-employed for tax purposes. However, an employment tribunal or court may still make a decision that they are a worker or employee for employment rights purposes. </p>
