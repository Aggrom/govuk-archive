  </header><p>In employment law a person’s employment status helps determine their rights, and their employer’s responsibilities.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>In tax law a person may have a different employment status. You can check this using the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/esi.htm" title="Employment Status Indicator" rel="external">Employment Status Indicator.</a></p>

</ul>
<h2>Casual or irregular work</h2>

<p>If someone does casual or irregular work for a business and most of the statements below apply to them, it’s likely they’re a worker:</p>

<ul>
<li>they occasionally do work for a specific business </li>
  <li>the business doesn’t have to offer them work and they don’t have to accept it – they only work when they want to</li>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A person may be an employee in employment law but HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) may regard them as having a different <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/esi.htm" title="Employment Status Indicator" rel="external">employment status for tax purposes.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Employment rights</h2>
<p>All employees are workers, but an employee has extra employment rights and responsibilities which don’t apply to workers who aren’t employees. </p>

<p>These rights include all of the rights <a href="/employment-status/worker" title="Worker">workers</a> have and:</p>

<ul>

</ul>
<p>Some of these rights require a minimum length of <a href="/continuous-employment-what-it-is" title="Continuous employment">continuous employment</a> before an employee qualifies for them. An employment contract may state how long this qualification period is.</p>

<h2>Working out employment status for an employee</h2>
<p>If most of the statements below apply to someone who works for a business, it’s likely they’re an employee:</p>

<ul>
<li>they’re required to work regularly unless they’re on leave (eg <a href="/holiday-entitlement-rights" title="Holiday entitlement">holiday</a>, <a href="/taking-sick-leave" title="Taking sick leave">sick leave</a> or <a href="/maternity-leave" title="Maternity Leave">maternity leave</a>)</li>

  <li>they can’t send someone else to do their work</li>
  <li>the business deducts tax and National Insurance contributions from their wages</li>
  <li>they get paid holiday</li>
  <li>they’re entitled to contractual or Statutory <a href="/statutory-sick-pay-ssp" title="Statutory Sick Pay">Sick,</a> <a href="/statutory-maternity-pay" title="Statutory Maternity Pay">Maternity,</a> or <a href="/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay" title="Ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay">Paternity</a> Pay </li>
  <li>they can join the business’s pension scheme</li>
  <li>the business’s disciplinary and grievance procedures apply to them</li>
  <li>they work at the business’s premises or at an address specified by the business</li>
  <li>their contract sets out redundancy procedures</li>
  <li>the business provides the materials, tools and equipment for their work</li>
  <li>they only work for the business or if they do have another job, it’s completely different from their work for the business</li>
  <li>their contract, statement of terms and conditions or offer letter (which can be described as an <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview" title="Employment contracts">‘employment contract’</a>) uses terms like ‘employer’ and ‘employee’ </li>
</ul></article><article id="selfemployed"><header><h1>Part 4: Self-employed</h1>
  </header><p>A person is self-employed if they’re in business for themselves. They must tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) as soon as possible if they’re self-employed otherwise they may be fined.</p>

<p>Employment legislation does not generally cover self-employed people because they are, in effect, their own boss.</p>

<p>If a person is self-employed:</p>

<ul>
<li>they still have protection for their health and safety and, in some cases, protection against <a href="/discrimination-your-rights" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a>
</li>
  <li>their rights and responsibilities would be set out by the terms of the contract they have with your client</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may regard someone as self-employed for tax purposes but they might have a different status in employment law.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="contractor"><header><h1>Part 5: Contractor</h1>
  </header><p>A contractor can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/employment-status/selfemployed" title="Self-employed">self-employed</a></li>
  <li>a <a href="/employment-status/worker" title="Employment status">worker</a> or an <a href="/employment-status/employee" title="Employee">employee</a> if they work for a client and are employed by an agency</li>
</ul>
<p>If a contractor is an employee and they provide their services through a third party (eg their own limited company), the employer doesn’t have to make <a href="/national-insurance-contributions-for-employers" title="National Insurance contributions (NICs) for employers">National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>)</a> or deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax.</p>

<p>There is a special scheme for self-employed contractors and sub-contractors working in the construction industry called the <a href="/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme" title="Construction Industry Scheme">Construction Industry Scheme</a> (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>).</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/employment-status/msc.htm" title="managed service company">managed service company</a> (<abbr title="Managed service company">MSC</abbr>) is an intermediary company through which workers can provide services to clients. The <abbr title="Managed service company">MSC</abbr> is responsible for paying workers’ <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax.</p>

<h2>Independent contractors: working out employment status</h2>
<p>If most of the statements below apply to someone, it’s likely that they’re self-employed because they:</p>

<ul>
<li>put in bids or give quotes to get work</li>
  <li>have specific pieces of work or projects to do but decide how to do the work</li>
  <li>aren’t under direct supervision when working</li>
  <li>can hire someone else to do the work</li>
  <li>submit invoices for the work they’ve done</li>
  <li>are responsible for paying their own <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and tax</li>
  <li>don’t get holiday or sick pay when they aren’t working</li>
  <li>have to do unsatisfactory work again in their own time and at their own expense </li>
  <li>are responsible for losses and taking profits from their work</li>
  <li>can provide services to a number of different clients or customers</li>
  <li>operate under a contract (sometimes known as a ‘contract for services’ or ‘consultancy agreement’) that uses terms like ‘self-employed’, ‘consultant’, or an ‘independent contractor’ </li>
</ul></article><article id="director"><header><h1>Part 6: Director</h1>
  </header><p>Company directors run <a href="/running-a-limited-company" title="Running a limited company">limited companies</a> on behalf of shareholders.</p>

<p>Directors have different rights and responsibilities from employees, and are classed as <a href="/employment-status/office-holder" title="Office holder">office holders</a> for tax and <a href="/national-insurance-contributions-for-employers" title="National Insurance contributions for employers">National Insurance contribution</a> purposes.</p>

<p>If a person does other work that’s not related to being a director, they may have an employment contract and get employment rights.</p>

</article><article id="office-holder"><header><h1>Part 7: Office holder</h1>
  </header><p>A person who’s been appointed to a position by a company or organisation but doesn’t have a contract or receive regular payment may be an office holder. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>statutory appointments, eg registered company directors or secretaries, board members of statutory bodies, or crown appointments</li>
  <li>appointments under the internal constitution of an organisation, eg club treasurers or trade union secretaries</li>
  <li>appointments under a trust deed, eg trustees</li>
  <li>ecclesiastical appointment, eg members of the clergy</li>
</ul>
<p>Office holders are neither employees nor workers. However, it’s possible for someone to be an office holder and an employee if they have an employment contract with the same company or organisation that meets the criteria for <a href="/employment-status/employee" title="employee">employees</a>.</p>

<h2>Working out employment status for an office holder</h2>

<p>If most of the statements below apply to someone, it’s likely that they’re an office holder:</p>

<ul>
<li>there is no contract or service agreement relating to their appointment</li>
  <li>their duties are minimal, and are only those required under the relevant statute, constitution or trust deed</li>
  <li>they don’t get a salary or any other form of regular payment for their services</li>
  <li>the only payment they get is a voluntary payment (‘honorarium’), regardless of the work they do - tax and National Insurance are deducted by the appointing body</li>
  <li>they’re effectively working as an independent office, and are not under the close supervision or control of the appointing body</li>
</ul></article><article id="legal-decisions-on-employment-status"><header><h1>Part 8: Legal decisions on employment status</h1>
  </header><p>A court or <a href="/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal" title="Employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a> (known as an <a rel="external" href="http://www.employmenttribunalsni.co.uk/" title="industrial tribunal">industrial tribunal</a> in Northern Ireland) can make a final decision on employment status. They will look at how the employment relationship between the person and the business works in practice.</p>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) may regard someone as self-employed for tax purposes. However, an employment tribunal or court may still make a decision that they are a worker or employee for employment rights purposes. </p>
