<h2 id="life-sciences-in-the-uk">Life sciences in the UK</h2>

<p>The UK has one of the strongest and most productive life sciences industries in the world, contributing to patient well-being as well as supporting growth.</p>

<p>The industry is high-tech, innovative and highly diverse, spanning pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, and industrial biotechnology and has applications across many other sectors. Through the development of innovative medicines, medical technologies and services, its businesses contribute to a stronger and fairer society, helping people enjoy better health, well-being and quality of life. They are also helping the UK improve its sustainability and increase rates of decarbonisation.</p>

<p>The government is building on and fostering these strengths and responding to the changing global commercial environment. We want to make the UK the location of choice for pioneering life sciences <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> and manufacturing investment, so that life sciences will continue to be vibrant in the UK and a contributor to sustained economic growth and health improvements. To this end we are currently implementing the measures outlined in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-1429-strategy-for-uk-life-sciences.pdf">‘Strategy for UK life sciences’</a></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of Life Sciences">OLS</abbr> works closely with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">Department of Health</a>, championing biotechnology and the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. We also work with <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk">UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI)</a>, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk">Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)</a> and other departments, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>)</a>, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk">NHS</a> and the life sciences industry.</p>

<h2 id="views-on-the-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research">Views on the use of animals in scientific research</h2>

<p>The Ipsos MORI report <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/ipsos-mori-views-on-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research-september-2012.pdf">‘Views on the use of animals in scientific research’</a> presents the findings of a 2012 survey on awareness of, and public attitudes towards, the use of animals in scientific research. This survey has been carried out since 1999 on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The report shows that 85% of the representative sample conditionally accept the use of animals in scientific research. While this year’s findings show a decline in overall public acceptance, it also identifies that a significant proportion of the representative sample (40%) would like to know more information about the use of animals in scientific research before forming a firm opinion.</p>

<p>The government has challenged the scientific community to respond to these findings.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-for-uk-life-sciences">Strategy for UK life sciences</h2>

<p>On 5 December 2011, the Prime Minister launched the government’s strategy to help life sciences businesses grow and succeed. The strategy focuses on the health-related aspects of the sector. </p>

<p>It is a long-term strategy, looking forward 10 to 15 years and building on the March 2011 <a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf">‘Plan for growth’</a>. It was launched alongside, and is being implemented in collaboration with, the NHS Chief Executive’s Review: <a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299">‘Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating adoption and diffusion in the NHS’</a>.</p>

<p>The strategy for UK life sciences is based on 3 aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>building a UK life sciences ‘ecosystem’ - the government is making it easier for researchers to commercialise academic research, placing clinical research at the heart of the NHS, and empowering patients to participate in research</li>
  <li>attracting, developing and rewarding talent - the government is introducing measures to attract and nurture world-leading talent and develop scientific excellence; these measures will ensure that the UK offers exciting and rewarding careers for clinicians, scientists and technicians from all around the world </li>
  <li>overcoming barriers and creating incentives for the promotion of healthcare innovation - the government is introducing measures to incentivise early-stage investment and nurture the best innovations and will also continue to reduce the bureaucracy of setting up clinical trials to ensure that patients have access to promising, cost-effective, new treatments</li>
</ul>
<p>A report on the bioscience and health technology database, <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-p90-strength-and-opportunity-2011-medical-technology-sectors.pdf">‘Strength and opportunity 2011’</a> was published on 5 December 2011.</p>

<h2 id="areas-of-work-for-the-ols">Areas of work for the <abbr title="Office of Life Sciences">OLS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The work of the <abbr title="Office of Life Sciences">OLS</abbr> is focused on 2 areas: healthcare and the bio-economy. The healthcare team works with the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
<li>pharmaceutical</li>
  <li>medical biotechnology</li>
  <li>medical technology – devices and diagnostics</li>
</ul>
<p>The bio-economy team works with the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
<li>industrial biotechnology</li>
  <li>agricultural biotechnology</li>
</ul>
<p>These teams work across a range of policy areas supporting business growth:</p>

<ul>
<li>NHS market access</li>
  <li>innovation</li>
  <li>skills</li>
  <li>finance and tax</li>
  <li>bio-economy</li>
  <li>infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nhs-market-access">NHS market access</h3>

<p>The market access team works closely with the other <abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> teams, the Department of Health, and other departments and agencies. The NHS is a major contributor to economic growth, and we work together to maximise this contribution and to address any barriers to innovation.</p>

<p>Main areas of interest for the market access team are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the reforms to the NHS, including the introduction of value-based pricing</li>
  <li>the NHS procurement strategy</li>
  <li>engaging with <abbr title="Department of Health">DH</abbr>’s delivery of <a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299">‘Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating uptake and diffusion of innovation in the NHS’</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, we are considering how these will create opportunities for the business environment and support the growth agenda. </p>

<h3 id="innovation">Innovation</h3>

<p>Our focus is to ensure that industry has the right environment to innovate and in particular to remove barriers.</p>

<p>We are currently focusing on:</p>

<h4 id="regenerative-medicine">Regenerative medicine</h4>

<ul>
<li>improving the impact of the £25 million <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukrmp.org.uk/">UK Regenerative Medicine Platform</a> which addresses the technical and scientific challenges associated with translating promising scientific discoveries in this area towards clinical impact</li>
  <li>contributing to the House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into Regenerative Medicine</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="medicines-licensing">Medicines licensing</h4>

<ul>
<li>working with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> on the government’s commitment to consult on an Early Access Scheme for Medicines </li>
  <li>exploring more progressive approaches to medicines regulations, including adaptive licensing, through the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Expert Group on Healthcare Regulation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="clinical-trials-environment">Clinical trials environment</h4>

<ul>
<li>working with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> on the European Commission’s plans to replace the European Clinical Trials Directive with a Regulation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="open-innovation">Open innovation</h4>

<p>Given the changing <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> landscape and a growing interest in new ways of partnership working, we organised a seminar on Open Innovation in May 2012. Relevant public sector organisations including the Intellectual Property Office, Technology Strategy Board, Clinical Practice Research Datalink as well as private sector interest (AstraZeneca (PPT, 2.6 Mb), Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst and Johnson &amp; Johnson discussed the opportunities of the approach to the life sciences.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-projects">Infrastructure projects</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> is co-funding 2 key investment projects to stimulate further growth and address market failures by providing incubation facilities for new companies. These bioincubators are based in Stevenage in Hertfordshire, alongside the GlaxoSmithKline <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> headquarters, and on the Edinburgh BioQuarter site.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> has also co-funded the Industrial Biotechnology 10,000 litre Demonstrator in Wilton, an open access facility to enable companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, to trial different biomass feedstock  and processes to manufacture biobased products.</p>

<h4 id="stevenage-bioscience-catalyst">Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst</h4>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.stevenagecatalyst.com">Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst</a> will be the first purpose-built, open innovation campus for drug discovery and development. It will maximise the economic impact of academic and science expertise and foster a successful open innovation model between big pharmaceutical and small bioscience companies. It will act as a catalyst to position the UK at the forefront of scientific innovation.</p>

<p>The catalyst will be located alongside the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> Headquarters in Stevenage and is being developed in stages. Phase 1 comprises the construction of BioIncubator and Accelerator buildings for early-stage bioscience companies. Phase 1 is being funded by <abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>, the East of England Development Agency (EEDA), the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), GSK and the Wellcome Trust. </p>

<p>Future phases will bring the catalyst up to 45,000 square metres by 2016, assuming that the market demand is as expected. This is forecast to create 1500 new jobs and stimulate the creation of up to 5 new businesses. All future phases will be commercially funded.</p>

<h4 id="edinburgh-bioquarter---bioincubator">Edinburgh BioQuarter - BioIncubator</h4>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.edinburghbioquarter.com">Edinburgh BioQuarter</a> is a landmark life sciences hub that is establishing Edinburgh and Scotland as one of the world’s top 10 centres for biomedical research and commercialisation. The project is a long-term life science property and commercialisation partnership between Scottish Enterprise, the University of Edinburgh, the NHS and US-based private sector partner, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. The 100-acre site already houses the University of Edinburgh Queen’s Medical Research Institute and the 870-bed Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh teaching hospital.  </p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> and Scottish Enterprise are co-funding the creation of the BioIncubator.  This investment is expected to leverage almost £210m of additional investment and create or retain over 700 high-value jobs. This will enhance the global reputation of the UK as a place for leading life science innovation, by creating an infrastructure for supporting industry to collaborate with academic and clinical research.</p>

<p>The University of Edinburgh is aiming to produce 18 new life sciences companies over the next 5 years which will add a considerable pipeline of demand for the BioIncubator. </p>

<h4 id="industrial-biotechnology-demonstrator">Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator</h4>

<p>Located in Wilton in the Tees Valley, the new <a rel="external" href="http://www.uk-cpi.com/industrial-biotechnology/demonstrator">National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator</a> is an open access facility of a unique scale of 10,000-litre working volume capacity. The demonstrator has 2 main applications: it can be used as a proof of concept facility to scale-up the production of materials to near commercial levels; and as a product manufacturing facility for clients experiencing temporary capacity restrictions.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator">NIBF</abbr> will allow biotechnology companies to de-risk product and process development. By exploring and then optimising processes, companies will be are able to calculate the most cost-effective combination of materials; process steps and sequences; and the equipment needed to manufacture profitably. Consequently, they will minimise the risk of investing in the wrong capital equipment, using inefficient processes or facing unexpected costs.</p>
