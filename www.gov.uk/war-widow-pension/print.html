  </header><h2>Changes in your circumstances</h2>

<p>If you’re a War Widow, War Widower whose late spouse or civil partner left service before 31 March 1973, you can keep your pension if you remarry or start to live with a partner after 6 April 2005.</p>

<p>Otherwise you must tell the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency straight away, this is because your War Widow or Widowers Pension will stop, although if you’re getting children’s allowances you may continue to get them.</p>

<ul>
<li>you become widowed again </li>
  <li>your marriage ends in divorce or judicial separation </li>
  <li>your civil partnership ends due to death </li>
  <li>your civil partnership ends in dissolution </li>
  <li>you stop living with the person as their partner or civil partner </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you tell Service Personnel and Veterans Agency of any changes in your circumstances so you get the right amount of pension.</p>

<h2>How to appeal</h2>

<p>If you disagree with a decision about your claim you can appeal to an independent Pensions Appeal Tribunal. </p>

<p>Before you appeal it’s a good idea to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency for more information about how the decision was reached </li>
  <li>ask for the decision to be reconsidered if there are some facts the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency may not have known when they made their decision </li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re still unhappy with the outcome <a rel="external" href="http://www.veterans-uk.info/index.htm/" title="contact the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">contact the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency</a> to let them know that you want to appeal.</p>

<h2>Funeral Expenses</h2>

<p>The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency may be able to pay you a grant of up to £2,200 towards a funeral to a widow or widower, next of kin or person paying for the funeral if:</p>

<ul>
<li>death was due to service before 6 April 2005 </li>
  <li>War Pensions Constant Attendance Allowance was being paid or would have been paid if the war pensioner had not been in hospital when they died </li>
  <li>Unemployability Supplement was being paid at the time of death and the War Disablement Pension was assessed at 80% or more </li>
