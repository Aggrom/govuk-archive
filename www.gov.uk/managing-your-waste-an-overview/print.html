  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You must deal responsibly with any waste your business produces. This is known as your ‘duty of care’. Business waste includes any waste that comes from:</p>

<ul>
<li>construction </li>
  <li>demolition </li>
  <li>industry </li>
  <li>agriculture</li>
  <li>any commercial activity - including any you run from your home </li>
</ul>
<p>Your duty of care lasts from the moment the waste is produced to when it’s received by a business that is authorised to deal with it. For example, a licensed disposal site. </p>

</article><article id="duty-of-care"><header><h1>Part 2: Duty of care</h1>
  </header><p>You must: </p>

<ul>
<li>consider alternatives to disposal - eg recycling </li>
  <li>
<a href="/managing-your-waste-an-overview/storage" title="Storing waste">store your waste</a> safely and securely </li>
  <li>fill in a <a href="/managing-your-waste-an-overview/transporting" title="Transporting waste">waste transfer note</a> for each load of waste you transport </li>
  <li>usually get a licence to transport, store, treat, recover or dispose of your waste yourself </li>
  <li>check that any business you use to deal with your waste is licensed, and keep proof of this - eg take a copy of their licence  </li>
</ul>
<p>For construction projects over £300,000 in England, you must carry out a <a rel="external" href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/site-waste-management-plans-1" title="Site Waste Management Plans">site waste management plan.</a></p>

<p>You have extra responsibilities if you’re <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/waste/hazardouswaste.htm" title="hazardous waste">dealing with hazardous waste.</a></p>

<h2>Find a licensed waste business</h2>

<p>There are public registers for England and Wales you can use to find:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a rel="external" href="http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/dataSearchController?lang=_e&amp;textonly=off&amp;topic=wastedirectory" title="Waste directory datasearch">business that can recycle or dispose of your waste</a>
</li>
  <li>a <a href="/find-registered-waste-carrier" title="Find a collection company to take away your waste">collection company to take away your waste</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Scotland, use the Zero Waste Scotland <a rel="external" href="http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/business-re-use-and-recycling-directory" title="Search for business re-use and recycling services in Scotland">business re-use and recycling directory.</a></p>

<h2>Get a waste licence</h2>

<p>Usually you have to be licensed to transport, store, treat or dispose of waste. To get a licence:</p>

<ul>
<li>to transport waste - <a href="/register-waste-carrier/how-to-apply" title="Register as a waste carrier">register as a waste carrier</a>
</li>
  <li>to produce, store, treat or dispose of waste in England and Wales - <a href="/get-an-environmental-permit" title="Get an environmental permit">get an environmental permit</a>
</li>
  <li>to produce, store, treat or dispose of waste in Scotland - get a <a rel="external" href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/application_forms/waste_management_licence.aspx" title="Apply for a waste management licence (Scotland)">waste management licence</a> and/or a <a href="/pollution-prevention-and-control-permit-air-emissions-scotland" title="Apply for a pollution prevention and control permit (Scotland)">pollution prevention and control permit</a>
</li>
</ul></article><article id="storage"><header><h1>Part 3: Storage</h1>
  </header><p>You must store waste safely and securely. To do this: </p>

<ul>
<li>separate different wastes </li>
  <li>store waste in a secure place</li>
  <li>use suitable containers and label them clearly</li>
  <li>use covers to prevent waste blowing away </li>
  <li>use a waterproof cover if rain could cause contaminated run-off or prevent the waste from being reused </li>
  <li>use bunds to prevent liquid waste escaping - eg into a drain </li>
</ul>
<p>You may need a licence to store your own or other people’s waste. The licence will confirm any extra rules for storing waste on your site. </p>

</article><article id="transporting"><header><h1>Part 4: Transporting</h1>
  </header><h2>Waste transfer notes</h2>

<p>You must fill out a <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/40047.aspx" title="Waste transfer notes">waste transfer note</a> for each load of waste you transport. Waste transfer notes help show that you’re dealing with your waste properly. They must be kept for 2 years. </p>

<p>There are 2 types of waste transfer note:</p>

<ul>
<li>a single waste transfer note </li>
  <li>a season ticket waste transfer note - covers multiple transfers over a 12 month period </li>
</ul>
<p>You can only use a season ticket waste transfer note if the following don’t change:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of waste</li>
  <li>the site where the waste came from </li>
  <li>the producer, carrier and waste facility </li>
</ul>
<h2>Importing and exporting waste</h2>

<p>Most waste can’t be imported or exported if it’s for disposal (eg landfill). In almost all cases, you can only move waste to recover it. There are strict <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/32447.aspx" title="Regulations on the imports and exports of waste">regulations on importing and exporting waste.</a>   </p>

<p>Use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/124357.aspx" title="Export controls tool">export controls tool</a> to help you check what regulations you have to follow if you’re exporting waste to another country.</p>

<p>If you’re in Scotland, see the Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s (<abbr title="Scottish Environment Protection Agency">SEPA</abbr>) guidance on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/transfrontier_shipment.aspx" title="Guidance on the transfrontier shipment of waste">transfrontier shipment of waste.</a></p>
