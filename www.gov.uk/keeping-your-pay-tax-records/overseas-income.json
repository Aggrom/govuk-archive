If HMRC checks your tax return, they may ask for the documents. \r\n\r\n##How to keep your records\r\n\r\nThere are no rules on how you must keep records. You can keep them on paper, digitally or as part of a software program (like book-keeping software). \r\n\r\nIf they aren\u2019t accurate, complete and readable, HMRC can charge you a penalty (between 15% and 100% of any tax you owe).\r\n\r\n##Lost or destroyed records\r\n\r\nTry to get copies of as much as you can, eg ask banks for copies of statements, suppliers for duplicate invoice etc.\r\n\r\nIf you can't recreate all your records, you can use \u2018provisional\u2019 or \u2018estimated\u2019 figures. You must use the 'Any other information' box on the tax return to say that this is what you're doing.\r\n\r\n^'Provisional' means you\u2019ll be able to get paperwork to confirm your figures later. 'Estimated' means you won't be able to confirm the figures. ^\r\n\r\nIf your figures turn out to be wrong and you haven\u2019t paid enough tax, you may have to pay interest and penalties.\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenue & Customs","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"How long you need to keep your records depends on whether:\r\n\r\n- you're self-employed or not\r\n- you sent your tax return before or after the deadline\r\n\r\n###Self-employed sole trader, business partnership or partner\r\n\r\nIf you sent your tax return on or before the 31 January deadline, you must keep your records for at least 5 years and 10 months after the end of the tax year the tax return is for.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example** \r\n\r\nIf you send your 2011 to 2012 tax return by 31 January 2013, you must keep your records until at least the end of January 2018.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\nIf you sent your tax return after the 31 January deadline, you must keep your records for the longer of:\r\n\r\n- 5 years and 10 months after the end of the tax year the tax return is for\r\n- 15 months after you sent your tax return\r\n\r\n###Individuals and anyone else who sends a return\r\n\r\nIf you sent your tax return on or before the 31 January deadline, you should keep your records for at least 22 months after the end of the tax year the tax return is for.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example** \r\n\r\nIf you send your 2011 to 2012 tax return by 31 January 2013, you should keep your records until at least the end of January 2014.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\nIf you sent your tax return after the 31 January deadline, you should keep your records for at least 15 months after you sent it.\r\n","slug":"how-long-to-keep-your-records","title":"How long to keep your records"}},{"table":{"body":"##Income from employment\r\n\r\nYou should keep documents about your pay and tax, including:\r\n\r\n- your P45 - if you leave your job, this shows your pay and tax to the date you left\r\n- your P60 - if you're in a job on 5 April, this shows your pay and tax for the tax year\r\n- form P11D - this shows your expenses and benefits, like a company car or health insurance\r\n- certificates for any Taxed Award Schemes\r\n- information about any redundancy or termination payment\r\n\r\nYou should also keep details of any other income or benefits from your job not covered in the list above, including:\r\n\r\n- any tips received (unless your employer pays them through the 'tronc' system, which means they will have deducted tax already)\r\n- benefits you get in connection with your job from someone other than your employer, like meal vouchers\r\n- any lump sum payments not included on your P60 or P45, like incentive payments or 'golden hellos' (payments you get to encourage you to take a new job)\r\n\r\n##Expense records\r\n\r\nIf you've had to pay for things like tools, travel or specialist clothing for work, you can claim for these to reduce the tax you'll have to pay.
