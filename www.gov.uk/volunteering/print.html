  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="volunteers-rights"><header><h1>Part 1: Volunteers' rights</h1>
  </header><p>Most volunteers don’t have a contract of employment, so don’t have the rights of an employee or worker.</p>

<p>They are usually given a volunteer agreement that explains:</p>

<ul>
<li>the level of supervision and support they’ll get</li>
  <li>what training they’ll get</li>
  <li>whether they’re covered under the organisation’s employer or public liability insurance</li>
  <li>health and safety issues</li>
  <li>any <a href="/volunteering/pay-and-expenses" title="pay and expenses for volunteers">expenses</a> the organisation will cover</li>
</ul>
<p>The volunteer agreement isn’t compulsory, but sets out what volunteers can expect from the organisation. It doesn’t form a contract between the volunteer and the organisation. </p>

<p>The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) has information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/advice-support/workforce-development/hr-employment-practice/managing-volunteers/legal-status/" title="volunteers’ legal status on the National Council for Voluntary Organisations website">volunteers’ legal status.</a></p>


</article><article id="pay-and-expenses"><header><h1>Part 2: Pay and expenses</h1>
  </header><p>Volunteers aren’t paid for their time but may get money to cover expenses. This is usually limited to covering food, drink and travel or any equipment they need to buy. </p>

<p>If a volunteer gets any other payment, reward or benefit in kind, they may be classed as an <a href="/employment-status/employee" title="employment status: employee">employee</a> or <a href="/employment-status/worker" title="Employment status: worker">worker</a>, rather than a volunteer. This includes any promise of a contract or paid work in the future.</p>

<p>Being classed as an employee or worker gives them certain employment rights, like getting the <a href="/your-right-to-minimum-wage/" title="the minimum wage: who is entitled to it and how much it is">minimum wage</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Ellie volunteers at a company to get some work experience. She’s given travel expenses even though she walks to work. This is payment, rather than out-of-pocket expenses, so she must be paid at least the minimum wage.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Joe is an unpaid intern at a record company, but he’s given free CDs as a perk. The CDs are ‘benefits in kind’. They mean he must be paid at least the minimum wage.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<p>Amanda is a unpaid intern at a design company. She’s been promised that she’ll be taken on as an employee after 3 months. This counts as a reward, so she must be paid at least the minimum wage for the whole time she spends at the company.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="when-people-can-volunteer"><header><h1>Part 3: When people can volunteer</h1>
  </header><h2>Age limits</h2>

<p>There’s no upper age limit on volunteering. However, some organisations’ insurance policies don’t cover people under 16 or over a certain age (usually 80). </p>

<p>Under 14s <strong>can’t</strong> work for a profit-making organisation, even if they’re not paid. </p>

<p>Some local councils have bylaws with extra rules about the work young people can do. For example, they may see a charity shop as a profit-making organisation and not let young people volunteer there.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>People aged 50+ can find volunteering opportunities with the <a href="http://www.csv-rsvp.org.uk/site/home.htm" title="Retired and Senior Volunteering Programme" rel="external">Retired and Senior Volunteering Programme.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>People on benefits</h2>

<p>People can volunteer and claim benefits if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the only money they get from volunteering is to cover expenses, like travel costs</li>
  <li>they continue to meet the conditions of the benefit they get</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>Criminal records</h2>

<p>People with criminal records can volunteer but depending on the offence they may not be able to volunteer in certain roles. They might need a <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check" title="get a Criminal Records Bureau check">criminal records check</a> if they want to volunteer with children or vulnerable adults. </p>
