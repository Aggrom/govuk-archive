<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Eggs and Chicks (England) Regulations 2009 cover most aspects of egg production, marking, transport, grading, packing and onward marketing.</p>

<p>The regulations apply to eggs from laying hens sold for human consumption. They also cover hatching, farmyard poultry chicks, and in shell for human consumption, hen, turkey, goose, duck, and guinea fowl eggs.</p>

<p>Nearly all laying hen establishments must be registered and allocated a distinguishing number, and almost all eggs sold at retail level within the EU must be marked with a code identifying the establishment, country of origin and method of production.</p>

<p>This guide is aimed at businesses involved in the production of hen eggs for human consumption, including hen laying establishments and egg packing centres. It explains regulations on the marketing and trading of eggs, registration, egg marking and inspections, salmonella and egg quality. It also covers rules relating to the international trade of eggs.</p>

<h2 id="registration-of-laying-hen-establishments">Registration of laying hen establishments</h2>

<p>The Registration of Establishments (Laying Hens) Regulations 2003 require all laying hen establishments with 350 or more laying hens - whether from caged, barn, free range or organic egg-producing hens - to be registered with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) Egg Marketing Inspectorate (<abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You must also register with <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr> as a producer if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have 50 or more hens and any of your eggs are marketed at a local public market</li>
  <li>any of your eggs are marketed to registered packing centres</li>
</ul>
<p>Note too that if you sell eggs to shops, restaurants or bakeries, you will need to be approved and authorised as a packing centre by <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr> in order to be permitted to grade them as Class A eggs.</p>

<p>Registration with the <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr> is free. The <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr> will then allocate your establishment with a distinguishing number which is made up of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a digit indicating the farming method</li>
  <li>the country of origin ISO code</li>
  <li>a unique identification number for the establishment</li>
</ul>
<p>This number must be stamped on all eggs graded as Class A. </p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/egg-and-milk/index.htm">find <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr> guidance and forms on the Animal Health website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="great-britain-poultry-register">Great Britain Poultry Register</h3>

<p>If you keep more than 50 poultry of any kind - and of any mix - you must register separately with the Great Britain Poultry Register. For information on how to register and comply with legislation for keeping broiler chickens, laying hens and other poultry species, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/poultry-farms-general-regulations">Poultry farms: general regulations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="egg-marking-regulations">Egg marking regulations</h2>

<p>The Egg (Marketing Standards) Regulations requires that all Class (Grade) A eggs sold at retail level and public markets within the EU must be stamped with a code identifying the:</p>

<ul>
<li>method of production - eg organic, free range, barn or cage</li>
  <li>country of origin</li>
  <li>hen laying establishment</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few exceptions - the regulations do not apply in full to hen eggs sold directly to the consumer for their own use:</p>

<ul>
<li>by the producer on their own farm</li>
  <li>by the producer through door-to-door selling</li>
  <li>by the producer in a local public market</li>
</ul>
<p>In these circumstances, no use of the quality or weight grading terms may be made.</p>

<p>Stamping eggs tells the consumer where the eggs have come from and their level of quality. It can also help <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s egg marking inspectors to trace eggs and enforce EU Egg Marketing Regulations. This can be particularly useful in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. </p>

<p>If you have fewer than 50 birds and sell at a public market you do not have to mark your eggs with a producer code. However, you must display your name, address, the best before date and advice on how to keep eggs chilled after purchase. You should also be aware that individual markets still may have their own rules which require the stamping of a producer code on hen eggs.</p>

<p>If you have 50 or more hens you will need to be registered and stamp eggs with your producer code along with the best before date and advice to keep eggs chilled after purchase.</p>

<h3 id="the-lion-mark">The Lion Mark</h3>

<p>The Lion Mark indicates that eggs are produced to a stringent code of practice operated by the British Egg Industry Council. Around 85 per cent of UK eggs are stamped with the British Lion Mark accreditation.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.britegg.co.uk">find information about the British Lion Mark on the British Egg Information Service website</a>.</p>

<p>The Laid in Britain Scheme is a consortium of independent egg producers and packers which markets locally and regionally with traceable produce. <a rel="external" href="http://www.laidinbritaineggs.co.uk/index.php">Read about the Laid in Britain Scheme and the UK Egg Producers (<abbr title="UK Egg Producers">UKEP</abbr>) Association on the Laid in Britain website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="egg-marketing-inspectors">Egg marketing inspectors</h2>

<p><abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorates">EMIs</abbr> are responsible for enforcing the legislation which covers the production and marketing of eggs up to, but not including, retail and catering level. However, <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorates">EMIs</abbr> can carry out inspections at retail and catering premises if required.</p>

<p><abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorates">EMIs</abbr> are part of Animal Health, which is an executive agency of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and is responsible for ensuring the welfare of farmed animals in the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorates">EMIs</abbr> work throughout England and Wales, wherever hen eggs are produced, graded, packed, imported and marketed in any way and at hatcheries. Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own inspectors. For more information on work and processes, you can call the <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr> South Administrative Centre on Tel 01823 337 922 or call the <abbr title="Egg Marketing Inspectorate">EMI</abbr> North Administrative Centre on Tel 0113 230 0100.</p>

<h2 id="regulations-relating-to-salmonella-control">Regulations relating to salmonella control</h2>

<p>Salmonella infection in eggs is a common cause of food poisoning in humans and can cause serious illness. In the case of poultry, there is a possibility of transmission of infection in or on eggs from both breeding and laying flocks. However, the industry has done a lot to minimise risks, and the introduction of regulations has further helped to improve the control and prevention of salmonella.</p>

<p>The Eggs and Chicks (England) Regulations 2009 introduced salmonella-related controls on the use of eggs intended for human consumption, in accordance with the salmonella National Control Programme (<abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr>) for laying hens. </p>

<p>The requirements of the <abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr> apply to all operators producing eggs on a commercial basis, except where:</p>

<ul>
<li>all production is for private domestic use</li>
  <li>the holding has fewer than 350 hens and supplies direct to the consumer or via local retailers</li>
</ul>
<p>All flocks on premises with more than 350 laying hens must comply with the salmonella <abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr>. Official sampling is done by Animal Health egg marketing inspectors, except for producers in either the:</p>

<ul>
<li>British Egg Industry Council Lion Code</li>
  <li>UK Egg Producer Retailer Association Laid in Britain schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not market eggs for human consumption which have originated from flocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>infected with salmonella enteritidis or salmonella typhimurium</li>
  <li>of ‘unknown health status’ (not tested according to the <abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr>) - unless those eggs are heat-treated (pasteurised) to eliminate the salmonella</li>
</ul>
<p>Keepers of laying flocks are also required to follow a sampling and testing programme set out in the <abbr title="National Control Programme">NCP</abbr> to assess whether salmonella is present on-farm.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/poultry-health">Poultry farming: health regulations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="disposal-of-poultry-waste-including-surplus-and-waste-eggs">Disposal of poultry waste including surplus and waste eggs</h2>

<p>If you keep more than 40,000 poultry - including chickens, layers, pullets, turkeys, ducks and guinea fowl - you must apply to the Environment Agency for an environmental permit to operate your facility. For more information, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/non-hazardous-waste-treatment-and-disposal">non-hazardous waste: treatment and disposal</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of the number of poultry you keep, you will have a duty of care to responsibly manage waste from your operations. </p>

<p>The disposal of any waste or surplus eggs comes under the control of the Animal By-Products Regulations, which control any eggs that are not sent for processing within the food or non-food industries. You are not permitted to dispose of whole or parts of eggs as general waste, use them for land spreading or send them to landfill.</p>

<p>You must instead dispose of waste at premises approved under Animal By-Products Regulations, which may include individual approved incinerators on your own egg-producing site.</p>

<p>Every part of an egg is considered at least as Category 3 waste - ie low risk, although in some the high risk Category 2 might apply - eg eggs from hens showing signs of transmissible disease - which places further restrictions on disposal options.</p>

<h2 id="international-trade">International trade</h2>

<p>If you are exporting eggs from, or importing eggs into, the UK, from third countries, there are EU regulations you need to follow. This includes regulations which determine:</p>

<ul>
<li>any payments made to exporters of eggs and poultry products from the EU</li>
  <li>the level of duty applicable to imports into the EU</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="levels-of-duty-excise-and-vat">Levels of duty, excise and VAT</h3>

<p>Eggs and egg products for import and export need to be classified with a commodity code. </p>
