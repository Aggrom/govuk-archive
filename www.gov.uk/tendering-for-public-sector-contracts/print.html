<p>Many public sector organisations keep lists of potential suppliers for certain types of work, particularly low-value contracts. Contact your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="find your local council">local council</a> or go direct to the organisation.</p>

<h2>Tendering opportunities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own dedicated public sector procurement websites. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.sell2wales.co.uk/help/1601.html" title="Sell2Wales">Sell2Wales</a> for opportunities with public sector bodies in Wales</li>

</ul>
<h2>The construction industry</h2>

<p>Many public sector buyers use <a rel="external" href="http://www.constructionline.co.uk/static/" title="Constructionlonline">Constructionline</a> to publish contract opportunities.</p>

<p>You’ll have to pay to register on Constructionline. Fees are on a sliding scale, depending on the size of your firm, and begin at £70 per year.</p>


</article><article id="the-procurement-process"><header><h1>Part 4: The procurement process</h1>
  </header><p>If you bid for a public sector contract, you’ll probably have to go through an official procurement process. There are 4 different procurement procedures used to award contracts.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re using Contracts Finder, the contract notice will say which procurement procedure is being used.</p>
</div>

<h2>Procurement procedures</h2>

<h3>The open procedure</h3>

<p>This is where all interested suppliers are asked to return tenders by a set date. These are then evaluated and the contract is awarded. This procedure is often used by local councils.</p>

<h3>The restricted procedure</h3>

<p>This is a 2-stage process. In the first stage, interested suppliers are asked to fill out a questionnaire and a short-list is drawn up. In the second stage, the shortlisted suppliers are invited to respond to an Invitation to Tender (<abbr title="Invitation to Tender">ITT</abbr>). The tenders are then evaluated and the contract awarded.</p>

<h3>The competitive dialogue procedure</h3>

<p>This procedure is used for more complex procurements. After a selection process, the buyer then negotiates with suppliers and invites chosen companies to put in a bid. Suppliers put in their tenders and the contract is awarded.</p>

<h3>The negotiated procedure</h3>

<p>In this procedure, the buyer enters into contract negotiations with one or more suppliers.</p>

<h2>Framework agreements</h2>

<p>If a public sector organisation knows they are likely to need particular goods or services, but are unsure about exactly what they’ll need or when, they may decide to set up a group of approved suppliers that they can use when necessary. This is called a ‘framework agreement’.</p>

<p>The organisation will invite potential suppliers to put themselves forward for the framework and choose the one(s) most able to do the work. Once the framework is set up, individual contracts are made throughout the period of the agreement. If there’s more than one possible supplier on the framework, a ‘mini-competition’ may be held to decide who gets the contract.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Framework agreements usually last for a maximum of 4 years.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="the-tendering-process"><header><h1>Part 5: The tendering process</h1>
  </header><h2>Tendering for a contract</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Once you’ve found a contract you might want to bid for, read it carefully to decide whether your business can do the work. If you’ve got any questions about the contract, you can contact the organisation for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you bid, you may have to send an ‘expression of interest’. This is an initial stage of the tendering process that helps buyers to see who’s interested in bidding and draw up a short-list of possible suppliers. You may be asked for information about your finances and experience, or references from previous clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re put on the short-list, you’ll get an ‘Invitation to Tender’ (<abbr title="Invitation to Tender">ITT</abbr>) or a contract notice inviting you to bid for the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contract notice and bid documents will explain what you need to do to submit your tender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit your tender with all the required information before the deadline.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The price you offer in a tender will be binding if your bid is successful.</p>

</div>

<h2>Getting feedback on unsuccessful tenders</h2>

<p>If you’re unsuccessful in a tender and want to find out why, public sector organisations must give you feedback within 20 working days if you ask for it.</p>

<p>Information about the contract is subject to the  <a href="/make-a-freedom-of-information-request" title="make a Freedom of Information Act request">Freedom of Information Act</a>. This means that you have a right to ask for detailed information about the bidding process - but you may have to pay for it.</p>


</article><article id="disclosing-information-in-your-tender"><header><h1>Part 6: Disclosing information in your tender</h1>
  </header><p>When you’re writing your tender, you’ll need to decide whether any information in it is commercially sensitive.</p>

<h2>Freedom of Information Act</h2>

<p>All contracts with public bodies are subject to the <a href="/make-a-freedom-of-information-request" title="make a Freedom of Information Act request">Freedom of Information Act</a>. </p>

<p>This means that information in your tender must be disclosed to anyone who asks for it, unless it’s exempt (for example, if it’s a <a rel="external" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-about/p-need/p-need-secret.htm" title="trade secrets">trade secret).</a> </p>

<p>Read about contract information that’s exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

</div>

<h2>Non-disclosure agreements</h2>

<p>You must say if any information in your tender is commercially confidential. If it is, then you might want to ask for a non-disclosure agreement.  </p>
