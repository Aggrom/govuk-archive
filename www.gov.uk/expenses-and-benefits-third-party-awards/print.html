  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations if your employees receive third-party awards.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>Third-party awards are normally incentives provided by someone other than you. For example, if you run a car dealership, your employee might receive an award from a car manufacturer.</p>

<p>Awards can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>cash</li>
  <li>vouchers</li>
  <li>cheques</li>
  <li>other gifts</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 2: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>What you have to report and pay depends on what kind of third-party award your employee receives, and whether you arrange the award.</p>

<h2>Cash and cash-exchangeable goods</h2>

<p>The third party must deduct <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax from the award and pay it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must deduct Class 1 National Insurance on the combined value of the award and the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax paid on it by the third party.</p>

<h2>Non-cash goods</h2>

<h3>If the third party arranges the award</h3>

<p>They must:</p>

<ul>
<li>account for the tax due on the award - this should be done by entering a Taxed Award Scheme (see the <a href="/third-party-awards-reporting-expenses-and-benefits/technical-guidance" title="technical guidance">technical guidance</a> at the end of this guide)</li>
  <li>pay any Class 1A National Insurance due on the value of the award and on the tax paid on it</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>In some instances Class 1 National Insurance will be due instead, eg if your employee’s personal bills are paid on their behalf. In this case you will need to deduct and pay them.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you arrange the award</h3>

<p>In this case:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tax due on the award must still be paid by the third party</li>
  <li>you must pay any Class 1A National Insurance that’s due</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 3: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><p>The value of the third-party award depends on what the award is.</p>

<h2>Cash</h2>

<p>The value to use is the amount of cash awarded, including the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax paid.</p>

<h2>Vouchers</h2>

<p>If the award consists of vouchers, then the value to use is the cost to the third party of providing the vouchers, including the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax paid.</p>

<h2>Other gifts</h2>

<p>If the award is something other than vouchers, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>for employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="earning rates">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 per year, the value to use is the second-hand value of the award</li>
  <li>for directors, and employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="earning rates">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more per year, the value to use is the cost to the third party of providing the award</li>
