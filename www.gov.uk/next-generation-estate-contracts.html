<h2 id="overview-of-changes-to-defence-estate-contracts">Overview of changes to defence estate contracts</h2>

<p>The defence estate plays a key role in supporting the Armed Forces as they prepare for operations by providing and maintaining infrastructure that meets military needs cost-effectively. From 2014 the current arrangements with industry to provide management, maintenance and development of the UK defence estate will expire.</p>

<p>The next generation estate contracts (<abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr>) programme is replacing those arrangements with a mix of prime contracts and capital works frameworks designed to deliver the best possible service for the Armed Forces and the rest of UK defence, and achieve best value for money for the UK taxpayer.</p>

<p>It is expected that the first framework will be awarded in summer 2013, the first prime contract will be awarded in early 2014 and be in-service by summer 2014.</p>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> is working closely with Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) customers and industry to identify best practice and build it into these future commercial arrangements and with wider government to reflect current and emerging policy in the development and procurement of the new contracts and framework arrangements.</p>

<p>The programme aims to involve companies from across industry, irrespective of size or geographical location, whether as potential supply chain partners or potential prime contractors.</p>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> is following EU guidelines in advertising commercial opportunities in the Official Journal of the European Union (<abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-being-delivered">What is being delivered?</h3>

<p>Following approval by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Investment Approvals Committee (<abbr title="Investment Approvals Committee">IAC</abbr>), the <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> team is developing and procuring a suite of new commercial arrangements that comprises:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 regional prime contracts delivering routine maintenance services:
    <ol>
<li>Scotland and Northern Ireland</li>
      <li>North of England, Wales, the Midlands and East Anglia </li>
      <li>South-west England</li>
      <li>South-east England</li>
    </ol>
</li>
  <li>one national and six regional capital works frameworks delivering construction projects, with the possibility of additional functional frameworks for single living accommodation (SLA) and airfield pavements </li>
  <li>a single UK-wide national housing prime contract delivering housing maintenance services across the UK </li>
  <li>a single UK-wide national training estate prime contract delivering range technical support, hard facilities management (hard <abbr title="Facilities Management">FM</abbr>), soft facilities management (soft <abbr title="Facilities Management">FM</abbr>), and training range booking services</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-being-replaced">What is being replaced?</h3>

<p>The current suite of estates contracts was let between 2003 and 2005, and comprises:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 UK mainland regional prime contracts (Scotland, south-west, south-east, central, east) delivering core works and routine maintenance work to existing facilities</li>
  <li>2 Northern Ireland regional contracts delivering routine maintenance work to existing facilities</li>
  <li>the housing prime contract delivering maintenance, improvements and full upgrades to military homes across England and Wales</li>
  <li>the Defence Training Estate (<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr>) contract delivering management of training areas, camps and ranges across the UK</li>
  <li>Project <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation Modernisation">SLAM</abbr> delivering new-build single living accommodation at defence establishments across the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>The future suite of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> contracts is estimated to be worth from £500 million to £600 million per year, and more than £5 billion over 10 years, exclusive of construction projects and work funded by <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> customers and subject to future financial planning rounds.</p>

<h2 id="future-energy-management">Future energy management</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is committed to reducing its energy consumption across its estate, to reduce financial overheads and carbon emissions, as well as to reduce its dependency on non-renewable energy sources and increase its usage of renewable energy.</p>

<p>Future <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> estate contractors and suppliers will play a key role in day-to-day energy management, and identifying and implementing measures to help the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to meet its aims and targets.</p>

<p>Central to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> energy management is a metered network, providing real-time data at site and building level, from smart meters. Approximately 80% of defence energy consumption is currently smart-metered.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has exceeded its cross-government sustainable operations on the government estate target to reduce carbon emissions by 12.5% by 2010/11 against 1999/2000 levels; it reached the target 2 years early and by 2009/10 had achieved a 19.4% reduction.</p>

<h3 id="dio-centralised-energy-management">
<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> centralised energy management</h3>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> it is planned that energy usage will be managed in a more central, co-ordinated way. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> will be responsible for managing demand across the entire defence estate, setting estate-wide strategy policy for advancing energy efficiency, auditing utility management and contractor performance, and providing assurance to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>), and HM Treasury.</p>

<h3 id="opportunities-database">Opportunities database</h3>

<p>Capturing and sharing best practice will be a vital feature of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> energy management. Where best practice is identified or developed, including spend-to-save proposals, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> will widen that knowledge across energy practitioners in <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and among its contractors via a database of projects and initiatives. This will enable staff in energy-related roles in <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and among its contractors, to search for and identify ideas and solutions.</p>

<h3 id="future-contractor-responsibilities">Future contractor responsibilities</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and its <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> team are working up detailed energy management requirements within the 4 future regional prime contracts (Scotland and Northern Ireland; north of England, Wales, the Midlands and East Anglia; south-west England; south-east England), under the following broad areas of responsibility:</p>

<h4 id="energy-management-bureau">Energy management bureau</h4>

<p>Each regional prime contractor will be required to set up a regional energy bureau, with responsibility for:</p>

<p>*monitoring and analysing site- and building-level smart metering data, and to work with the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to manage and rationalise energy consumption
* supplying regional data to a central <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> utilities office, collecting and interpreting data from main-gate meters and sub-meters in <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> establishments, and feeding into the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> central energy system
*analysing the relative energy performance of individual buildings, identifying and managing increases in consumption, and reporting on building energy use, carbon emissions and costs
* liaising with individual sites to identify and manage the issue, where building energy consumption is higher than expected</p>

<h4 id="surveys-and-auditing">Surveys and auditing</h4>

<p>At the start of the contract period, the prime contractor will be responsible for surveying all metering arrangements currently in place within the geographical area, and will required to identify and draw up business cases for whatever additional metering is required to ensure accurate and timely data that meets legislative standards.</p>

<p>Subsequently the contractor will be required to conduct annual surveys of the metering arrangements and data generated, to ensure that any changes to the size, usage or function of the estate are understood and accurately reflected.</p>

<p>Contractors will be required to use annual surveys to identify further opportunities for energy management and savings initiatives.</p>

<h4 id="spend-to-save-projects">Spend-to-save projects</h4>

<p>Prime contractors will be required to:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify potential ‘spend-to-save’ opportunities, such as overhauling existing <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> energy distribution networks, installing new heating and ventilation systems and insulation measures, running staff education and awareness programmes, and disposal of energy-inefficient buildings, as well as measures to manage infrastructure risks and ‘resilience’</li>
  <li>produce robust business cases for taking these opportunities forward, including prescriptive costs, benefits such as financial and carbon savings, and timeframes</li>
</ul>
<p>Spend-to-save measures will be recorded in the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> opportunities database, to ensure that best practice is captured and shared by other contractors and energy practitioners across the defence estate.</p>

<p>Each regional energy management bureau will be responsible for monitoring and reporting on the performance of spend-to-save projects.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is also considering mechanisms to enable future prime contractors to inject their own or other private capital into energy options and efficiency schemes, on behalf of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Finer detail on energy management plans and responsibilities under the future estate contracts will be available in due course.</p>

<h2 id="national-housing-prime---procurement">National housing prime - procurement</h2>

<p>Procurement of the national housing prime contract was launched in February 2011.</p>

<p>The national housing prime will provide repairs and maintenance to more than 49,000 UK military homes, grounds maintenance, and housing construction projects of an individual value of up to £3.93 million. Subject to further review it could potentially also provide occupancy management activities such as housing allocations, move-in move-out services, and the provision of furniture and fittings.</p>

<p>It is expected that the contract will be awarded by March 2014 and be in-service from November 2014. It will run for an initial 5 year period, with the option to extend it by a further 5 years. It is estimated to be worth up to £1.5 billion over 1- years, depending on which services are included and whether the contract is extended.</p>

<p>The new contract will replace the current housing contract for England and Wales and the separate arrangements for provision of housing in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The evaluation process had looked at the evidence of the bidders’ past performance which was submitted in the pre-qualification questionnaires (<abbr title="pre-qualification questionnaires">PQQs</abbr>). This included technical capability, health and safety, financial standing, quality assurance, environmental management and equal opportunity and diversity. </p>

<p>The 3 shortlisted bidders are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Carillion Holdings Ltd and Enterprise Managed Services Ltd</li>
  <li>Babcock Support Services Ltd</li>
  <li>Kier Ltd and Turner Facilities Management Ltd</li>
</ul>
<p>These bidders have been escorted on various housing site visits, and are now engaged in the ‘competitive dialogue’ and tendering process, which began in June 2012.</p>

<p>To assist businesses with an interest in potential supply chain opportunities, contact details for the shortlisted bidders will shortly be made available (subject to their individual approval) via the online <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> Potential Bidders Directory. </p>

<h2 id="national-training-estate-prime---procurement">National training estate prime - procurement</h2>

<p>The national training estate prime was launched on 28 July 2011. The contract is to manage approximately 200,000 hectares of UK training estate, including management of all training establishments, areas, camps and ranges, including air weapons ranges, in the UK, when the current arrangement expires in 2014. Key sites will include Salisbury Plain training area, Catterick training area, Dartmoor, Sennybridge, and Otterburn.</p>

<p>Services to be provided under the project will include management and operation of ranges and training areas, specialist range safety and range warden services, built estate facilities management, accommodation services, management of the rural estate, catering, cleaning, construction, range bookings and information management.</p>

<p>The contract is valued at between £450 million and £900 million over a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 10 years. It will replace the current contracts for the <abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr>. It is expected to be awarded by March 2014 and in service from September 2014.</p>

<h2 id="contract-principles">Contract principles</h2>

<p>In developing the future suite of contractual arrangements, the <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> team follows a number of principles to ensure it delivers an outcome that is accountable, equitable and efficient:</p>

<ul>
<li>value for money</li>
  <li>assurance </li>
  <li>engagement with <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> staff and customers </li>
  <li>engagement with industry, including <abbr title="small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> </li>
  <li>engagement with wider government and the public sector </li>
  <li>other principles </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="value-for-money">Value for money</h3>

<p>In the current fiscal climate it is essential that <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> can demonstrate that the future contracts will deliver the estate required by our Armed forces in the most cost-effective way; the tendering process will be used to ensure that successful bidders have the right culture of continuous improvement and value for money to be able to achieve this.</p>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> will introduce new measures to deliver value for money, including the use of mini-competitions for individual construction projects under the <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> Capital Works Frameworks, and fixed price schedules and service modules under the prime contracts.</p>

<h3 id="assurance">Assurance</h3>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> is following the principles of Office of Government Commerce (<abbr title="Office of Government Commerce">OGC</abbr>) Gateway™ process, and is running in 4 stages - initial gate business case, model research, model development, contract procurement and delivery - through to main gate approval. The programme is currently at the model development stage.</p>

<h3 id="engagement-with-dio-staff-and-customers">Engagement with <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> staff and customers</h3>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> is engaging with both <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> staff and customers to ensure lessons learnt from current commercial arrangements are built into the research and development of the new contracts, to meet future requirements.</p>

<p>During the initial research and model development stages, the <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> team ran workshops with <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> staff and customers, and it continues to provide briefings with key internal audiences. Regional roadshows will be run for staff affected by transition to the new arrangements.</p>

<h3 id="engagement-with-industry-including-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises">Engagement with industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises</h3>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> is engaging closely with industry, tapping into its expertise and knowledge and opening up the commercial opportunities to widest possible array of potential prime contractors, subcontractors and supply chain businesses, across the UK and within the EU, irrespective of size or specialisation.</p>

<p>Research into estate procurement practices has included consultation with Shell UK and National Grid plc and <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> has drawn on an earlier <abbr title="Defence Estate">DE</abbr> energy management study that was informed by organisations such as John Lewis, Sainsbury’s, M&amp;S, Morrisons, EDF Energy, BP and Gaz de France.</p>

<p>Seminars, conferences and workshops are being held to brief industry on progress and gather companies’ views and expertise via professional organisations such as Constructing Excellence, ADS Group, the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, the Business Services Association and the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Suppliers Association.</p>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> has held industry focus groups seeking industry best practice to inform contract development across: life-cycle replacement, sustainability and energy, defining the requirement, tender pricing structure, frameworks, pricing and incentivisation, assurance, minor new works, relationship management, estate management, and risk management to make the emerging themes and way forward available to all industry. </p>

<p>During the tendering process for the prime contracts, <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> is organising site visits for bidders to provide knowledge and affinity for customer requirements, and using competitive dialogue and negotiated processes to help them develop their tender solutions against the statement of requirement.</p>

<p>Local procurement and small and medium enterprises (<abbr title="small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>) - <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> aims to open the supply chain up to small and medium enterprises; the creation of regional core works frameworks should help towards that and <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> is working with industry to explore options for greater involvement of smaller and local businesses in regional prime contracts. </p>

<h3 id="engagement-with-wider-government-and-the-public-sector">Engagement with wider government and the public sector</h3>

<p><abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> has sought best practice from across wider government and the public sector, engaging organisations such as the <abbr title="Office of Government Commerce">OGC</abbr>, Highways Agency, Home Office, National Health Service, Hampshire County Council, British Airports Authority, Ministry of Justice, and the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>

<p>Engagement with wider government will continue during the model development stage, to ensure that the future contracts are sufficiently flexible potentially to absorb work injected from other government departments. The aim is to establish commercial arrangements compatible with current and planned contracts elsewhere in government and the public sector, to support the HM Treasury vision for cross-government procurement.</p>

<h3 id="other-principles">Other principles</h3>

<h4 id="strategic-defence-and-security-review-sdsr-and-future-force-2020">Strategic Defence and Security Review (<abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr>) and Future Force 2020</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> contracts are designed to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the emerging impact of wider change programmes on the future size and shape of the defence estate and the commercial activities required to maintain it.</p>

<h4 id="funding-flexibility">Funding flexibility</h4>

<p>The use of input and output specifications will enable <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> expenditure to be properly controlled and managed to ensure the new estate contracts are affordable within the current budget and sufficiently flexible to accommodate future fluctuations in defence spending.</p>

<h4 id="expertise">Expertise</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> team has been recruited from across <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and from the wider public sector and industry, and includes staff with a variety of professional qualifications, and experience of both the current <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> commercial arrangements and contracting arrangements within other organisations.</p>

<h2 id="progress-and-next-steps">Progress and next steps</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> programme aims to develop the optimum mix of future commercial arrangements for the defence estate, and to manage transition from the current commercial arrangements to the new suite of contracts.</p>

<p>From 2014 the current arrangements with industry to provide management, maintenance and development of the UK defence estate will expire. The <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> programme is replacing those arrangements with a mix of contracts that will deliver the best possible service for the Armed Forces and the rest of UK defence and achieves best value for money for the UK taxpayer.</p>

<h3 id="progress-to-date">Progress to date</h3>

<p>Since its inception the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> team has:</p>

<ul>
<li>reviewed the current arrangements and researched future contract model options by consulting a wide range of defence, wider government and industry stakeholders, drawing on best practice and lessons learnt</li>
  <li>analysed various contract option packages and obtained <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Investment Approvals Committee (<abbr title="Investment Approvals Committee">IAC</abbr>) approval for a preferred strategic way forward (announced in June 2010)</li>
  <li>run a series of industry focus groups to consult more than 60 private sector companies on key aspects of contract development</li>
  <li>invited expressions of interest (<abbr title="expressions of interest">EOIs</abbr>), held industry days, evaluated <abbr title="pre-qualification questionnaires">PQQs</abbr>, and announced shortlisted bidders for all prime contract and 2 capital works frameworks (east regional and national), and started the tendering process for some of these arrangements</li>
  <li>conducted a major programme review to deliver a revised procurement schedule that reflects the impact of various emerging factors, including the Strategic Defence and Security Review (<abbr title="Strategic Defence and Security Review">SDSR</abbr>), the creation of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> and the high degree of industry interest shown</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>

<p>Following the programme review, the <abbr title="Next Generation Estate Contracts">NGEC</abbr> team will now:</p>

<ol>
<li>develop plans for the procurement of the other regional capital works frameworks</li>
  <li>continue the tendering process through to invitations to submit final tenders, conduct ‘SmartSource’ tender evaluations, and submit a main gate business case for each contract and framework to the <abbr title="Investment Approvals Committee">IAC</abbr> for approval</li>
  <li>issue a Treasury Clearance Note for each prime contract for approval by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury</li>
  <li>award these contracts to successful bidders, with the current aim of achieving this in a phased approach from 2013 (capital works frameworks) and 2014 (prime contracts)</li>
  <li>manage the transition from ‘demobilisation’ of the current commercial arrangements to ‘mobilisation’ of the new suite of contracts and into a ‘steady state’ of operation</li>
</ol>
