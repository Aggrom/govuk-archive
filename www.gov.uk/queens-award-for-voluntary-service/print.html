  </header><p>The Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service is the highest award given to volunteer groups across the UK. </p>

<h2>Who is eligible</h2>

<p>Any group of 2 or more people doing volunteering work can be nominated for the award. The majority of the group must be volunteers, and more than half the volunteers must have the right to live in the UK.</p>

<p>To be nominated they should do work that:</p>

<ul>
<li>provides a service and meets a need for people living in the local community</li>
  <li>is supported, recognised and respected by the local community and the people who benefit from it</li>
  <li>is run locally</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Volunteer groups should have been running for three years or more to be nominated.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the winners get</h2>

<p>Winners get a certificate signed by the Queen and a domed glass crystal. Representatives from the group may also be invited to attend a royal garden party.</p>

<h2>How the winners are decided</h2>

<p>Local assessment panels look at all the nominations and decide which ones to send to the National Award Committee. </p>

<p>The committee makes recommendations to the Cabinet Office, which sends a final list to the Queen for her approval.</p>

<p>Winners are announced on June 2 every year.</p>

<h2>Support for your nomination</h2>

<p>When you nominate a group you also need letters from 2 people who support your nomination.</p>

<p>They can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a volunteer with the group</li>
  <li>someone who benefits from their work</li>
  <li>someone who is aware of their work</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the supporters falls into any of the above categories, the other must be completely independent of the group.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To make sure your group is considered for an award the year after you nominate them, submit your nomination by 30 September.</p>
