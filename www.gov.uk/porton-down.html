<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>It is now more than 90 years since the ‘experimental ground’ was set up at Porton Down to provide a proper scientific basis for the British use of chemical warfare, in response to the earlier German use of this means of war in 1915. </p>

<p>Work at Porton started in March 1916 and at the time only a few cottages and farm buildings were scattered on the Downs at Porton and Idmiston. Two years later this had become a large hutted camp with 50 officers and 1,100 other ranks. </p>

<p>The work mainly concerned the dissemination of chlorine and phosgene and, later, mustard gas. By May 1917 the focus for anti-gas defence and respirator development had moved from London to Porton Down.</p>

<p>After the Armistice, staff at Porton Down were reduced to a minimum level and in 1919 the War Office set up the Holland Committee to consider the future of chemical warfare and defence.</p>

<p>By 1920, the Cabinet agreed to the Committee’s recommendation that work should continue at Porton Down and from that date a slow permanent building programme began, coupled with the gradual recruitment of civilian scientists. By 1922, there were 380 servicemen, 23 scientific and technical civil servants and 25 ‘civilian subordinates’. By 1925 the civilian staff had doubled.</p>

<p>Since its establishment in 1916 Porton Down has undergone several changes of title and responsibility:</p>

<p>Between 1920 and the end of the World War 2, the main emphasis was on mustard gas and the multiplicity of problems attending both its use in war and the defence of the services from this potent agent.</p>

<p>By 1926 the chemical defence aspects of Air Raid Precautions (ARP) for the civilian population was added to the station’s responsibilities. By 1938, the international situation was such that offensive chemical warfare research and development and the production of war reserve stocks of chemical warfare agents by the chemical industry was authorised by the Cabinet. </p>

<p>Britain had ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol in 1930 with reservations which permitted the use of chemical warfare agents only in retaliation. The principle remained extant until 1955-1956, when Britain abandoned a programme to modernise its retaliatory capability. Since then, the residual stocks of agents were destroyed and work at Porton Down has been solely in assessment of the hazards of chemical warfare and in defensive requirements. </p>

<p>Chemical warfare was not used by any nation during World War 2 but as Allied armies penetrated Germany, operational stockpiles of munitions and weapons were discovered which contained new chemical warfare agents - the highly toxic organophosphorous nerve agents, unknown to Britain and the Allies.</p>

<p>The late 1940s and early 1950s saw research and development at Porton Down aimed at providing Britain with the means to arm itself with a modern nerve agent based capability and to develop specific means of defence against these agents. In the end these aims came to nothing on the offensive side because of the decision to abandon any sort of British chemical warfare capability.</p>

<p>On the defensive side there were years of difficult work to develop the means of prophylaxis, therapy, rapid detection and identification, decontamination and more effective protection of the body against nerve agents, capable of exerting effects through the skin, the eyes and respiratory tract.</p>

<p>In the 1950s the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment became involved with the development of CS, a riot control agent, and took an increasing role in trauma and wound ballistics work. Both these facets of Porton Down’s work had become more important because of the situation in Northern Ireland. In 1970 the Chemical Defence Establishment became the title of the senior establishment at Porton Down and remained for the next 21 years. Preoccupation with defence against the nerve agents continued but in the 1970s and 1980s there was concern about reported chemical warfare by Iraq against Iran and against its own Kurdish population.</p>

<p>Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 the problems increased, culminating in active operational support of British Forces in the Gulf region. After the Gulf ceasefire technical support has been provided for the UN Special Commission set up to oversee the destruction of the Iraqi capability to use nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. This continued until 1999 when Iraq withdrew co-operation from the Commission.</p>

<p>Throughout the past few decades there hase been technical support for the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, whose signatories have agreed to renounce and destroy all chemical warfare capabilities and to continue their interest solely in defensive research and development. In the 21st century the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is of considerable concern, as is terrorist use.</p>

<p>From 1940 Porton was also the centre of British interest in biological warfare and defence against it. Following the start of the World War 2 a highly secret and independent group was set up at Porton Down by the War Cabinet, with a mandate to investigate the reality of biological warfare by experiment and, if established, to develop a means of retaliation in kind in the event of the use of biological warfare against Britain and its Allies.</p>

<p>The group known as Biology Department, Porton, initially consisted of less than a dozen medics, scientists and technicians. The staff grew quickly but never exceeded about 50 people and included several American bacteriologists commissioned as Army and Navy officers. By 1946, the name of the wartime group had become the Microbiological Research Department. In 1951 the department had moved to a vast building adjacent to what had, by then, become the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment.</p>

<p>In 1957 the department became the Microbiological Research Establishment. By 1955 to 1956 research at both Porton Down establishments had become solely defensive and Britain abandoned moves to establish any offensive capabilities. Work continued on biological defence and an increasing amount of civil microbiological work. </p>

<p>By the 1970s it was decided that a reduced programme of biological defence work should be started by a small team transformed from the establishment to the Chemical Defence Establishment and that the Microbiological Research Establishment should be placed under the aegis of a civil authority.</p>

<p>The establishment closed as an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> facility on 31 March 1979 and re-opened the next day as the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (<abbr title="Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research">CAMR</abbr>) within the Public Health Laboratory Service (<abbr title="Public Health Laboratory Service">PHLS</abbr>). In April 1994, <abbr title="Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research">CAMR</abbr> moved from <abbr title="Public Health Laboratory Service">PHLS</abbr> centre to the Microbiological Research Authority (<abbr title="Microbiological Research Authority">MRA</abbr>), reporting to the Department of Health and still continuing the programme in civil microbiological research started in 1979.</p>

<p>Thus, by 1991 the Chemical Defence Establishment became the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment and was one of the six new Defence Support Agencies. In 1995, the establishment became part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (<abbr title="Defence Evaluation and Research Agency">DERA</abbr>), an executive agency of <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.</p>

<p>In 2001, <abbr title="Defence Evaluation and Research Agency">DERA</abbr> split into two organisations: QinetiQ, a private company, and <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory), which remains an agency of <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. Porton Down is now known as <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>, Porton Down.</p>

<p>NB:The above text is taken from the article ‘Porton Down: a brief history’ by G B Carter, Porton Down’s official historian. A more in-depth account can be found in Mr Carter’s book ‘Chemical and Biological at Porton Down 1916 to 2000’ (The Stationery Office, 2000).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-find-out-more-information-on-your-time-at-porton-down-and-examine-records">How to find out more information on your time at Porton Down and examine records</h3>

<p>Up to early 1998, Porton Down received a steady trickle of enquiries from ex-volunteers concerning the trials in which they had taken part, or the effect on their health. During this era responses gave outline details of studies in which people had been involved but did not make full use of the information available in the Porton archive. In response to continuing concern, in February 1998 the Minister for the Armed Forces agreed to establish the Porton Down Volunteer helpline. This regularised the existing arrangements for correspondence and established new principles of openness in dealing with individual ex-volunteers. </p>

<h3 id="porton-down-records">Porton Down records</h3>

<p>The Porton Down archive is often quite detailed, complex and technical although it is the case that historically, record keeping was not of the same quality as we would expect today. As far as can be determined, individual files were set up at Porton Down for each volunteer who came to the establishment. Many of the older files have since been destroyed although there are reasonably comprehensive records from 1942. For some volunteers, particularly in the period before 1942, the only record of their attendance at Porton Down is the laboratory notebooks of the time. </p>

<p>There might also be contributory information on the nature of the actual experiments in the subsequent technical reports that were produced, although these would not normally contain the names of individual volunteers. All these sources are comprehensively researched by expert staff in order to advise former volunteers of the details of the trials in which they took part. Any information found can be either shown personally to volunteers, or copies made available. </p>

<p>Regrettably, individuals may have to accept that in some cases the old records are sparse and that the record keeping of yesteryear may not be of the same high standards expected today. </p>

<h3 id="service-medical-records">Service medical records</h3>

<p>Every individual serviceman or woman had, or has, a Service Medical Record. Prior to the late 1980s, the records of those attending Porton Down to take part in experiments were usually only marked to show that attendance had taken place and would not have included details of the trials which the volunteer took part in. In some cases, even attendance was not recorded. Anyone wishing to see their Service Medical Record should write to one of the addresses shown below.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-you-do-now">What should you do now?</h3>

<p>If you wish to find out what experiments you were involved in at Porton Down you should either contact the Porton Down Volunteer helpline (0800 783 2521) or write to Porton Down at the address given.</p>

<p>They will need to know your full name, service number and, if possible, the dates, or at least the approximate time, that you came to Porton Down. Staff will then write back to you with a summary of the records that they have been able to find. If you wish to follow up your enquiry Porton Down can arrange for you to visit the establishment, accompanied by a friend, family member, legal adviser or other supporter, to view details of your own records. You will also have the opportunity, if you wish, to discuss the nature of the experiments in which you were involved with one of Porton Down’s scientific experts. </p>

<h3 id="data-protection-act">Data Protection Act</h3>

<p>On 24 October 2001 the Data Protection Act came into force. In order to comply with the requirements of this Act staff at Porton Down will require you to complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-defence-data-protection-act-subject-access-request-form">form</a> to request details of your attendance as part of the Service Volunteer Programme and to provide proof of identification: this can be in the form of a passport, driving licence, birth certificate or utility bill. A photocopy of any of these will be sufficient but if you forward an original it will be returned to you. This can be printed off, completed and sent (along with proof of identification) to DSTL.</p>
