Recycling waste means creating new products from materials which have been thrown away.\r\n\r\nAccreditation is a voluntary process but will allow your business to receive payments from registered producers for issuing electronic packaging waste recovery notes (ePRNs) and electronic packaging waste export recovery notes (ePERNs).\r\n\r\n##How to apply\r\n\r\nYou can apply for accreditation online using the [National Packaging Waste Database (NPWD).](http://npwd.environment-agency.gov.uk/ \"National Packaging Waste Database\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\nAccreditations last for a maximum of one year and run from January to December. You must apply by 30 September if you want your accreditation to start from 1 January of the following year.\r\n\r\nBefore granting accreditation, an environmental officer may contact you to arrange a site visit.\r\n\r\nYour regulator will notify you whether your application was successful within 12 weeks of submission.\r\n\r\nOnce you are accredited you can use the NPWD to:\r\n\r\n* record the waste packaging you have received for reprocessing or export\r\n* fill in your three-monthly returns for waste packaging you have reprocessed or exported\r\n* issue ePRNs and/or ePERNs\r\n\r\nIf you are reprocessing or exporting iron, steel or aluminium packaging, you must check whether your supplier is accredited and, if so, whether they have issued ePRNs on the loads they are sending to you - ie to prevent issuing a second ePRN for the same metal waste packaging.\r\n\r\nWhen renewing your accreditation, you should revise your business plan to reflect your strategy for the new accreditation period.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to comply with any accreditation conditions (eg supplying records and reports) your accreditation may be suspended or cancelled.\r\n\r\n*[NPWD]: National Packaging Waste Database\r\n*[SEPA]: Scottish Environment Protection Agency\r\n*[ePRNs]: electronic packaging waste recovery notes \r\n*[ePRN]: electronic packaging waste recovery note\r\n*[ePERNs]: electronic packaging waste export recovery notes\r\n","licence_short_description":"Register for waste packaging reprocessor accreditation if you recover, recycle or exporting packaging waste for recovery overseas.","overview":"You can apply for the waste packaging reprocessor registration if you recover, recycle or exporting packaging waste for recovery overseas","slug":"waste-packaging-reprocessor-accreditation-england-wales-scotland","title":"Waste packaging reprocessor accreditation (England, Wales and Scotland)","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:14:44+00:00","will_continue_on":"","type":"licence"}
