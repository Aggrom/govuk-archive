</header><article id="importing-and-exporting-food"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><h2>Importing food</h2>

<p>Most food and drink products imported from the EU have no restrictions.</p>

<p>Most <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports" title="Food Standards Agency - Imported food">regulations are for food and drink</a> that are imported from countries outside the EU. In this case you may need:</p>

<ul>
<li>health certificates</li>
  <li>import licences</li>
</ul>
<p>You must follow general export regulations.</p>

<h2>Exporting food</h2>

<p>You will have to research the food safety regulations in the countries you choose to export food to. Regulations can be different to those in the UK.</p>

<p>You can find information about the country you want to export to from:</p>

<ul>
<li>your local UK Trade and Investment Trade Team</li>
  <li>food and drink trade associations</li>
  <li>your local chamber of commerce</li>
</ul>
<p>You must follow general export regulations.</p>

</article><article id="organic-produce"><header><h1>Part 2: Organic produce</h1>
  </header><p>How you import organic food depends on which country you are importing it from.</p>

<h2>Imports from the EU</h2>

<p>You can import organic produce from the EU as long as your supplier is registered with an EU organic certification body. </p>

</div>

<p>An organic certification body is an independent organisation that has standards for its members that meet or exceed government regulations.</p>

<h2>Imports from outside the EU</h2>

<p>You can import certain organic products from countries that are covered under ‘equivalence agreements’ -  this means they have no import restrictions.</p>

<p>The countries that have equivalence agreements with the UK are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Argentina</li>
  <li>Australia</li>
  <li>Costa Rica</li>
  <li>India</li>
  <li>Israel</li>
  <li>Japan</li>
  <li>New Zealand</li>
  <li>Switzerland</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all products will be covered by equivalence agreements. Call the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) helpline if you are unsure whether a product is covered by an agreement.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> Helpline</strong>  </p>

<p>For countries not covered by equivalence agreements, you must: </p>

  <li>be registered with an EU Organic Certification Body </li>
  <li>have a Certificate of Inspection for the food you want to import</li>
</ul></article><article id="genetically-modified-foods"><header><h1>Part 3: Genetically Modified foods</h1>
  </header><p>Genetically Modified (<abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr>) foods are not grown commercially in the UK. The <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> foods you can import are varieties of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>oilseed rape</li>
  <li>soybean</li>
  <li>cotton</li>
  <li>maize</li>
  <li>sugar beet</li>
</ul>
<p>You can search for authorised <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> foods on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/dyna/gm_register/index_en.cfm/" title="EU register of authorised GMOs">European Commission website.</a></p>

<p>There is detailed guidance on labelling and other issues relating to <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> foods from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/gm/" title="GM Foods">Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>).</a></p>


</article><article id="food-import-controls"><header><h1>Part 4: Food import controls</h1>
  </header><p>Certain foods are considered high risk and harmful to public health, eg if they cause illness. There are special rules and certificates that you may need to reduce this risk to public health when importing these goods.  </p>

<p>As the foods that are considered harmful can change, you need to find out what the current import controls are from the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>).</p>
