<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>All businesses must keep and preserve certain records and accounts and be able to present these upon request to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). If you’re VAT registered you must keep records and accounts and/or if you’re importing or exporting you must declare any goods you move and keep appropriate records. Although a lot of trade is carried out electronically it’s still important to have an efficient system of record-keeping and to know how long to store documents.</p>

<p>This guide provides information about how long <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and other government agencies expect you to keep VAT records and key import and export documents. It provides guidance on data protection and best practice for archiving trade documents. It also explains what penalties apply for regulatory non-compliance and how to appeal against them. </p>

<h2 id="best-practice-when-archiving-your-international-trade-documents">Best practice when archiving your international trade documents</h2>

<p>It’s vital that you have a robust system for keeping business records. This will help you comply with international trade regulations and allow <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to carry out audits effectively. Your records must be: </p>

<ul>
<li>accurate and up to date</li>
  <li>legible</li>
  <li>readily accessible whether held on paper, computer, microfiche or microfilm</li>
  <li>available for inspection at all reasonable times</li>
</ul>
<p>The archiving period for your records will vary according to the individual procedure. However, in the event of a criminal investigation, traders’ records dating back ten years may be used as evidence. Accordingly you may decide to retain documents for that length of time. After the date of entry you can keep your records on a computer.</p>

<p>In the case of procedures, be sure to:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a facility to download data for any off-site checks or audit work that <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> officers might need to carry out</li>
  <li>maintain adequate back up and disaster recovery systems</li>
  <li>include the computer system in your annual audit</li>
  <li>give advance notice to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> of any proposed operating system changes</li>
</ul>
<p>If your record-keeping is causing storage problems or undue expense, get in touch with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s National Advice Service. They may allow you to reduce the length of time for storing documents. </p>

<h3 id="management-support-system">Management Support System</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can provide assistance in your record-keeping through <abbr title="Management Support System">MSS</abbr>. This provides import and export data collected on the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system - <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s computerised system for processing import and export declarations. You can find out about the <abbr title="Management Support System">MSS</abbr> in the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/chief-trader-import-and-export-processing-system">UK’s import and export processing system <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Under an agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, <abbr title="Management Support System">MSS</abbr> data can be purchased by subscribers in spreadsheet form. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_001363&amp;propertyType=document">find a copy of the <abbr title="Management Support System">MSS</abbr> Agreement form on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Four types of reports are produced:</p>

<ul>
<li>import item</li>
  <li>import entry</li>
  <li>import tax lines</li>
  <li>export item</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use data supplied directly from <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> records for checks on information provided by your agent. If you’re separately tracking your customs declarations it’ll also fill in any gaps in your records.</p>

<p>Annual reports cost £204 plus VAT, while customised reports for the same period cost £360 plus VAT. If you wish to request a regular monthly report, you will have to sign up for a minimum period of 12 months. It may be possible to request a report for less than a period of 12 months, but this will be treated as a ‘one-off’ request.</p>

<h3 id="outsourced-providers">Outsourced providers</h3>

<p>You may decide to transfer your archived documents to a third-party provider. A typical storage specialist might offer the following off-site services:</p>

<ul>
<li>state-of-the-art security</li>
  <li>document retrieval</li>
  <li>cataloguing</li>
  <li>document viewing room</li>
  <li>secure shredding of unwanted archive documents</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of storage depends on the provider. If you’re a member of a chamber of commerce or trade association they may be able to help you find local storage services. Otherwise you can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Advice Service.</p>

<h2 id="data-protection-and-archiving-your-international-trade-documents">Data protection and archiving your international trade documents</h2>

<p>If you keep archived trade documents on your premises you should make every effort to secure them. Your premises should always be locked when not in use and you could consider additional locking of cabinets and storage rooms.</p>

<p>Assurance officers from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may request that you take steps to meet required security standards. You may have to:    </p>

<ul>
<li>either have a terminal for official use only or set up a password-entry system for officers to access files on a read-only basis</li>
  <li>keep a record of any changes in software you use</li>
  <li>ensure no unauthorised access to data can take place</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="combating-hackers">Combating hackers</h3>

<p>If your business has a website or staff intranet you should take precautions against hackers. Hackers can obtain confidential information straight from your network or commit electronic vandalism. The following will help protect your data from attack:</p>

<ul>
<li>a firewall</li>
  <li>user authentication</li>
  <li>message encryption</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="information-about-your-business-held-by-trade-authorities">Information about your business held by trade authorities</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> collects information about your business for duty and tax purposes and to enforce import and export legislation. It carries out inspections to check the accuracy of returns against declarations made. It may pass information about your records to other government departments, such as the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills.
 
Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li>know if information about you or your business is held on a computer</li>
  <li>be supplied with a copy of that information</li>
  <li>have inaccurate data erased or corrected</li>
  <li>receive compensation if your business is damaged due to inaccurate data or loss or disclosure of personal data</li>
</ul>
<p>If you import or export animals or food products, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) may collect information about your business for statistical reasons. You can ask them to release this information under either the Environmental Information Regulations or the Freedom of Information Act. </p>

<h2 id="archiving-documents-relating-to-customs-procedures">Archiving documents relating to customs procedures</h2>

<p>If you’re trading internationally, you must comply with import and export legislation. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> frontier officers are responsible for enforcing these laws and you will need the right paperwork before goods can be cleared. Records need to be kept for all procedures including warehousing, Inward Processing Relief, Free Zones and Simplified Procedures and all duties and taxes including VAT and customs and excise duties. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> documents, licences and certificates (such as those arising from Common Agriculture Policy, Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors, preference and proof of origin, and Common Veterinary Entry Documents) also need to be kept on file.</p>

<p>If you take advantage of simplified customs procedures you’ll need to retain these documents, so that <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can carry out an audit of your business. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> carry out audits to check you have paid the correct duty and VAT on your trading activities.</p>

<h3 id="free-zones-and-custom-warehousing">Free Zones and custom warehousing</h3>

<p>Goods imported to a Free Zone or to a customs-approved warehouse may delay the payment of customs duty and import VAT. They’re declared to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in the normal way - submitting an electronic declaration to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> based on the format of the Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) - however, there are specific record-keeping requirements. Your records should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>information in <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> for the declaration of entry including the entry number to the arrangements</li>
  <li>commercial or technical descriptions necessary to identify the goods</li>
  <li>the dates on which the goods were entered and discharged from the arrangement</li>
  <li>details of any processing or temporary use of the goods</li>
  <li>location of the goods for monitoring purposes, including details of any transfers</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find that goods are missing you must notify <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> of any discrepancy between your stock records and the tally of physical goods.</p>

<p>You must keep your stock records for at least four years after the goods have been removed from the Free Zone or customs warehousing arrangements.</p>

<h3 id="import-and-export-licences">Import and export licences</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> enforces controls on some imports and exports. You can find out about more about licences in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/getting-the-right-licences-for-international-trading">Licences and enforcement for international trading</a>.</p>

<h2 id="archiving-your-international-trade-declarations">Archiving your international trade declarations</h2>

<p>You’re required to keep records for all traded goods you declare to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> for four years.</p>

<h3 id="import-declarations">Import declarations</h3>

<p>These are made using the electronic <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system.</p>

<p>For archiving purposes you may choose to print screenshots of documents held on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and keep paper records. Alternatively, you can access declaration data through <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Management Support System (<abbr title="Management Support System">MSS</abbr>). This application archives reference data used to process <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> declarations, and provides a variety of query and report options.</p>

<p>For an overview of the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/chief-trader-import-and-export-processing-system">UK’s import and export processing system <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr></a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> is also used when valuing imported goods. Valuations are needed so that <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can calculate the amount of customs duty and import VAT payable. Higher value goods also require a valuation declaration form and if you regularly import from the same supplier under the same terms you can use one of these to apply for a General Valuation Statement.</p>

<h3 id="goods-imported-under-preferential-arrangements">Goods imported under preferential arrangements</h3>

<p>You can import goods from some non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries with a reduced or zero rate of import duty. To qualify you’ll need a valid preference document from the vendor showing proof of origin, usually either an EUR1 or ATR form. Documents must be kept four years - unless there is a criminal investigation in which case the ten-year rule applies.</p>

<h3 id="export-declarations">Export declarations</h3>

<p>These are carried out using the National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>). This is an electronic system which allows traders to lodge a declaration either inland or at the frontier. In the case of exports made via another member state of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> provides an electronic alternative to a paper <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> as evidence of export when making a claim for zero-rating of VAT. It also provides official export evidence for direct exports.</p>

<p>You should keep hold of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> as proof of export or import for at least four years for customs export purposes, unless subject to criminal investigation, in which case the ten-year rule applies. You will also need to retain all commercial invoices and valuation forms.</p>

<p>When keeping electronic records it’s sensible either to make page printouts or take screenshots. However, you may prefer to use the <abbr title="Management Support System">MSS</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="intrastat-supplementary-declarations">Intrastat Supplementary Declarations</h3>

<p>If you have trading activity within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> that exceeds a certain threshold you must complete an Intrastat Supplementary Declaration (<abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>). You must make a copy of each <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> as part of your record-keeping responsibilities and keep them along with any relevant commercial documents for six years. Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/supplementary-declarations-for-intrastat">Supplementary Declarations for Intrastat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="archiving-your-international-trade-relief-documents">Archiving your international trade relief documents</h2>

<p>There are a number of schemes under which you can claim relief on customs duty paid on imports: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/temporary-admission">Temporary admission,</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inward-processing">Inward Processing,</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/end-use-relief">End-Use relief,</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/outward-processing-relief-opr">Outward Processing Relief</a>. The documentation required to ensure a reduced rate of duty, or no duty at all, changes according to the scheme. However, the record-keeping responsibilities are similar. If you are authorised to use one or more of the customs duty reliefs, you should keep commercial documents from your transactions for at least four years in order to show:</p>

<ul>
<li>what the goods are</li>
  <li>relevant timescales, eg when entered to the procedure</li>
  <li>evidence that the goods qualify for duty relief</li>
  <li>details of any processing carried out </li>
  <li>cross-referencing with invoices for your imports and exports</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="electronic-records">Electronic records</h3>

<p>You’re free to keep these records on a computer, but you must advise <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if you plan to do so and seek their advice on how to store your electronic records properly. This can be complex in instances where agents and third parties are employed or where a company has more than one premises. They’ll need to ensure your system meets their technical requirements and may ask for your assistance when making any checks.</p>

<p>You should be able to provide the following documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li>user guide</li>
  <li>system/program specification</li>
  <li>database management documentation</li>
  <li>file layouts</li>
  <li>data dictionary</li>
  <li>schemas and sub-schemas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="archiving-your-vat-and-excise-documents">Archiving your VAT and Excise documents</h2>

<p>VAT is payable on most imports to the UK. If your business exceeds a certain VAT threshold you must be VAT-registered and store records and accounts of all taxable goods or services you receive or supply. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration/newbusiness/introduction">Register your business for VAT with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr></a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You should keep your VAT records for at least six years and maintain a VAT account and certain records. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> inspectors may visit your business premises to validate your VAT returns, so you should ensure your system makes it easy for them to check the figures you have used to complete your returns.</p>

<h3 id="excise-documents">Excise documents</h3>

<p>You should keep all business records concerning excise goods for at least six years, because <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will occasionally carry out inspections of your business. Your excise records should cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>stock</li>
  <li>handling</li>
  <li>purchases</li>
  <li>sales</li>
  <li>imports</li>
  <li>dispatches and exports</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can also examine trading statements, management accounts and other business records.</p>

<p>Excise traders should also keep an excise duty account. This is a permanent record, in summary format, of all the excise duty payable in each duty accounting period.</p>

<h2 id="archiving-your-international-trade-veterinary-and-food-documents">Archiving your international trade veterinary and food documents</h2>

<p>There are controls on UK imports of live animals intended for human consumption and meat, fish and dairy products - products of animal origin (<abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>). You can find out about <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> in the guide to trading in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/animal-products-import-and-export">products of animal origin</a>. You must notify the port health authorities if you’re importing <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> or Animal Health if you’re importing live animals so that veterinary checks can take place. As well as the transportation paperwork, you must present the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Common Veterinary Entry Document (<abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>)</li>
  <li>health certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>If your goods are validated, the veterinary (or fish) inspector at the border will keep the original health certificate and give you an authenticated copy, which you should keep at your business premises for at least one year. You’ll also be given a completed <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>, which you should keep for at least one year.</p>

<p>You’ll need a health certificate for most animal and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> exports. An official veterinarian will sign and stamp the original certificate. You should keep a copy for two years.</p>

<p>Some live animals and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> exports require an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate if they’re being transported to another member state. You should keep this document for at least three years.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export/">find the latest news and other information on the import and export of animals and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the rules for importing animal by-products - with appropriate documentation requirements - are being phased in between March 2011 and January 2012. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/dealing-with-animal-by-products">dealing with animal by-products</a>.</p>

<h3 id="organic-and-plant-products">Organic and plant products</h3>

<p>To import organic food products, you need authorisation from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. To apply you must pay a fee of £27 and complete an OB 11 application form. Authorisation lasts for one year, after which time it’ll need to be renewed. For details, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/organic-produce-how-to-become-an-importer">Organic produce: how to become an importer</a>.</p>

<p>Individual organic consignments also require a separate certificate - the Certificate of Inspection for Organic Products - from the relevant control body in the third (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) country. You must keep this for at least two years after it’s been endorsed. </p>

<p>For some imported plant products a phytosanitary certificate is required. You must keep a copy of this at your business premises for at least two years. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/imports/licensing.cfm">find out about importing, moving and keeping prohibited material including plants information on the Food and Environment Research Agency (<abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fruit-and-vegetables">Fruit and vegetables</h3>

<p>If you’re importing fresh fruit, vegetables, salad crops or nuts you may need to apply for a Certificate of Conformity using <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates (<abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>) system. Whether or not you need a certificate will depend on a number of factors. These include the type of produce, the marketing standards that apply to that produce, and whether it is intended for eating or processing. Where a Certificate of Conformity is required, you should keep this for at least three years. Note that <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> keeps records of your outstanding applications and provides access to inspection data used for risk assessment. You can <a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/">register to use <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="archiving-your-international-trade-commercial-and-transport-documents">Archiving your international trade commercial and transport documents</h2>

<p>Your record-keeping responsibilities as an international trader include keeping a number of commercial and transport documents on file. These documents are partly for your own benefit, for example, when making claims under warranty. But they also form an important part of your VAT records so you should keep them for at least six years. </p>

<h3 id="sales-records">Sales records</h3>

<p>Sales and purchase records must be kept so that <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> inspectors can check that VAT-registered businesses have paid the correct VAT on traded goods. These records should include annual accounts, cash books, orders and delivery notes, credit and debit notes, purchase invoices and copy sales invoices and any relevant correspondence.</p>

<p>There are different ways of keeping records to suit your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>cash accounting scheme - this operates on the basis of payments received and made, rather than invoices issued and received. It is for businesses with a turnover of less than £600,000.</li>
  <li>retail scheme - under this scheme you don’t have to issue invoices unless asked. It is aimed at businesses that sell direct to the public.</li>
  <li>second-hand scheme - for businesses selling second-hand or antique goods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transport-documents">Transport documents</h3>

<p>You should also keep records of transport documents, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>shipping orders - containing cargo details and the shipper’s requirements</li>
  <li>bills of lading - documents of title providing evidence of the contract between exporter and carrier</li>
  <li>air/sea waybills - similar to a bill of lading, but not a title document</li>
  <li>consignment note - acknowledgment by road or rail transport carrier of goods being transported </li>
</ul>
<p>These documents can be useful as further evidence of transactions should they ever be brought into question. Additionally, a combination or all of the following may provide suitable evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>inter-company correspondence</li>
  <li>the customer’s order documentation</li>
  <li>payment details</li>
  <li>sales invoices</li>
  <li>advice notes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="penalty-regimes-and-archiving-your-international-trade-documents">Penalty regimes and archiving your international trade documents</h2>

<p>Inland assurance officers from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> have the right to examine any records that you keep for the purpose of your business. This includes stock and inventory information as well as financial and audit documents. Officers need access to this information to verify claims and declarations you have made.</p>

<p>As well as being accurate and up to date it’s important the information you have is easily accessible to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> officers. VAT-registered businesses should have a summary of VAT for each accounting period covered by your VAT returns. Any data held on a computer system should have an audit trail - this means keeping a log of any amendments in the system.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> is aware that one-off mistakes are often genuine errors and not evidence of deliberate wrong-doing. However, if its officers suspect you’re hiding information that should be included in your VAT records they may secretly observe your business for up to a year before or after visiting you.</p>

<p>Although record-keeping is your responsibility you should be aware that if you use an agent or freight forwarder you’re liable for any incorrect information they provide to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="civil-penalties">Civil penalties</h3>

<p>Fraudulent declarations and dishonest claims for repayment of duty or relief from duty are likely to be met with civil evasion penalties. So too will repeated examples of poor record-keeping. Financial penalties are imposed under the Finance Act 2003. The size of the penalty is influenced by the level of co-operation given to investigating officers. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageTravel_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_MIG_009852#P42_3927%20">find the statement of practice on civil evasion penalty investigations on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Other civil penalties may be imposed under the Customs Regulations 2003 and Exports Regulations 2003. These range between £1,000 and £2,500 and will only be charged after a warning letter has been issued.</p>

<p>False declarations are also punishable under the Customs &amp; Excise Management Act 1979. This gives <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> powers to seize goods, which won’t be released until a penalty fee is met and the duty or VAT payable is paid in full.</p>

<h3 id="criminal-penalties">Criminal penalties</h3>

<p>In exceptional cases <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will pursue sanctions through the criminal courts.</p>

<h3 id="appeals">Appeals</h3>

<p>If you want to appeal against the issue of a warning letter or civil penalty you must do so within 45 days. Write to your local <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> office and ask for a departmental review of the decision.</p>

<p>If your appeal is unsuccessful you can take matters further at an independent VAT and Duties Tribunal.</p>
