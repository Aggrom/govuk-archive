  </header><p>If you drive a vehicle on the road you must keep it in a roadworthy condition. The MOT test checks that your vehicle meets road safety and environmental standards.    </p>

<p>You must get an MOT test every year once your vehicle is 3 years old, or 1 year for a Heavy Goods Vehicle (<abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle">HGV</abbr>). You can then renew your MOT up to a month before it expires. The earliest date you can get your vehicle tested is printed on the pass certificate.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>To get your MOT you need to book an appointment with an MOT test centre. Only approved centres showing the blue sign with 3 white triangles can carry out your MOT.</p>

<h2>The MOT certificate</h2>

<p>The MOT certificate confirms that <strong>at the time of the test</strong> your vehicle meets the minimum legal road safety and environmental standards. It doesn’t mean that the vehicle is roadworthy for the length of time the certificate is valid.</p>

<p>The MOT certificate also doesn’t check the general mechanical condition of your vehicle and doesn’t cover the condition of the:</p>

</article><article id="mot-text-reminder-service"><header><h1>Part 5: MOT text reminder service</h1>
  </header><p>If you register for the MOT text reminder service you’ll get messages telling you when your MOT is due.</p>

<h2>How the service works</h2>

<p>Once you’re registered you’ll get 3 text reminders to your mobile phone to remind you of your MOT date. </p>

<p>They’ll be sent:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 weeks before</li>
  <li>2 weeks before</li>
  <li>the day before</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get a 4th message once the vehicle’s passed its MOT to remind you to register again for the next MOT test reminder.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your registration can’t be transferred to another vehicle or different mobile phone number.</p>
</div>

<h2>How much it costs</h2>

<p>There’s a one-off charge of <strong>£1.50</strong>, which is collected through your mobile phone network provider once your registration is accepted.</p>

<h2>What you need to use this service</h2>

<p>You’ll need a:</p>

<ul>
<li>UK registered mobile phone</li>
  <li>UK registered vehicle</li>
  <li>the vehicle’s latest MOT test number</li>
  <li>to be able to incur charges on the mobile phone or have the bill payer’s permission</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Check you’ve got enough credit if you’re using a pay-as-you-go phone phone and make sure there is room in your text message inbox for new messages.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to register</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Text your MOT test number to <strong>66848 (MOT4U)</strong> from your mobile phone.</p>
</div>

<p>The MOT test number has 12 digits and is in the top left corner of your MOT test certificate (VT20).</p>

<p>You’ll then be sent a free message to say if you’ve registered successfully or not. If the information you send doesn’t match with the vehicle record, or payment can’t be taken (for example, if you’ve not got enough credit on your phone) then you won’t be able to register and you won’t be charged.  </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can register as many vehicles as you want on the same phone, or register the same vehicle on different phones for £1.50 each time.</p>
</div>

<h2>How long your registration lasts</h2>

<p>Your registration will last for up to 13 months, and once your vehicle passes a MOT test or the due date for your MOT test passes, you’ll stop getting reminder messages.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>When your vehicle passes its MOT test you will need to register and pay again for the service.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cancelling your registration</h2>

<p>You can cancel your registration at any time by sending a STOP text message to <strong>66848 (MOT4U)</strong>.</p>
