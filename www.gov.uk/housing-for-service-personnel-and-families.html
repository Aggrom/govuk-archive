<h3 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h3>
<p>The system councils use to assess applications for housing is often referred to as the ‘Allocations Scheme’ or ‘Housing Register’.  You can apply to join a Councils Housing Register even if you do not live in that area, however some Councils give a higher priority who already live in the area.  Procedures and allocation policies vary from one area to another, but all councils have to follow certain rules. They must consider every application individually based on the merits and as long as you have followed the application procedure correctly.  </p>

<p>You need to apply to the council and get on the Housing Register as soon as possible, even if you have a number of years left to serve as time spent on the register may help you.  Follow the links on our website to your chosen council. You are also able to apply for housing whilst serving at a BFPO address.  You are not however, eligible to apply for shared ownership if you are not a resident within the UK.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h3>

<p>On receipt of your application, your council will acknowledge it and your needs will be assessed in accordance with the council’s points scheme. These point schemes vary from district to district but details are readily available on request.</p>

<p>If you have special health or care needs, these will be assessed and taken into account in the priority given to your application. This may involve the council liaising with social services to ensure that your specific needs are catered for, if at all possible.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-will-i-have-to-wait">How long will I have to wait?</h3>

<p>Different areas vary in popularity and in the availability of the type of housing you may be looking for. The council will evaluate your needs from your application form and you will be advised of the number of points your application has been given. You will then be told how long you can expect to wait before you are re-housed by the council if at all.</p>

<p>Once your application reaches the top of the list, you will be offered the next appropriate dwelling in your area of choice. You will have a set number of days to decide whether you want to accept the offer. If you refuse the offer, you may be offered further accommodation later, but policies vary from council to council so check before you refuse.  Most councils have a limited number of properties and demand currently exceeds supply. Therefore, only those in the greatest need are likely to be assisted.</p>

<p>If you are a foreign and commonwealth Service person you maybe ineligible to apply for social housing until you have started the process to apply for your Indefinite Leave to Remain (<abbr title="Indefinite Leave to Remain">ILR</abbr>) or UK Citizenship.</p>

<p>The following affordable housing schemes are available to the Service/Ex Service community. Service personnel have now been given Priority Status to assist them in gaining access to Affordable Housing Schemes across all English regions and the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.</p>

<h3 id="the-homebuy-scheme-and-mortgage-rescue">The Homebuy Scheme and Mortgage Rescue</h3>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.homebuy.co.uk/" title="Homebuy housing scheme website">HomeBuy</a> enables social tenants, Ministry of Defence Personnel and other first time buyers to buy a share of a home and get a first step on the housing ladder in England.</p>

<p>There are a number of HomeBuy products, provided by the Homes and Community Agency, based on shared ownership and equity loan products offering people a choice in the type of home they can buy.</p>

<p>This section gives details for each of the products, provides answers to the most common questions about the scheme and lists contact details for the HomeBuy agents who provide a contact point for affordable housing options in different areas of England.

<h3 id="mod-referral-scheme-formally-known-as-the-mod-nominations-scheme">
<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Referral Scheme, formally known as the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Nominations Scheme</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has established a referral scheme with Housing Associations to provide low-cost, rented accommodation for people coming out of the Services. The Scheme, which was originally based on the sale of surplus family quarters, operates in about 180 locations in England, Scotland and Wales. The Scheme is open to single and married Service leavers in their last six months of Service and to separated spouses who are under notice from Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) in Service Families accommodation. Local connections to the area for which you are applying are not required.</p>

<h2 id="housing-associations">Housing associations</h2>

<p>Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) commonly known as Housing Associations offer property for social rent and are the main providers of new social housing through Shared Ownership schemes. There are over 1,800 RSLs in England, currently managing around 1.7 million homes and housing at least twice that many people.</p>

<p>Registered Social Landlord is the technical name for a social landlord who is registered with the Tenant Services Authority: most are housing associations, but there are also trusts, co-operatives and companies. RSLs are run as businesses but they do not trade for profit. Any surplus is ploughed back into the organisation to maintain existing homes and to help finance new ones.</p>

<p>Most RSLs are small and own fewer than 250 homes. However, the largest 13% of RSLs - those with 2,500 plus homes - own over 80% of all the sector’s homes. Many new RSLs have been formed to manage and develop homes transferred to them by local authorities.</p>

<p>Communities and Local Government sponsors the Tenant Services Authority and the Homes and Communities Agency to invest public money in RSLs and protects that investment by ensuring that it provides decent homes and services for residents. RSLs receive investment to provide homes that meet local needs. Through regulation the Tenant Services Authority seeks to ensure that people will want, and be able, to live in these homes, now and in the future.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-become-a-rsl-tenant-or-get-help-with-home-ownership">How to become a RSL tenant or get help with home ownership</h3>

<p>Generally, people housed by RSLs are those defined as being in ‘housing need’ but eligibility criteria differ. Some RSLs, for instance, specialise in providing housing for those who need special support such as people with mental illness or drug problems. All housing associations must have written policies on the type of housing services they provide, who can apply for housing and how applications will be considered. </p>

<p>You can ask to see these policies. Housing associations take the majority of their new tenants from local authority waiting lists, so it is usually best to contact your local council housing department in the first instance before approaching a RSL.</p>

<h2 id="mod-referral-scheme">
<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Referral Scheme</h2>

<p>In the early 1990s, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> established a scheme to re-house Service Leavers through nomination rights originally acquired when surplus <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> properties were sold to Housing Associations. However, because these rights have now ended, the scheme is wholly dependent on the goodwill of Housing Associations, whose properties are not specifically intended for, nor do they belong to, the <abbr title="Joint Service Housing Advice Office">JSHAO</abbr>. The scheme is reliant on Housing Associations requesting referrals for vacant properties but applicants may also be referred to Housing Association waiting lists through this scheme.</p>

<h3 id="the-advantages">The advantages</h3>

<p>Unlike local authority policies, the Scheme is beneficial because it does not demand that you have a local connection with the area for which you are applying. You may apply for a (reasonable) number of areas by listing the locations or counties where you would like to live. A member of the team will then get in contact to discuss the options available in those areas. You are not restricted by where you now live, where your family live, or where you will work, so the Scheme is particularly beneficial for those struggling with the local connection policy.</p>

<p>Single Service Leavers and couples without children may also find it difficult to access housing provided by the Council. On the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Referral Scheme, singles and couples are just as likely to be housed as families because applicants are chosen by their suitability for the type of property offered by the Housing Association. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Service Housing Advice Office">JSHAO</abbr> and the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Referral Scheme have no housing stock, no internal connections with Local Authorities and unfortunately there is no guarantee that applicants will be housed through the Scheme. We cannot estimate how many offers we might receive, when we will receive them or where the properties will be located. This means that while nothing may be available suitable to your needs or in your area of choice, it is equally possible that, eg, a number of 1 bed flats may become available which would only be suitable for singles or couples.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Housing Associations do not require deposits and, although rents are slightly higher than Council rents, they are considerably lower than private rentals. Furthermore, most Associations grant Assured Tenancies, allowing tenants to remain in the property as long as they wish, provided they adhere to the terms of their tenancy agreement.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all applicants are strongly advised to contact their Local Authority and consider alternative housing options, in addition to applying for the Scheme, in order to maximise the chances of being housed. The Scheme attempts to provide another route into Social Housing, not replace such actions as directly contacting Local Authorities.</p>

<p>Service Leavers with families and separated spouses with children may also wish to contact the Services Cotswold Centre, which offers temporary accommodation. Information, advice and hostel accommodation is also available from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ssafa.org.uk/">Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (<abbr title="Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association">SSAFA</abbr>) Forces Help</a>. Single Service Leavers should contact <a rel="external" href="http://www.spaces.org.uk/spaces/spaces/">SPACES</a> (Single Persons Accommodation Centre for the Ex-Services), who may also be able to help.</p>

<p>Additionally, for those who would benefit from adapted and sheltered (both supported and unsupported) accommodation, this type of housing is accessible through the Scheme. Please contact the Scheme Coordinator for more information.</p>

<p>We will also, where applicable, direct you to Choice Based Lettings Schemes operating in your specified areas. So, even if a Housing Association is not participating in the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Referral Scheme, they may form part of a Common Housing Register for an area or county. This also means that applicants requesting areas not covered by those Housing Associations that offer referrals or hold their own waiting lists, may be successful through Choice Based Lettings Schemes. If applicable, further information will be provided with your letter of acknowledgment.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p>To be eligible for the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Referral Scheme, applicants must be Armed Forces personnel within six months of their discharge date and currently occupying Service Accommodation. Applications for the Scheme can be accepted from Service Leavers, married or single, and from separated spouses living in married quarters or hostel accommodation provided by <abbr title="Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> Forces Help and the Services Cotswold Centre. It is important to note that while personnel in Single Living Accommodation (<abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>) are eligible until 6 months post-exit date, those in Service Families Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>) are eligible until they leave that Service property.</p>

<p>Please do not apply if you are Ex-Service or single and beyond the six months after your exit date. If you own or part-own a property or are privately renting, you will not be considered for housing through the Scheme. Similarly, if you have sufficient capital to buy a property you are unlikely to be housed. Pensions and expected gratuities will also be taken into account when processing your application.</p>

<h2 id="the-homebuy-scheme--mortgage-rescue-england">The HomeBuy Scheme &amp; Mortgage Rescue (England)</h2>

<p>HomeBuy is a government-driven initiative that helps eligible individuals and families find homes that meet their current needs. The Government has appointed a number of HomeBuy Agents throughout England to help those who are seeking to live in specific areas.</p>

<p>For many people, this program will provide the best chance of owning a home in the area in which they want to live and work. The initiative also offers rental options for those who are eligible. For vulnerable homeowners who are at risk of repossession the Mortgage Rescue scheme has been developed to help you remain in your home.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-a-homebuy-agent">What is a Homebuy Agent?</h3>
<p>A government-appointed HomeBuy Agent provides a “one-stop-shop” service for home ownership and rental opportunities that exist in these areas around England. By registering with an Agent, individuals are assessed to identify the schemes they are eligible for. HomeBuy Agents work with a number of organisations such as other housing associations, private developers, estate agents and local authorities to ensure customers are kept informed about all the opportunities available to them. </p>

<p>Agents also organise regular HomeBuy shows. At these events, independent financial advisers and solicitors provide affordability assessments and advice free of charge. The HomeBuy show is a great opportunity to find out more information and have queries answered face to face. Entry to these shows is free so visit the respective HomeBuy Agent websites for the latest dates.</p>

<p>There are a number of different scheme types that are offered under the HomeBuy initiative. Depending on your individual circumstances you may find that one or more of these are available to you.</p>

<p>For personnel living or working, or aspiring to live or work in London please visit the <a rel="external" href="http://www.firststepslondon.org/">FIRST STEPS website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="homebuy-direct">HomeBuy Direct</h3>
<p>A shared-equity scheme designed to help first time buyers have 100% ownership of their property. The purchaser will be the legal owner with full title to the home and can sell it on the open market without restriction. The buyer buys a new home, on a designated HomeBuy Direct development, with assistance from the Government and the house builder in the form of two equal equity loans. </p>

<p>The equity Loans would be up to 30% of the purchase price leaving the applicant to raise 70% by way of a mortgage plus a deposit, if available. The equity loans are interest free for the first five years. After that, there is a fee of 1.75%, rising annually by the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 1%.</p>

<h3 id="firstbuy">FirstBuy</h3>
<p>FirstBuy is an equity loan product which gives you the opportunity to buy a new home with the help of up to 20% of the full purchase price. Applicants will be required to fund at least 80% of the purchase price through a conventional mortgage. The FirstBuy equity loan will be interest free for the first 5 years with a charge payable from year 6.</p>

<h3 id="shared-ownership">Shared Ownership</h3>
<p>This scheme offers brand new high quality homes available on a ‘part-buy/part-rent’ basis (also known as NewBuild Homebuy). Under this initiative, eligible individuals are able to become home owners by buying a share of a newly built property (from as low as 25%) and pay a subsidised rent on the portion they don’t own. Individuals then have the opportunity to increase their share of the property as their financial situation allows by ‘staircasing’. </p>

<p>HomeBuy Agents can provide you with details of the developments in your area that offer ‘part-buy/part-rent’ opportunities. From time to time ‘part-buy/part-rent’ properties will become available as a result of existing owners moving further up the property ladder. These are known as ‘Resale’ properties.</p>

<h3 id="intermediate-rent">Intermediate Rent</h3>
<p>This option offers new build properties at 80% (or less) of current market rents and is available through a number of Housing Associations. In most cases the initial period is for 6 months and time frames are reviewed regularly. Under some circumstances, at a later date, there is option to buy a share of the property through another HomeBuy scheme.</p>

<h3 id="rent-to-homebuy">Rent to HomeBuy</h3>
<p>Under this scheme, commonly referred to as “Try Before You Buy”, eligible individuals are able to rent a newly built home provided by a Housing Association at a rate that is normally 80% of the current market rate. Depending on the development the individual has the option to convert the rental agreement into shared ownership (part-buy/part-rent) after a period of 3 years of 5 years. The rental period is designed to provide an opportunity to save for a deposit to put towards buying a share in their home. </p>

<h3 id="social-homebuy">Social HomeBuy</h3>
<p>This scheme allows some social housing or local authority tenants to buy their current home at a discount either outright or on a part-buy/part-rent basis. To do so, their landlord must have decided to take part in the scheme. This is likely to be of interest to tenants who do not qualify for the Right to Buy or Right to Acquire or who are not currently in a position to buy their home outright. Interested parties should contact their landlords to see if they are participating in this scheme.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility-considerations">Eligibility considerations</h3>
<p>Eligibility rules have been amended by the Homes and Communities Agency (<abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency">HCA</abbr>) for existing homeowners. As a result all current home owners who wish to be considered for HomeBuy options are now required to have a ‘Priority Housing Need’ approved by their current Local Authority before they register with the local HomeBuy Agent for the area they wish to live in. </p>

<p>The priority housing need will be assessed in accordance with the Housing Act 1996. In addition, to be eligible for HomeBuy schemes, candidates must fit into one of the following criteria and must not have a household income in excess of £60,000 per annum. Once you have met the initial eligibility criteria, the government has prioritised the following groups for assistance:</p>

<ul>
<li>first time buyer groups who cannot otherwise afford to buy a home on the open market</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Personnel as defined by the <abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency">HCA</abbr> including Regular Armed Forces Personnel</li>
  <li>tenants of councils and housing associations and those who are on the Local Authority Housing Register - <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Personnel and Social tenants who wish to buy a property through HomeBuy are given top priority</li>
  <li>those who have had a major change in circumstances</li>
  <li>current or previous home owners who are looking for a new property as a result of a major change in their personal circumstances, divorce/separation, victim of domestic violence, overcrowding due to a growing family, etc, subject to approval</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you meet these requirements what should you do now?</p>

<p>Register with the HomeBuy Agent covering the area you are interested in (details can be found by visiting the <a rel="external" href="http://www.homebuy.co.uk/">HomeBuy website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mortgage-rescue-scheme">Mortgage Rescue Scheme</h3>
<p>The Mortgage Rescue Scheme has been designed to allow vulnerable home-owners, at risk of repossession, to remain in their homes. For information on how to apply for Mortgage Rescue please click on the External Links section, Further Details on HomeBuy(England). If you are having difficulty in paying your mortgage you should first speak to your mortgage lender. Your local council will also be able to give you advice and assistance to help you stay in your home.</p>

<h2 id="homelessness">Homelessness</h2>

<p>Homelessness means not having a home. Even if you have a roof over your head you can still be homeless. This is because you may not have any rights to stay where you live or your home might be unsuitable for you.</p>

<p>In England and Wales the Housing Act 1996 states that people are homeless if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>there is no accommodation anywhere in the world in which they have a right to live</li>
  <li>hey have accommodation but cannot gain entry to it</li>
  <li>their home is moveable, such as a houseboat or caravan, and they have nowhere to place it</li>
  <li>they have accommodation, but it is not ‘reasonable’ to continue living there, eg, in cases of violence</li>
  <li>there is nowhere for the whole household to live together</li>
</ul>
<p>In Scotland the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 amended by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, states that people are homeless if there is no accommodation they are entitled to occupy. Entitlement means having:</p>

<ul>
<li>an interest in it (ie they are the owner or the tenant)</li>
  <li>an express or implied license to occupy (in Scotland, a right or permission, or an implied right or permission to occupy)</li>
  <li>some other enactment or rule of law giving the right to remain in occupation or restricting the right of another person to recover possession</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, in Scotland a person is also considered to be legally homeless if they have accommodation but: </p>

<ul>
<li>they cannot secure entry to it</li>
  <li>(in the case of, for example, a caravan) they have nowhere they are entitled both to place it and live in it</li>
  <li>it is probable that occupation will lead to violence, or threats of violence which are likely to be carried out</li>
  <li>it is overcrowded and may endanger the health of the occupants</li>
</ul>
<p>In Northern Ireland, the Housing (NI) Order 1988 updated by the Housing (NI) Order 2003 states that:</p>

<p>A person is homeless if he has no accommodation available for his occupation in the UK or elsewhere. A person shall be treated as having no accommodation if there is no accommodation which he, together with any other person who normally resides with him as a member of his family or in circumstances in which it is reasonable for that person to reside with him.</p>

<p>Across the UK, a person is also considered to be ‘threatened with homelessness’ if it is likely that they will become homeless within 28 days (eg because of eviction due to rent or mortgage arrears). In Scotland, this period was extended to 2 months in the 2001 Housing (Scotland) Act).</p>

<p>If you are in <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> or you are facing eviction from <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> and you are hoping to obtain Social Housing (Council/Housing Association), send a copy of the ‘Certificate of Cessation of Entitlement to Occupy <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>/<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>’ or ‘notice to vacate’ to the Homeless Persons Unit of your Local Authority. The certificate is obtained from your Unit/local Housing Information Centre (<abbr title="Housing Information Centre">HIC</abbr>) at <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-if-you-are-homeless">What to do if you are homeless</h3>

<p>Go to your local council and tell them that you wish to apply under the provision of the Housing Act 1996/Homeless Order 2002 for an assessment as a homeless person.</p>

<p>The local councils have legal duties to assist homeless people in some way, either through temporary re-housing or by giving advice and guidance.</p>

<h3 id="are-you-in-a-priority-need-category">Are you in a Priority Need category?</h3>

<p>The main homelessness duties in the 1996 Act apply only to applicants who have a priority need for accommodation. The 1996 Act and the Homeless Order 2002 provide the following categories of applicant have a priority need for accommodation:</p>

<ul>
<li>pregnant women</li>
  <li>16/17 year olds, 18/21 year olds who have been looked after by Social Services in the past</li>
  <li>a person who lives with dependant children under 16, or 16-18 in full time education</li>
  <li>a  person who is vulnerable because of old age, mental illness, physical disability, violence, threats of violence</li>
  <li>a  person who is homeless, or threatened with homelessness because of flood or fire</li>
  <li>a  peson who is vulnerable as a result of having served a custodial sentence</li>
  <li>a  person who is vulnerable as a result of having been a member of Her Majesty’s regular naval, military or air forces (England only)</li>
  <li>a  person formerly serving in the Regular Armed Forces who has been homeless since leaving the Forces (Wales only)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the council recognise you as Priority Need, they will help you find permanent accommodation. It may not necessarily be a council flat/house from the outset as temporary accommodation may have to be utilised prior to allocation of more permanent accommodation.</p>

<h3 id="are-you-in-non-priority-need">Are you in non-priority need?</h3>

<p>Single people, or couples under state retirement age without children and who are not considered vulnerable, do not normally fit the criteria of those in ‘priority need’ in England. This is the same in Wales except for those who have not been able to secure stable accommodation since leaving the services and have a local Welsh connection. </p>

<p>If the council recognise you as Non-Priority it will not have a legal obligation to house you, however you will be offered appropriate advice and assistance on other housing options.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-the-council-decide-that-i-am-intentionally-homeless">How can the council decide that I am intentionally homeless?</h3>

<p>It is up to the council to prove that you are intentionally homeless, not for you to prove that you aren’t. The council has to make enquiries into the reasons you became homeless and must be satisfied that all the following points apply: </p>

<ul>
<li>you deliberately did (or didn’t do) something that caused you to leave accommodation which you could otherwise have stayed in</li>
  <li>it would have been reasonable for you to stay there</li>
</ul>
<p>If the council recognises you as intentionally homeless it will only offer you appropriate advice and assistance.</p>

<p>For single Service leavers, the transition to civilian life can be difficult, and the cost of accommodation outside the Forces often comes as a shock. Many cannot afford the cost of private rental, rent bond etc, while they look for employment. Without accommodation the chances of successfully obtaining employment are reduced, and many end up sleeping on friends’ sofas or floors.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.haighousingtrust.org.uk/">Haig Housing Trust Project</a> <abbr title="Transitional Accommodation for Single ex-Service People">TASSLE</abbr> will give successful applicants an address and firm base for up to a year whilst they seek employment and establish themselves in civilian life.</p>

<h3 id="home-base">Home Base</h3>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.cht.org.uk/therapeutic_projects.php">Home Base</a> is a service for people who are facing homelessness as they leave the armed forces. It aims to help clients integrate successfully into civilian life.</p>

<p>The scheme is managed by Community Housing and Therapy (<abbr title="Community Housing and Therapy">CHT</abbr>) in partnership with Central and Cecil Housing Trust (<abbr title="Central and Cecil Housing Trust">CCHT</abbr>), who provides flats in Paddington. Home Base implemented the findings of a research project funded by the National Lottery Charities Board and carried out by The Homeless Fund. </p>

<p>The report, published in 1996, suggested that there was a high level of demand in central London for a resettlement programme for young single people leaving the Services. Most Home Base clients have come to <abbr title="Community Housing and Therapy">CHT</abbr> from Army Units and The Army Benevolent Fund, together with the Royal British Legion have provided generous financial support for the scheme.</p>

Tenants are given assistance with training, seeking employment and finding more permanent accommodation. The average length of stay is 12-18 months. Prospective residents will be required to demonstrate that they are in housing need and are fully committed to taking part in a programme of training and preparation for employment if not currently employed.</p>

<p>There are approximately 100 Foyers throughout the UK, helping over 5000 young people each year.</p>

<h3 id="the-sir-oswald-stoll-foundation">The Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation</h3>
<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.oswaldstoll.org.uk/">Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation</a> is a charity with a mission to ensure vulnerable and disabled ex-Servicemen and women live as independently as possible. Since 2000, when it was discovered that up to one in four homeless people had a service background, we have focused our work on identifying and tackling the problems now facing homeless ex-Service personnel.</p>

<h2 id="moving-or-buying-abroad">Moving or buying abroad</h2>

<p>Thinking of settling outside the UK when you leave the Service? Have you liked the look of a place while serving there or on holiday? Have days spent in sunshine put you off British weather? Can you see career potential outside the UK? Whatever the reason, there are some basic points you need to consider before making the change.</p>

<p>Migrating to a new country is a life-changing decision. It’s important to research your potential new home very carefully; if possible, speak to other people who have already emigrated to the country for their own experiences.  If you don’t already know someone who has emigrated, there are now numerous websites and forums for expats.</p>

<p>Remember that UK citizens can work and live anywhere within the EU without a need for a special visa. The EU currently includes 27 countries across the continent.</p>

<p>Your chosen country’s embassy in the UK should be your first source for detailed information on their particular immigration procedures and requirements for successful emigration; many countries operate point systems based on qualifications, work experience, finances and other personal factors.</p>

<p>It’s important to begin your emigration application as soon as possible, as with many countries it can take up to 2 years plus to get the appropriate paperwork completed.  For popular destinations such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand its worth using specialist companies’. These can provide information and through their own self-assessment tests, a realistic view of your chances of success.</p>

<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Service Housing Advice Office">JSHAO</abbr> Team have put together a number of questions covering many aspects of Service and civilian housing advice.</p>

<p>Question 01: Do I get discount on buying property due to the fact that I am a Service person/Ex Service person?</p>

<p>A: You have 93 days to remain in the married quarter at the entitled rate (the current rent) after this time you become an irregular occupant and must pay damage for trespass which will be about twice the amount you currently pay (as a guide).

<h2 id="the-ex-service-community">The ex-Service community</h2>

<p>What help is there once you have left the Services? Where can you go to get housing advice and information?</p>

<h3 id="veterans-uk">Veterans-UK</h3>
<p>On 2 April 2007, the Ministry of Defence created a new brand for services to veterans - Veterans-UK.</p>

<p>There are many organisations that provide help and support to UK veterans, both from government and the voluntary sector. This can at times be confusing for those seeking help as they are unsure about which organisation provides which services and from whom to seek help.</p>

<p>Veterans-UK will be the single brand or banner covering a variety of different veterans services provided by a range of different organisations. It will form a single point for accessing information.</p>

<p>The first steps involve a new veterans’ portal website replacing the previous Veterans Agency website. This will provide a single website and e-mail address, <a href="mailto:veterans.help@spva.gsi.gov.uk">veterans.help@spva.gsi.gov.uk</a>, from which information can be obtained. Services provided by the Veterans Services Directorate of Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>) will also come under the Veterans-UK name for promotional and publicity purposes.</p>

<p>For the future, it is hoped the new brand will include other <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> services to veterans and later those from other government departments and possibly voluntary sector organisations. Again, the website will provide the focal point for accessing information on these services.</p>
