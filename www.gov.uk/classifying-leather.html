<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Articles covered in this chapter of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff) are classified according to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the material from which they’re made</li>
  <li>their type and purpose</li>
  <li>other characteristics, such as whether or not they’re handmade</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will help you to identify what is and what isn’t covered in chapter 42.</p>

<p>Chapter 42 mainly covers items made of leather or of composition leather, under heading codes 4201 to 4206. Some of these heading codes also cover items which are characteristic of the leather trade but which are made of other materials, like plastic or textiles.</p>

<p>There are some leather and leather-type articles which chapter 42 doesn’t cover, such as footwear, furniture or watch straps. Items like these are classified in other chapters, according either to their use or to the material they’re made from.</p>

<h2 id="quick-reference-table-for-heading-codes">Quick reference table for heading codes</h2>

<p>Various types of leather goods such as saddlery, travel goods, handbags and cases are covered in chapter 42. Some items made of other materials, or of gut or other animal parts, are also covered.</p>

<p>The following list isn’t exhaustive, but it’ll help you to check quickly whether or not a particular item is likely to be covered in this chapter. </p>

</table>
<p>Items like saddlery, that are classified under heading code 4201, can be made from any material, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>leather</li>
  <li>composition leather</li>
  <li>fur skin</li>
  <li>textiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Items like travel goods that are classified under heading code 4202, are classified by what their ‘outer surface’ is made up of. The outer surface means the outer material that is visible to the naked eye. If the visible material is the top layer of a combination of different materials, then only this top layer counts as the outer surface.</p>

<p>The outer surface of a combination material might be plastic sheeting, perhaps applied over a woven textile fabric, for example. The plastic sheeting can either be made separately (before the combination material is created), or it can be made by applying a coating or covering of plastic to the underlying material. It doesn’t make any difference for classification purposes, provided that the finished outer surface looks the same as an applied layer of manufactured plastic sheeting.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-leather-and-other-materials-commonly-used-with-it">Types of leather and other materials commonly used with it</h2>

<p>Articles covered in this chapter are made from leather, composition leather and in some cases certain other materials such as textiles or plastic sheeting.</p>

<p>The headings below will help you to identify different types of material.</p>

<h3 id="plastic-sheeting">Plastic sheeting</h3>

<p>Plastic sheeting is any flat material made of the plastics covered in chapter 39. It may be shaped by gluing, sewing, welding or moulding (vacuum forming).</p>

<h3 id="textile-material">Textile material</h3>

<p>A textile material is any flat material made of textile fibres that have been woven or knitted. Textile fibres could include plastic strips that are less than 5 millimetres wide.</p>

<h3 id="cellular-plastic-sheeting">Cellular plastic sheeting</h3>

<p>Cellular plastic sheeting is a type of plastic that has many cells throughout the material. The cells can be open, closed or a mixture of both. It’s commonly used for making cases and containers classified under heading code 4202. It’s often used as a substitute for leather and described as ‘imitation leather’, ‘synthetic leather’, ‘PU leather’, ‘vinyl leather’ or ‘PVC leather’.</p>

<h3 id="neoprene">Neoprene</h3>

<p>Neoprene is a cellular rubber that has many cells throughout the material. The cells can be open, closed or a mix of both. It’s normally covered on at least one side by a knitted textile fabric.</p>

<h3 id="leather-composition-leather-and-patent-leather">Leather, composition leather and patent leather</h3>

<p>Leather is the hide or skin of animals such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>cows and other bovine species</li>
  <li>goats and kids</li>
  <li>sheep and lambs - without their wool</li>
  <li>swine</li>
  <li>reptiles like snakes, crocodiles and lizards</li>
</ul>
<p>Animals used for leather must not be on the endangered species list. To check this, contact the UK office of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr>) helpline on 0117 372 8749.</p>

<p>Patent leather is leather that’s been coated with a varnish, lacquer or preformed plastic sheet. It has a shiny mirror-like surface. The varnish or lacquer used can be pigmented or non-pigmented and may be based on:</p>

<ul>
<li>vegetable oil that dries and hardens - linseed oil is normally used</li>
  <li>cellulose derivatives like nitro-cellulose</li>
  <li>synthetic products (including thermoplastics) - polyurethane plastics are normally used</li>
</ul>
<p>If preformed plastic sheet is used to coat the leather, it’s usually made from polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride (PVC).</p>

<p>The surface of patent leather isn’t necessarily smooth. It could be embossed, maybe to imitate crocodile skin, or artificially crushed, crinkled or grained. But it must still have a shiny mirror-like finish.</p>

<p>To be classified as patent leather, the thickness of the coating or sheet must not be more than 0.15 millimetres.</p>

<p>This group of materials also includes leather that is coated with pigmented paint or lacquer to give it a metallic sheen. These paints and lacquers consist of pigments like mica, silica and similar flakes in a binding substance like vegetable oil that dries and hardens, or plastic. Leather that’s been treated like this is known as ‘imitation metallised leather’.</p>

<p>Patent laminated leather is leather that’s been coated with a sheet of preformed plastic that is thicker than 0.15 millimetres but less than half the total thickness of the finished material. It has the same mirror-like finish as patent leather and is sometimes known as ‘patent coated leather’.</p>

<p>If the leather has been covered by a sheet of preformed plastic that is thicker than 0.15 millimetres, but more than half the total thickness of the finished material, then it’s covered in Chapter 39.</p>

<p>Some hand-made items, like saddles, cases and handbags, can only be classified under a ‘hand-made’ subheading if they’ve been certified as hand-made by a recognised authority in the country where they’re produced. They need a special certificate called a handicraft certificate.</p>

<h3 id="artificial-fur">Artificial fur</h3>
<p>For the purposes of the Tariff, artificial fur means imitation fur that’s been made by gumming or sewing wool, hair or other fibres onto leather, or onto a woven fabric. Artificial fur does not include woven or knitted long pile fabrics which are sometimes called fake fur.</p>

<h3 id="parts-and-ornamentation">Parts and ornamentation</h3>
<p>Sometimes articles like bags and belts have parts, fittings or ornamentation made from:</p>

<ul>
<li>precious metal, or metal plated with precious metal</li>
  <li>natural or cultured pearls</li>
  <li>precious or semi-precious stones (these could be natural, synthetic or reconstructed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Provided that these parts or ornamentation do not give an article its essential character, it can be classified in chapter 42. So, for example, a leather belt with a gold buckle would be covered in this chapter as would a leather handbag with a silver frame and an onyx clasp. But if the parts or ornamentation do give an article its essential character then the article is classified in chapter 71.</p>

<h3 id="sports-items">Sports items</h3>

<p>Sports bags are classified under heading code 4202 and include items like:</p>
