<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are various reasons why you may need to make changes to your fishing vessel licence. When you license a new, larger, or more powerful vessel, you can combine your main base licence from your old vessel with other entitlements, or with components from a ‘disaggregated’ licence entitlement. </p>

<h2 id="changes-in-your-circumstances">Changes in your circumstances</h2>

<p>You might need to change your fishing vessel licence because:</p>

<ul>
<li>you sell your vessel</li>
  <li>your vessel sinks, is scrapped or is otherwise deregistered</li>
  <li>you decommission your vessel</li>
  <li>you buy a new, larger or more powerful vessel</li>
  <li>you up-rate your engine power or re-engine your existing vessel</li>
  <li>the licence holder dies</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-vessel-ownership">Changes in vessel ownership</h3>

<p>If the ownership of a vessel changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the new owner must inform the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/shipsandcargoes/mcga-ukshipregister">UK Ship Register - Registry of Shipping and Seamen (<abbr title="Registry of Shipping and Seamen">RSS</abbr>)</a> and local <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/contacts/local.htm">Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation (MMO)">MMO</abbr>) office</a>
</li>
  <li>the licence attached to the vessel becomes invalid</li>
</ul>
<p>What you do next depends on whether you want to keep the licence entitlement.</p>

<p>If you want to sell your vessel but keep the licence you should tell your local <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation (MMO)">MMO</abbr> office within 3 months and create a licence entitlement which you can use to apply for a licence for another vessel. Find out about using your entitlement to apply for a fishing vessel licence.</p>

<p>If you want to transfer your vessel and the attached licence to another person you can arrange to transfer your licence entitlement using form AFL7. The transfer will take place when the bill of sale is completed and the new owner can then apply for a licence in their own name. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/management/licences_apply.htm">find form AFL7 on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation (MMO)">MMO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="your-vessel-is-decommissioned">Your vessel is decommissioned</h3>

<p>If you successfully apply for a grant to decommission your vessel, you must surrender your licence and give up the right to the entitlement.</p>

<h3 id="you-acquire-a-new-vessel-that-is-larger-andor-more-powerful-than-your-old-one">You acquire a new vessel that is larger and/or more powerful than your old one</h3>

<p>You must have the right licence to cover your new vessel. You can cover the tonnage and engine power characteristics of your new vessel by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>acquiring a single licence entitlement - for example, if you buy your new vessel with its licence attached, a licence entitlement will be created which you can use to convert to a licence</li>
  <li>combining (aggregating) your main base licence from your old vessel with one or more entitlement, or with components from a disaggregated entitlement</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="you-up-rate-your-engine-power-or-re-engine-your-existing-vessel">You up-rate your engine power or re-engine your existing vessel</h3>

<p>When you re-engine or up-rate the engine power of your existing vessel you need to acquire sufficient licence cover for this. See the guide on fishing vessel engine power.</p>

<h3 id="the-licence-holder-dies">The licence holder dies</h3>

<p>Your local <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation (MMO)">MMO</abbr> office should be informed if the licence holder dies. The licence automatically becomes invalid on the date of death and is converted to a licence entitlement.</p>

<p>The deceased’s executor is responsible for dealing with the entitlement.</p>

<h2 id="conditions-for-acquiring-licence-cover">Conditions for acquiring licence cover</h2>

<p>When you acquire one or more licence entitlements to license a new vessel that is larger and/or more powerful than your old one, you need to be aware of the conditions that apply.</p>

<p>The combined totals of the tonnage and engine power components you are using to license your new vessel must be enough to cover the tonnage and engine power of the new vessel, taking into account any capacity penalty.</p>

<p>To get enough licence cover for your new vessel you may choose to acquire a single licence entitlement. Or you may decide to combine (aggregate) the main base licence from your old vessel with either:</p>

<ul>
<li>one or more licence entitlements - see the section on aggregating your main licence </li>
  <li>components from a ‘disaggregated’ licence entitlement - see the section on aggregating your main licence </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="capacity-penalties">Capacity penalties</h3>

<p>If you just use a single licence entitlement to license your new vessel, the transaction is exempt and you won’t have to pay any capacity penalty - except where components of a disaggregated entitlement are used to license a smaller vessel in a single licence transaction.</p>

<p>However, if you use aggregation, you will have to pay a capacity penalty. The rate of penalty depends on the type of aggregation used. See the section on capacity penalties on licence transactions.</p>

<h3 id="surplus-remaining-after-transaction">Surplus remaining after transaction</h3>

<p>For transactions where your vessel is licensed using a single licence entitlement, or by aggregating your main base licence with one or more entitlement, any surplus of either tonnage or engine power is lost for good - it cannot be ‘banked’ for use in the future.</p>

<p>But for transactions where your new vessel is licensed by aggregating your main base licence with components from a disaggregated licence, any surplus can be converted to licence entitlements that remain valid for 5 years.</p>

<h2 id="aggregating-your-main-licence-with-one-or-more-entitlement">Aggregating your main licence with one or more entitlement</h2>

<p>To cover the licensing of a new, larger, or more powerful vessel, you can combine (aggregate) the main base licence from your old vessel with one or more licence entitlements that you acquire. But there are certain restrictions that apply when you do this.</p>

<h3 id="licences-of-different-categories">Licences of different categories</h3>

<p>If the licences are not of the same category your vessel licence will be downgraded to a lower level of authority unless you are using Category B and Category C licences in aggregation. This means, for example, that:</p>

<ul>
<li>if your vessel holds a Category A licence and you aggregate that licence with a Category B licence entitlement, the resulting licence will be Category B</li>
  <li>if your vessel is authorised to fish for shellfish, scallops by mechanical dredge, or to beam trawl in Area VII or Area IV, then all the entitlements you acquire must carry these permissions if you want to keep using these opportunities</li>
  <li>for vessels with Category B licences you may use a Category C licence entitlement in aggregations and still keep the right to fish with Category B authority</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-conditions-for-aggregating-licences">Additional conditions for aggregating licences</h3>

<p>The other conditions that apply are that:</p>

<ul>
<li>licences from over 10 metre vessels cannot be aggregated with licence entitlements from vessels of 10 metres and under</li>
  <li>licences from vessels under 8 metres cannot be used in aggregations onto vessels between 8 metres and 10 metres</li>
  <li>a ceiling of 100 kilowatts applies to the aggregation of licences onto vessels under 8 metres</li>
  <li>a ceiling of 150 kilowatts applies to the aggregation of licences onto vessels between 8 and 10 metres</li>
  <li>aggregation of North Sea (Area IV) beam trawl licences is only permitted where the engine power of the vessel on which the licences are to be placed is 1,500 kilowatts or less - vessels of more than 1,500 kilowatts may only be licensed by single licence transfer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="capacity-penalties-1">Capacity penalties</h3>

<p>Capacity penalties are payable on all aggregations - see the section on capacity penalties on licence transactions.</p>

<h3 id="leeway-in-licence-aggregations">Leeway in licence aggregations</h3>

<p>It can be difficult to find an exact match in licence entitlements to provide cover for your new vessel so minor mismatches are allowed. The limits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>vessels of 10 metres and under can have a mismatch of up to 1 tonne or 5 kilowatts</li>
  <li>vessels over 10 metres can have a mismatch of up to 2 tonnes or 10 kilowatts</li>
</ul>
<p>These limits only apply if your entitlements fully cover one or other of the tonnage or kilowatt measurements of the new vessel.</p>

<h2 id="aggregating-your-main-licence-with-disaggregated-licence-components">Aggregating your main licence with disaggregated licence components</h2>

<p>A licence entitlement belonging to someone else can be split (disaggregated) and you can acquire a share of the component elements of tonnage and/or engine power. These can be combined (aggregated) with the main base licence from your old vessel to provide enough tonnage and engine power to license your new vessel.</p>

<h3 id="conditions-for-using-disaggregated-components">Conditions for using disaggregated components</h3>

<p>You can only add licence components to your main licence if your vessel and the donor licence entitlement are in the same fleet band (over 10 metres or 10 metres and under).</p>

<p>When you aggregate component parts onto your main licence, the components of the donor licence must be the same licence category as your main licence - for example, Category A, B or C.</p>

<h3 id="beam-trawling-scallop-dredging-and-shellfish-authorities">Beam trawling, scallop dredging and shellfish authorities</h3>

<p>If your main base licence doesn’t have authorities for beam trawling, scallop dredging or shellfish but your new vessel will need them, you can acquire these authorities along with engine power and tonnage components from a disaggregated entitlement. Once aggregated, your new licence will then include these authorities.</p>

<p>If your main base licence already has these authorities, they will continue on the licence for your new vessel after aggregation. Engine power and tonnage components without these authorities allocated to them can be aggregated with your main base licence and the authorities will continue on the new licence. </p>

<p>But this doesn’t apply to the eligibility to fish in the Cod Recovery Zone (<abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr>) or in the Sole Recovery Zone (<abbr title="Sole Recovery Zone">SRZ</abbr>). Eligibility for these areas depend on the engine power component. The <abbr title="Cod Recovery Zone">CRZ</abbr> or <abbr title="Sole Recovery Zone">SRZ</abbr> eligibility of engine power components you acquire must be of the same level or higher than your main base licence. Otherwise your new licence will lose its previous level of eligibility and reduce to the lower level of the components you acquire.</p>

<h3 id="licence-capping">Licence capping</h3>

<p>If your vessel is 10 metres or under and registered in England, when you aggregate your main licence with at least one disaggregated component to form a new licence, that licence will be capped unless all the components are from uncapped licences.</p>

<h3 id="capacity-penalties-2">Capacity penalties</h3>

<p>When you use disaggregated licence components, you always have to pay a capacity penalty. See the section on capacity penalties in licence transactions.</p>

<h3 id="leeway-in-licensing-transactions">Leeway in licensing transactions</h3>

<p>Aggregating your main base licence with disaggregated licence components gives you much more flexibility than aggregating with a whole licence entitlement. So there is no leeway for minor mismatches of tonnage or engine power.</p>

<h2 id="capacity-penalties-on-licence-transactions">Capacity penalties on licence transactions</h2>

<p>Capacity penalties in licence transactions are used as a tool to gradually reduce the capacity of the UK fishing fleet and with it, the amount of fish that can be caught.</p>

<p>Capacity penalties apply when:</p>

<ul>
<li>a main base licence is aggregated with a licence entitlement to license a new vessel</li>
  <li>a main base licence is aggregated with components from a disaggregated licence entitlement to license a new vessel</li>
  <li>a vessel is licensed in a single licence transfer using components from a disaggregated licence entitlement</li>
  <li>two or more entitlements are aggregated to license a vessel for the first time - see the guide on applying for a fishing vessel licence</li>
  <li>engine power components from a disaggregated licence entitlement are added to a current vessel licence to cover re-engining or engine up-rating - see the guide on fishing vessel engine power</li>
</ul>
<p>The only licence transactions that are exempt from capacity penalties are when a vessel is licensed using a single licence entitlement.</p>

<h3 id="penalty-when-you-aggregate-using-entitlements">Penalty when you aggregate using entitlements</h3>

<p>When you license a new vessel by aggregating the main base licence from your old vessel together with a licence entitlement that you acquire, you pay a capacity penalty of 5%. The penalty is calculated as a percentage of all the donor entitlements used in the licensing transaction, including the main base licence from your old vessel.</p>
