The main ways you can do this are through:\r\n\r\n- mediation\r\n- conciliation\r\n- arbitration\r\n\r\n\r\n##Mediation\r\n\r\nMediation is when an independent and impartial third party discusses a problem with you and your employer (or between you and another employee) to try and find a solution. It's often used after informal discussions haven't come up with a solution.\r\n\r\nMediation is voluntary and the mediator can't force you or your employer to accept a solution.
