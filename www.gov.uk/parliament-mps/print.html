  </header><p>Your <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> represents your interests in the House of Commons, which is part of the UK Parliament. </p>

<p>Parliament is based in Westminster in London. </p>

<p>Its role is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>look at what the government is doing</li>
  <li>debate and pass new laws</li>
  <li>set taxes</li>
  <li>debate issues</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> can use their position to ask government ministers questions about current issues.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/" title="How Parliament works" rel="external">find out more about how Parliament works</a> on the Parliament website.</p>
</div>

<h2>House of Commons</h2>

<p>The House of Commons has 650 elected <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr>. The breakdown of areas (constituencies) they represent is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>533 in England</li>
  <li>59 in Scotland</li>
  <li>40 in Wales</li>
  <li>18 in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
<h2>House of Lords</h2>

<p>This is the ‘upper house’ of Parliament. It works with the Commons to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make laws</li>
  <li>scrutinise the government</li>
  <li>provide independent expertise</li>
</ul>
<p>Members of the Lords can question government ministers to find out what they’re doing. </p>


</article><article id="political-parties"><header><h1>Part 2: Political parties</h1>
  </header><p>A political party is a group of people who have decided to work together because they share similar ideas about how the country should be run. </p>

<h2>The government and the opposition</h2>

<p>After a general election, the party with the most <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> usually forms the new government. The second largest party becomes the official opposition. They can:</p>

<ul>
<li>oppose government proposals they disagree with</li>
  <li>put forward their own policies to try to persuade people to vote for them at the next general election</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out who is in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/" title="Her Majesty's government">government</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/opposition-holding/" title="Her Majesty's official opposition">the official opposition</a> on the Parliament website.</p>

<p>Leaders of the government and the official opposition sit opposite each other on the front benches in the House of Commons. Their supporters are called the ‘backbenchers’ - they sit behind them. </p>

<p>Most candidates in elections belong to one of the main parties. If an <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> doesn’t have a political party, they’re called an ‘independent’.</p>

</article><article id="the-work-of-an-mp"><header><h1>Part 3: The work of an MP</h1>
  </header><p><abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> split their time between working:</p>

<ul>
<li>in Parliament itself</li>
  <li>in the local area (constituency) that elected them</li>
  <li>for their political party</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Some <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> are also government ministers with responsibilities in certain areas, like health or defence.</p>
</div>

<p>When Parliament is meeting, <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> often spend their time working in the House of Commons. Their work here includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>raising issues that affect their constituency </li>
  <li>attending debates</li>
  <li>voting on new laws</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> in their constituency</h2>

<p><abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> often hold ‘surgeries’ in their local office where people can come and discuss things that concern them. These are advertised in local newspapers and public libraries and anyone who lives in their constituency can go along.</p>

<h2>Select committees</h2>

<p>These are small groups of <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> that deal with a particular area of work in detail, like new laws or wider topics like human rights. </p>

<p>They report their conclusions and recommendations to the House of Commons. They can question ministers, civil servants, individuals and any other interested groups. </p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> and the standards they follow</h2>

<p>There are various things in place to make sure <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> carry out their work in line with a set of rules. </p>

<h3>Committee on Standards in Public Life</h3>

<p>This keeps a watch on people in public life, like <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr>. It looks at areas like <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr>’ expenses or how political parties raise money for campaigns.</p>

<p>You can’t complain to the committee about specific people but you can suggest areas they can look at. </p>

<p>There’s more information about the committee on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/" title="Committee on Standards in Public Life">Committee on Standards in Public Life</a> website.</p>

<h3>Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards</h3>

<p>The commissioner trains <abbr title="Members of Parliament">MPs</abbr> in the rules set out by their code of conduct and helps them stick to these rules. If you think an <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> has broken these rules you can make a complaint to the commissioner.</p>
