  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>There are rules to minimise packaging and make sure that most of it can be recovered or recycled. You must follow these rules if you’re a:</p>

<ul>
<li>packaging producer </li>
  <li>packaging designer </li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who ‘handles’ packaging is a <a href="/packaging-waste-producer-supplier-responsibilities/producers" title="packaging producers">producer</a>.</p>

<h2>What is packaging?</h2>
<p>Packaging is anything that is used to contain and protect raw materials or a product and thrown away after the product is consumed. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> A paper cup for tea is considered packaging. A plastic spoon you get with the paper cup isn’t considered packaging.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="designers"><header><h1>Part 2: Packaging designers</h1>
  </header><p>Everyone designing packaging must follow environmental regulations. </p>

<h2>Keep it to a minimum</h2>
<p>You must make sure that the packaging you design only has the minimum weight and volume needed to keep the product safe and hygienic. </p>

<h2>Hazardous substances</h2>
<p>Packaging must not contain high levels of noxious or hazardous substances. </p>

<h2>Recyclable packaging</h2>
<p>Recyclable packaging must be designed so that a certain percentage of the materials used are recyclable. </p>

<h2>Packaging for energy recovery</h2>
<p>Packaging designed to be disposed of through energy recovery (energy through burning materials) must contain at least 50% of organic materials that burn, eg paper, wood, cardboard. </p>

<h2>Biodegradable packaging</h2>
<p>Packaging designed for composting must be biodegradable. </p>

<h2>Reusable packaging</h2>
<p>Reusable packaging must be designed so that it can be used several times. After that is must meet the requirements for recycling, energy recovery or composting. </p>

  </header><h2>Register your business</h2>

<p>You must register your business if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year</li>
  <li>your turnover is more than £2 million a year</li>
</ul>
<p>You ‘handle’ packaging if your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>manufactures or converts raw materials to make packaging</li>
  <li>fills packaging with products</li>
  <li>sells packaged goods to customers</li>
  <li>hires out packaging, eg pallets</li>
  <li>operates a franchise or other licensed business, including pubs</li>
  <li>imports packaging or packaged goods</li>
  <li>brings transit packaging into the UK that will end up as waste in the UK</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>
<p>You don’t have to register if the 50 tonnes of packaging is second hand packaging that is being reused in its original form and for the same purpose.</p>

<h2>How to register</h2>
<p>The way you need to register depends on your turnover:</p>

<ul>
<li>£5 million plus - you must join a <a rel="external" href="http://npwd.environment-agency.gov.uk/PublicRegisterSchemes.aspx" title="compliance scheme">compliance scheme</a> - they’ll register you</li>
  <li>£2-5 million - you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32212.aspx" title="register yourself">register yourself</a> or join a compliance scheme to do it for you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reporting to the Environment Agency</h2>
<p>If you join a compliance scheme, any reports you need to make will be handled by them. Compliance schemes are run by private companies that act as your ‘agent’ with the Environment Agency (in Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and in Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Environment Agency).</p>

<p>They can help you meet your obligations, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>they can recover and recycle your packaging waste</li>
  <li>they can report on how you recover and recycle (known as ‘electronic packaging recovery notes - ePRNs’)</li>
  <li>they can report on your compliance performance</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a fee for joining a compliance scheme. The fee may vary depending on which scheme you choose.</p>
