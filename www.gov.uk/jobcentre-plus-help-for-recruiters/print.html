</article><article id="work-trials"><header><h1>Part 3: Work Trials</h1>
  </header><p>A Work Trial is a way of trying out a potential employee before offering them a job. Once agreed with Jobcentre Plus, you can offer a work trial if the job is for 16 hours or more a week and lasting at least 13 weeks. </p>

  <li>you know they’re committed because they’re volunteering to do it</li>
  <li>there are no wage costs - people continue to get their benefits</li>
  <li>there’s very little paperwork and it’s fuss-free</li>
</ul>
<p>The conditions for a Work Trial are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the duration of the trial must be agreed in advance</li>
  <li>the jobseeker must meet eligibility conditions and volunteer to take part - Jobcentre Plus will check this for you</li>
