<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a livestock farmer, you must ensure that you meet all relevant animal welfare requirements. You must ensure your animals are free from hunger, thirst, discomfort, pain, injury and disease. Animals should not suffer fear or distress and should be free to express their normal behaviour.</p>

<p>This guide explains how you should apply these principles on farms and in situations such as transportation, market and slaughter. You will find information on the specific welfare needs of sheep and goats, and a list of useful organisations that can provide you with additional information.</p>

<h2 id="cross-compliance-good-practice-and-duty-of-care-to-sheep-and-goats">Cross Compliance, good practice and duty of care to sheep and goats</h2>

<p>The Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes it an offence to cause or allow unnecessary suffering to any animal and introduces a duty of care for all animals. As a livestock farmer, you must take such steps as are reasonable to ensure your animals’ welfare.</p>

<p>General welfare requirements for all farmed animals - including sheep and goats - are outlined in the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007.</p>

<p>You must treat all farm livestock - including sheep and goats - so that their health and welfare meets the minimum requirements for care and husbandry.</p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance-requirements">Cross Compliance requirements</h3>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme and other direct payments - eg the Environmental Stewardship scheme - you must comply with Cross Compliance requirements. Under Cross Compliance, you must follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in good agricultural and environmental condition </li>
</ul>
<p>To meet Cross Compliance welfare standards for your sheep and goats, you need to follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 10 - restrictions on the use of substances having hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists in farm animals</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 11 - food and feed law</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 18 - animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smr-10">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 10</h3>

<p>The aim of <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 10 is to prevent residues from beta-agonists and substances with hormonal or thyrostatic effects from entering the human or animal food chain.</p>

<h3 id="smr-11">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 11</h3>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 11 is to help ensure that feed for food-producing animals is safe - so that ultimately our food is safe. </p>

<h3 id="smr-18">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 18</h3>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 18 aims to protect the welfare of all farmed animals by setting minimum standards for their care and husbandry. Key requirements include thoroughly inspecting your livestock as often as necessary to avoid suffering, and ensuring that they are looked after by staff who have the correct skills.</p>

<p>It sets out your obligations regarding minimum standards of accommodation, feeding and watering, and maintenance of equipment used in dealing with livestock. It also outlines which practices are harmful and which you must not use in dealing with your livestock.</p>

<p>This guide includes information on good practice in meeting <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 18 as it applies to sheep and goats.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=249953&amp;id=250030">Find <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 18 on the <abbr title="Agricultural Documents Library">ADLib</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Your farm can be selected for a Cross Compliance inspection to check you are meeting the required standards for the above <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>. These inspections can be carried out by both the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> and/or Animal Health - as their areas of responsibility cover different <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information about Cross Compliance and the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, see the guide on Cross Compliance.</p>

<h3 id="the-five-freedoms-of-animal-welfare">The five freedoms of animal welfare</h3>

<p>The Farm Animal Welfare Council (<abbr title="Farm Animal Welfare Council">FAWC</abbr>) - a government advisory body has identified five freedoms that - if maintained - can help ensure the welfare of your livestock. These state that, at all times, animals should have freedom:</p>

<ul>
<li>from hunger and thirst - animals must have access to fresh water and a diet which will maintain health and vigour</li>
  <li>from discomfort - an appropriate environment should be provided, including shelter and a comfortable resting area</li>
  <li>from pain, injury or disease - you must ensure the prevention of illnesses, or rapid diagnosis and treatment</li>
  <li>to express normal behaviour - sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal’s own kind should all be provided</li>
  <li>from fear and distress - you must provide conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering  </li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.fawc.org.uk/freedoms.htm">read more about the five freedoms of animal welfare on the <abbr title="Farm Animal Welfare Council">FAWC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="welfare-codes-for-sheep-and-goats">Welfare codes for sheep and goats</h3>

<p>You will also need to follow sheep and goats welfare advice in the welfare code for sheep and the welfare code for goats, both published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>). You are legally obliged to ensure that all staff attending your sheep or goats are familiar with - and have access to - the relevant welfare codes. You can find a summary of the sheep and goats welfare codes throughout this guide.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=4154&amp;id=4155">read the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> code of recommendations for the welfare of sheep on the <abbr title="Agricultural Documents Library">ADLib</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?id=000IL3890W.16NTBXIX24U1AJ">Read the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> code of recommendations for the welfare of goats on the <abbr title="Agricultural Documents Library">ADLib</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="housing-shelter-and-environment-for-sheep-and-goats">Housing, shelter and environment for sheep and goats</h2>

<p>Fences and hedges need to be well maintained to prevent injury to your animals, and to minimise the risk of them becoming entangled. If you use mesh fencing, this must be checked frequently - so you can free any animals that become trapped. This is particularly important with horned animals and around lambing fields.</p>

<p>Electric fences must be set up so that they only cause momentary discomfort. Electric mesh fencing is not suitable for horned sheep, or horned or young goats.</p>

<p>For animals not kept in buildings you should - where necessary - provide some form of shelter. This is particularly important for many breeds of goat - which require more protection from bad weather than sheep.</p>

<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>

<p>Housing goats - and sheep during the winter - can improve welfare, but keeping large numbers of animals together may cause additional welfare problems.</p>

<p>This means that you need to pay even greater attention to your livestock’s environmental and nutritional needs. </p>

<p>Housing livestock also increases the likelihood of disease. For more information, see the guide on sheep and goat health. Housed sheep and goats should also have access to a yard or pasture.</p>

<p>You should seek expert advice before constructing or modifying any buildings to accommodate your livestock. It’s particularly important to ensure there is:</p>

<ul>
<li>adequate ventilation, without causing draughts at animal level</li>
  <li>sufficient trough space</li>
  <li>sufficient lying area</li>
</ul>
<p>All surfaces accessible to your animals should be free from anything that could cause injury or death, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>sharp edges or projections</li>
  <li>electrical wires</li>
  <li>toxic paint or wood preservative - beware of lead-based paint if using second-hand materials</li>
</ul>
<p>Housed animals must have access at all times to a lying area which is clean and dry with suitable bedding, such as straw. Regular provision of fresh bedding is particularly important during lambing or kidding.</p>

<p>Flooring should be designed, constructed and maintained to avoid any discomfort or injury. Solid floors should be well drained.</p>

<p>When penned, the space allowance should be calculated according to appropriate advice - in relation to the age, size and class of the stock.</p>

<h3 id="lighting">Lighting</h3>

<p>Housed livestock should experience periods of light and darkness comparable with living outside. So, where natural light is insufficient, artificial light needs to be controlled to ensure contrasting dark periods.</p>

<p>Fixed or portable lighting should always be available so that you can thoroughly inspect your animals at any time.</p>

<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>

<p>You must regularly clean all equipment and any equipment essential to the welfare of your livestock should be inspected for any defects at least once a day. Examples of such equipment include:</p>

<ul>
<li>drinkers</li>
  <li>ventilating fans</li>
  <li>heating</li>
  <li>lighting</li>
  <li>alarm systems</li>
  <li>fire extinguishers</li>
  <li>milking machines</li>
</ul>
<p>Any defects found should be fixed as soon as possible. Back-up systems should be in place where necessary to safeguard the welfare of your sheep or goats.</p>

<h3 id="hazards-and-emergencies">Hazards and emergencies</h3>

<p>As far as possible you should protect your animals from any potential hazards, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>on-farm debris - eg wire or plastic</li>
  <li>open drains</li>
  <li>predators - including dogs</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also try to protect your livestock from flooding or being buried by snow. These risks can be minimised by careful siting of shelters and fencing.</p>

<p>If livestock are housed, you need to plan in advance how you will deal with emergencies such as fires. This should include an evacuation procedure for the quick release of your animals which all relevant staff are familiar with.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-for-sheep">Good practice for sheep</h3>

<p>Lameness can be a major welfare problem for sheep. Levels of lameness are likely to increase when sheep are densely stocked - particularly if ground conditions are damp.</p>

<p>There are some measures you can take that can help reduce lameness, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>regularly supplying fresh, dry bedding - particularly if sheep are fed wet diets</li>
  <li>providing a grass or stubble area if necessary due to heavy clay soil</li>
  <li>dipping</li>
  <li>ensuring roads, tracks, flooring and handling facilities are well maintained</li>
  <li>feeding of zinc supplements</li>

<p>Space allowances can be reduced by 10% for winter-shorn sheep. Pregnant ewes should be kept in groups of less than 50 where possible. This is to help ensure you can give them the necessary attention at lambing time.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-for-goats">Good practice for goats</h3>

<p>Goats have a tendency to jump and clamber, so fencing needs to be strong and high enough - at least 1.2 metres - to prevent their escape. Due to their very inquisitive nature, all gate fastenings should also be goat-proof.</p>

<p>Being sociable animals, goats prefer to live in groups. Goats kept singly need more frequent contact and supervision.</p>

<p>Introducing new goats to an existing group can result in bullying. Increasing the space allowance or penning the new animal(s) next to the existing group for a short period can help alleviate this.</p>

<p>Horned and polled goats should not be kept in the same pen unless they have been reared together.</p>

<p>Any male goats which are housed should be within sight and sound of other livestock.</p>

<h2 id="feeding-and-watering-sheep-and-goats">Feeding and watering sheep and goats</h2>

<p>Feeding and watering equipment needs to be designed and sited to minimise contamination or freezing. It should be kept thoroughly clean and checked at least once a day - more frequently during extreme weather.</p>

<p>You should take care to ensure it’s not possible for lambs or kids to get into troughs and drown.</p>

<p>When animals are fed in groups, there needs to be sufficient trough space or feeding points to avoid excessive competition.</p>

<p>Your livestock should have access to fresh, clean, water at all times and feed at least once a day - more often if necessary. Food should only be withheld if instructed by a vet.</p>

<p>You should ensure feed is palatable and placed in suitable racks or containers, and remove any leftover food if it becomes stale. You should avoid any sudden changes to the type or quantity of feed.</p>

<p>Diet must be balanced and adequate to maintain full health and vigour. It’s also important that you ensure adequate supplies of feed and water are available in the event of severe winter weather or a drought.</p>

<h3 id="feed-law">Feed law</h3>

<p>Statutory Management Requirement 11 sets out your Cross Compliance obligations regarding food and feed law for livestock. You must ensure that you do not place unsafe food or feed on the market, or provide unsafe feed to food-producing animals. You must also have in place procedures for hygiene and traceability.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal food and feed law.</p>

<p>Feed contaminants such as lead or antimicrobial residues - or biological agents such as botulism - may cause disease in sheep and goats and make their produce unsuitable for human consumption.</p>

<p>To ensure that your animals produce products fit for human consumption you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that unsafe feed is withdrawn from the market if you believe that you have supplied it - inform your local authority and the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) if this has happened</li>
  <li>destroy unsafe feed - unless an advising authority has told you not to</li>
  <li>tell users of feed of the reason for any withdrawal if they have received notification of it</li>
  <li>arrange for unsafe feed to be recalled if health protection levels cannot be reached</li>
  <li>tell your local authority and the <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> if feed that you have supplied - or that is in your possession and you intend to sell - could be dangerous to health and you have taken action to prevent risks to the consumer</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>place unsafe food or feed on the market</li>
  <li>give unsafe feed to food-producing animals</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal food and feed law.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-for-sheep-1">Good practice for sheep</h3>

<p>When feeding all your sheep at once, the minimum trough space required is approximately:</p>

<ul>
<li>45 centimetres for lowland ewes</li>
  <li>30 centimetres for smaller hill ewes</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if sheep have constant access to a supply of hay and silage, trough space can be reduced to 10-12 centimetres per ewe - depending on size.</p>

<p>If you intend to give your sheep a diet consisting of high intakes of cereal-based feed, this needs to be introduced gradually. Sufficient roughage or a suitable high-fibre concentrate is also necessary during this period. Mineral mixtures should be specifically designed to avoid urinary problems in males. Additional care needs to be taken to provide plenty of trough space to stop individual sheep from gorging.</p>

<p>You can only use compound feeds or mineral preparations suitable for sheep. In particular, beware of susceptibility to copper poisoning, which can vary according to breed.</p>

<p>Sheep with poor teeth should be given food they can eat without difficulty and their body condition needs careful monitoring. </p>

<h3 id="good-practice-for-goats-1">Good practice for goats</h3>

<p>Goats need a large quantity of bulky feed, such as coarse forages and tree branches.</p>

<p>Suitable foods for housed goats include:</p>

<ul>
<li>pea and bean haulm</li>
  <li>clover</li>
  <li>lucerne and meadow hay</li>
  <li>silages</li>
  <li>coarse, flaky or pelleted concentrated food</li>
</ul>
<p>You should position hay racks and nets to avoid risk of injury to the goats - particularly to the eyes. Hay nets are not suitable for young kids or horned goats, due to the risk of entanglement.</p>

<p>Goats should not be overfed - eg with concentrates - as this can cause problems such as bloat, acidosis, laminitis and obesity.</p>

<p>Grazing should include a variety of plants to ensure adequate intake of roughage and minerals. If this isn’t possible, you will need to provide supplementary feed.</p>

<p>Goats are browsing animals so should be denied access to poisonous plants, shrubs and trees. Those most poisonous to goats include</p>

<ul>
<li>bracken</li>
  <li>buckthorn</li>
  <li>cowbane</li>
  <li>deadly nightshade</li>
  <li>dogs mercury</li>
  <li>fox glove</li>
  <li>greater celendine</li>
  <li>hemlock</li>
  <li>henbane</li>
  <li>laburnum</li>
  <li>laurel</li>
  <li>privet</li>
  <li>ragwort</li>
  <li>thododendron</li>
  <li>rhubarb leaves</li>
  <li>spindle</li>
  <li>water bryony</li>
  <li>water dropwort</li>
  <li>water hemlock</li>
  <li>yew</li>
</ul>
<p>Goats also prefer water which is not excessively cold, so this should be taken into account when housing them.</p>

<h2 id="sheep-and-goat-stock---keeping-and-milking">Sheep and goat stock - keeping and milking</h2>

<p>Anyone attending to farm animals must be familiar with the welfare code for the species. </p>

<p>It’s essential that those responsible for the welfare of your livestock have adequate stock keeping skills. Training which leads to a formal qualification is preferable, but it’s also possible to gain these skills on-farm - through working with an experienced person.</p>

<p>The number of sheep or goats, stocking rate and breed will depend on the competence of the person caring for them - as well as environmental factors. It’s important that sufficient time is allowed to regularly inspect your animals and take any remedial action as necessary. You may need to employ additional experienced and competent staff during busy periods - such as lambing and shearing.</p>

<p>Livestock kept in husbandry systems where welfare depends on frequent human attention must be thoroughly inspected at least once a day. In other cases, inspection should be frequent enough to avoid unnecessary suffering. Frequency will need to increase when there are factors which affect animal welfare, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>extreme weather</li>
  <li>lambing and kidding</li>
  <li>fly strike</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to pay particular attention to signs of injury, distress, illness or infestation. For more advice, see the guide on sheep and goat health.</p>

<p>If an unfit animal doesn’t respond to treatment it should be killed humanely on-farm. It’s an offence to allow suffering to continue unnecessarily. </p>

<h3 id="shearing">Shearing</h3>

<p>Shearers should be adequately trained, competent and experienced - or supervised by someone who is. Care needs to be taken not to cut the skin, with immediate treatment given if this does happen. All equipment should be cleaned and disinfected to minimise the spread of disease.</p>

<p>Weather forecasts should be checked to avoid newly shorn animals suffering from excessive cold stress - regardless of the time of year.</p>

<h3 id="milking">Milking</h3>

<p>Milking parlours, pens, ramps and milking equipment needs to be properly designed and maintained to prevent injury or distress to livestock. This includes ensuring that milking machines are functioning correctly in terms of vacuum levels, pulsation rates and ratios.</p>

<p>Husbandry systems for milk sheep and goats are often more intensive, so you need to be especially vigilant to ensure welfare is maintained. This includes awareness of the specific problems affecting lactating sheep and goats and how these problems can be avoided or alleviated. A vet’s advice should be sought wherever necessary.</p>

<p>Milking should be carried out at least daily - more often if necessary - to ensure your sheep or goats aren’t left with unrelieved, distended udders. Good milking practices include:</p>

<ul>
<li>high standards of hygiene</li>
  <li>carefully handling teats to avoid injury</li>
  <li>examining the foremilk for signs of ill health</li>
  <li>avoiding excessive stripping</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sheep">Sheep</h3>

<p>All mature sheep should have their fleece removed at least once a year. But shearing shouldn’t be carried out in the winter - unless your sheep are housed.</p>

<p>Winter-shorn sheep should only be turned out to grass when it turns warmer in the spring and their fleece has regrown to at least 15 millimetres. You should provide additional shelter - such as straw bales - if shelter isn’t available naturally.</p>

<p>You should have suitable handling pens to aid routine management and treatment.</p>

<p>Sheep should be handled or restrained by placing one arm under the neck - holding the neck wool if necessary - and the other around the rear. It’s not acceptable to lift or drag sheep by the fleece, tail, ears, horns or legs.</p>

<p>Restraint devices such as raddles, harnesses, tethers and yokes should be properly fitted and adjusted to avoid causing injury or discomfort. These shouldn’t be used for longer than necessary and it’s important to check on such animals regularly. Tethering by the horns is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Condition scoring your sheep is an easy technique to learn which can contribute significantly to good husbandry. <a rel="external" href="http://www.smallstock.info/tools/condscor/cs-sheep.htm">Read about body condition scoring of sheep on the Smallstock in Development website.</a></p>

<p>Aerosols or paints used for marking sheep should be non-toxic. Any permanent marking - eg tattooing or tagging - should only be carried out by trained staff using proper equipment that’s in good working order. Such methods should also be avoided, where possible, during the fly season - or at least in combination with measures to reduce the threat of fly strike.</p>

<p>If you are permanently marking horned breeds of sheep, horn branding is the preferred method.</p>

<p>If possible, tail docking should be avoided. This practice is only acceptable when not doing it will cause welfare problems relating to dirty tails and fly strike. This must be done by a competent person and sufficient tail must be retained to cover the sheep’s anus or vulva.</p>

<p>Castration should only be carried out where lambs will be kept beyond sexual maturity and it’s necessary to avoid welfare problems associated with managing entire males. Because of the risk of mis-mothering - which can lead to starvation - it shouldn’t be performed until the bond between ewe and lamb is established.</p>

<p>Castration should only be performed by a trained and competent person. The use of a rubber ring, or other device, to restrict the flow of blood to the scrotum - or tail - is only permitted without an anaesthetic if applied during the first week of life. Once a lamb reaches three months, castration must be carried out under anaesthetic by a vet.</p>

<p>If both tail docking and castration are necessary, performing both operations at the same time can minimise distress and the risk of mis-mothering.</p>

<p>The following practices are all banned by law:</p>

<ul>
<li>penis amputation and other penile operations</li>
  <li>tooth grinding</li>
  <li>freeze dagging</li>
  <li>electro-immobilisation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goats">Goats</h3>

<p>Goats are particularly susceptible to changes in temperature. So, unless housed, goats should only be shorn in suitable weather conditions.</p>

<p>Combing is preferable during adverse weather. If weather turns bad after shearing and no housing is available, coats should be provided instead.</p>

<p>If goats are tethered, you must ensure they are checked regularly and take care to avoid distress or injury that could be caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>exposure to adverse weather - provide shelter</li>
  <li>hunger or thirst - provide sufficient food and water</li>
  <li>entanglement</li>
  <li>vulnerability to being worried by dogs or children</li>
</ul>
<p>Collars need to be light - but substantial - and attached to a strong chain at least three metres long and with at least two swivels.</p>

<p>Young goats should never be tethered.</p>

<p>Castration must be carried out by a trained, competent person in accordance with the law. Disbudding and dehorning can only be carried out by a vet - ideally at two to three days old, and no later than ten days. Regular foot trimming should be carried out when necessary.</p>

<h2 id="breeding-and-pregnancy-in-sheep-and-goats">Breeding and pregnancy in sheep and goats</h2>

<p>You should not use any natural or artificial breeding procedures that may cause suffering or injury to animals, except where this is momentary or not likely to cause lasting injury. Hormone treatments to produce multiple embryos and embryo transfer must be carried out by veterinary surgeons only.</p>

<p>Make sure that pregnant and nursing females get enough food and water to maintain their body condition while also allowing healthy development of lambs/kids. </p>

<p>Heavily pregnant females need to be handled carefully to avoid distress or injury that could cause premature lambing or kidding. However, if treatment is necessary for welfare reasons - eg for lameness - this should be given as soon as possible and not left until after lambing or kidding.</p>

<p>You need to ensure you have enough lambing/kidding pens, of sufficient size, that are dry and well-drained. Each should contain a hay rack, feed trough and water bucket. Where lambing or kidding takes place outdoors, you should provide some form of shelter and windbreak.</p>

<p>Hygiene is of particular importance during pregnancy and lambing/kidding. This includes personal cleanliness for anyone handling the livestock as well as regularly cleaning pens and equipment.</p>

<p>If a stockperson has difficulty delivering a lamb or kid single-handedly, they should be given help immediately.</p>

<p>A heat source - eg a warmer box - should be available to revive weak lambs or kids - particularly when artificial rearing is necessary. However, take care to avoid overheating.</p>

<p>Any dead lambs or kids should be removed from pens without delay. See the guide on dealing with animal by-products.</p>

<h3 id="sheep-1">Sheep</h3>

<p>Electro-ejaculation of rams can only be carried out by a vet. The same also applies for vasectomies.</p>

<p>Pregnancy scanning of ewes to establish the number of lambs each is carrying can help ensure your lambing preparations are adequate.</p>

<p>Scanning is particularly useful when combined with condition scoring. Thin ewes and those carrying more than one lamb can be separated for special feeding and supervision.</p>

<p>Milk sheep are naturally prolific - so extra attention needs to be paid to the level of nutrition provided for these during pregnancy and lactation.</p>

<p>A large proportion of ewe mortalities occur during the period around lambing. Severe damage can be caused by inexperience when assisting a ewe in difficulty - so it’s vital that staff responsible have sufficient expertise.</p>

<p>Shepherds should be able to recognise when lambs need resuscitating and be familiar with the necessary techniques and survival aids. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=107983&amp;id=107984">Download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on improving lamb survival from the <abbr title="Agricultural Documents Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 284KB).</a></p>

<p>Any ewe suffering a prolapse must be treated immediately - you should seek veterinary advice if necessary.</p>

<p>A newly born lamb should receive colostrum from its dam, or another source, within three hours of birth - the sooner the better. It’s important to have spare supplies available for use in emergencies.</p>

<p>If gathering, handling, transporting or dipping ewes and lambs, keep group sizes to a minimum to reduce the risk of mis-mothering. Identifying lambs and mothers using non-toxic colour markers is another good precaution.</p>

<h3 id="artificially-rearing-lambs">Artificially rearing lambs</h3>

<p>For artificially reared lambs, you need to take extra care to ensure they are adequately sheltered, warm enough and you can supply enough colostrum.</p>

<p>A suitable liquid feed - eg ewe milk replacer - should be provided at regular intervals each day for at least the first four weeks. From the second week of life, you should also provide access to nutritious solid food - which may include grass - and a constant supply of fresh, clean water.</p>

<p>If automatic feeding equipment is used, lambs need to be trained how to use it properly. The equipment must also be checked daily to ensure that it’s working properly.</p>

<h3 id="goats-1">Goats</h3>

<p>For goats, ensuring sufficient food is available is particularly important during the last six weeks of pregnancy. Kidding pens should be within sight and sound of other goats. A newly-born kid should receive colostrum from its dam - or another source - as soon as possible, and certainly within six hours of birth.</p>

<h3 id="artificially-reared-kids">Artificially reared kids</h3>

<p>Artificially reared kids should have constant access to milk substitutes, or be fed at least twice a day. Fresh fibrous food should be available from when the kid is one to two weeks old.</p>

<h2 id="sheep-and-goats-welfare-during-transportation-at-market-and-at-shows">Sheep and goats welfare during transportation, at market and at shows</h2>

<p>When moving animals, you must transport them in a way that won’t cause them injury or unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>Whilst European Union rules apply to all live, vertebrate animals transported for economic reasons, more stringent elements apply to the transport of farm livestock, such as pigs.</p>

<p>When transporting livestock, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>plan journeys thoroughly and keep the duration to a minimum</li>
  <li>ensure the animals are fit to travel and check them regularly</li>
  <li>ensure vehicle loading and unloading facilities are constructed and maintained to avoid injury and suffering</li>
  <li>ensure those handling animals are competent and don’t use violence or any methods likely to cause fear, injury or suffering</li>
  <li>provide sufficient floor space and height allowance</li>
  <li>provide water, feed and rest as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal welfare during transportation.</p>

<h3 id="fitness-for-travel">Fitness for travel</h3>

<p>It’s illegal to transport an animal that’s considered unfit for travel. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>shorn sheep during cold weather - particularly November to March</li>
  <li>very young animals - eg lambs of less than one week - unless the journey is less than 100 kilometres</li>
  <li>new-born mammals where the navel has not completely healed</li>
  <li>heavily pregnant females - where more than 90 per cent of the expected gestation period has passed</li>
  <li>females who have given birth during the previous seven days</li>
  <li>sick or injured animals where moving them would cause additional suffering - unless instructed by a vet</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>

<p>Local authorities have primary responsibility for enforcing the rules to protect animals during transportation. Veterinary inspectors from Animal Health also have powers to ensure transporters are following the rules.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> collects information about any transporters caught breaking the law from local authorities, Animal Health and authorities abroad. This information is used when deciding whether to grant, suspend or cancel transporter authorisation.</p>

<h3 id="livestock-welfare-at-market-and-shows">Livestock welfare at market and shows</h3>

<p>There is general and specific legislation covering the welfare of animals at markets and shows - in particular Welfare of Animals at Markets Order 1990.</p>

<p>These specify that owners and keepers must provide animals with a suitable environment, good diet, the opportunity to ‘act normally’, sufficient housing, and protection from pain, injury, suffering and disease.</p>

<p>All animal owners are also responsible for the health and welfare of their animals and therefore need to understand and provide for their physical and welfare needs. They have a duty of care towards the animal and must recognise the signs of illness or disease. They also have a responsibility to be vigilant, report any suspicion of disease and maintain good disease prevention and control practice, including compliance with regulations.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal welfare at shows and markets.</p>

<h3 id="specific-sheep-and-goat-welfare-provisions">Specific sheep and goat welfare provisions</h3>

<p>You must also follow welfare rules specific to transporting sheep, which include:</p>

<ul>
<li>maximum journey times and rest periods</li>
  <li>transporting lambs</li>
  <li>transporting pregnant ewes or any that have recently given birth</li>
  <li>ramp angles for loading and unloading</li>

<h2 id="sheep-and-goats-welfare-at-slaughter-and-fallen-stock">Sheep and goats welfare at slaughter and fallen stock</h2>

<p>The welfare of animals at the time of slaughter or killing is covered by European Union Directive 93/119 and UK regulations. These rules state that animals must never be submitted to any avoidable excitement, pain or suffering, and must be handled, stunned and killed using specific methods by licensed slaughtermen.</p>

<p>The welfare requirements also apply to on-farm slaughter - although an owner killing an animal for private consumption does not need a slaughter licence.</p>

<p>There are special arrangements which apply to where Jewish or Muslim slaughter methods are used, eg the need for a slaughter licence for the food of Jews and Muslims.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide farmed animal welfare at slaughter.</p>

<h3 id="fallen-stock">Fallen stock</h3>

<p>‘Fallen stock’ can be any animal that has:</p>

<ul>
<li>died of natural causes or disease on the farm</li>
  <li>been killed on the farm for reasons other than human consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>Farmers with fallen stock must use approved means and places for their disposal. The National Fallen Stock Company (<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>) can help with the disposal of fallen stock and advise on the disease prevention rules, as part of the National Fallen Stock Scheme (<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Scheme">NFSS</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you suspect that an animal has died of a notifiable disease, you must tell the Animal Health agency immediately.</p>

<p>There are also special regulations governing on-farm incineration, and the disposal of dead horses.</p>

<p>For more information, you can see the guide on fallen stock.</p>
