<p>Unless your child is in care because of an <a href="children-in-hospital-or-residential-care" title="Children in hospital or residential care">illness or disability</a>, Child Benefit payments usually stop after 8 weeks.</p>

<p>You can <a href="/child-benefit/how-to-claim" title="Claim Child Benefit">claim again</a> for Child Benefit after 8 weeks if your child is at home for either:</p>

<ul>
<li>7 days or more in a row before going back into care (you can claim Child Benefit for the time they spent at home)</li>
  <li>24 hours every week (you’ll get Child Benefit as long as that continues)</li>
</ul></article><article id="children-in-hospital-or-residential-care"><header><h1>Part 2: Children in hospital or residential care</h1>
  </header><p>You get Child Benefit for 12 weeks (84 days) if your child goes into hospital or residential care. After that, you may get Child Benefit if you’re spending the payment on your child, eg for clothes. </p>

<h2>Multiple hospital visits</h2>
<p>If there’s less than 28 days between hospital or residential care stays this counts as 1 stay. You’ll need to add up the days so you can tell the Child Benefit Office.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Your child is in hospital for 80 days and comes home for 5 days. They then go back into hospital for 7 days. This is 87 days in total so you need to show if you’re spending the payment on your child, eg for clothes, to get Child Benefit.</p>
</div>

<h2>Medical treatment in hospital abroad</h2>
<p>You can get Child Benefit for 12 weeks if your child is getting medical treatment in hospital abroad for an illness or disability they had before they left, or happened while away.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Your child must be ‘temporarily abroad’ - the trip was supposed to last less than a year.</p>
</div>

<p>You could get Child Benefit after 12 weeks if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>come back to the UK to claim (your child can still be abroad)</li>
  <li>you’re spending the payment on your child, eg for clothes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_Specific?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="Email the Child Benefit Office">tell the Child Benefit Office</a> if either:</p>

<ul>
<li>your child is in hospital or residential care for more than 12 weeks (84 days) and you won’t be spending the payment on your child</li>
  <li>you’re going abroad with your child for more than 8 weeks</li>
</ul></article><article id="children-living-with-an-expartner"><header><h1>Part 3: Children living with an ex-partner</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Only 1 person can get Child Benefit for a child - this is usually who the child normally lives with.</p>
</div>

<h2>Multiple claims for 1 child</h2>
<p>The Child Benefit Office will tell you if they get another claim for your child. </p>

<p>It’s best if you sort out between you who should claim Child Benefit. If you can’t, the Child Benefit Office will decide. You can appeal the decision by <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_Specific?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="Email the Child Benefit Office">contacting the Child Benefit Office.</a></p>

<h2>Changing the person who gets Child Benefit</h2>
<p>If you want someone else to claim Child Benefit, <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_Specific?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="Email the Child Benefit Office">contact the Child Benefit Office:</a></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Explain you want to stop getting Child Benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain who you want to get Child Benefit instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other person will need to <a href="/child-benefit/how-to-claim" title="Claim Child Benefit">make a new claim</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you change your mind later, you’ll need to make a new claim yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol></article><article id="children-who-leave-home"><header><h1>Part 4: Children who leave home</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after your child leaves home to live with someone else (eg a friend or relative) unless that person makes a Child Benefit claim.</p>

<p>You could continue to get Child Benefit if you’re contributing:</p>

<ul>
<li>to your child’s upkeep</li>
  <li>at least as much as the Child Benefit payment</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Upkeep includes clothes, presents, food and pocket money and financial contributions to the house where your child lives.</p>
</div>

<p>You might get Child Benefit if you’re making payments towards your child’s maintenance under a court order or agreement. <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_Specific?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="Email the Child Benefit Office">Contact the Child Benefit Office.</a></p>
