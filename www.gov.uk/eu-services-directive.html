<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>EU Member states were required to implement the Directive by 28 December 2009. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>) leads on implementation in the UK and has worked closely with other government departments, the devolved administrations, local authorities, regulators and others in tasks such as screening legislation for compliance with the Directive. We have also worked to establish an online ‘Point of Single Contact’ for service providers to find out about doing business in the UK and apply for licences online. </p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_376/l_37620061227en00360068.pdf" title="EU Service Directive Final Text 27 December 2006">EU Service Directive Final Text 27 December 2006</a></p>

<h2 id="businesses---licence-applications">Businesses - licence applications</h2>

<p>Businesses can apply online for licences needed in other EU countries through their <a rel="external" href="http://www.eu-go.eu/" title="Points of Single Contact">Points of Single Contact</a>.</p>

<p>Licences may also be found on GOV.UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/licence-finder" title="Licence find">Licence finder</a>.</p>

<p>Businesses from outside of the UK can access online licence applications and information about doing business in the UK at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-welcomes-business">UK Welcomes</a>.</p>

<p>The European Commission has produced a video that highlights the benefits of the Point of Single Contact:</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWgsD5GDJ-g">Points of Single Contact - Services Directive</a></p>

<p>See also the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file53100.pdf">Guidance for Businesses on the Provision of Services Regulations 2009</a>, which provides more detail of the benefits and obligations of the Services Directive.</p>

<h2 id="consumers">Consumers</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukecc-services.net/">European Consumer Centre for Services</a> is a portal with information about your rights when buying services in other EEA countries. It’s a new free website and telephone service for consumers that provides general information on consumer laws and rights when buying a service in other European countries. </p>

<p>Services that UK consumers can get advice on include tourism services such as hotels, timeshares and car hire; construction services such as architects, builders, electricians and plumbers; estate agents and letting agents; private education providers such as language schools; and accountancy services and lawyers. </p>

<p>The website also has contact details of organisations that could provide practical assistance in the case of dispute. </p>

<h2 id="other-government-departments-devolved-administrations-and-competent-authorities">Other government departments, devolved administrations and competent authorities</h2>

<p>We have published practical guidance on how to remain compliant with the continuing obligations of the Services Directive: </p>

<p>The Directive was brought into UK law by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2009/9780111486276/contents">Provision of Services Regulations 2009</a>, which came into effect on 28 December 2009. The Regulations affect a very wide range of service businesses. This guidance is aimed at those bodies who set rules or requirements which service providers have to comply with, and those who are involved in authorising service providers (ie ‘competent authorities’).</p>

<p>These bodies include government departments, devolved administrations, local authorities, licensing and authorisation bodies and other authorities such as professional bodies or bodies who maintain required registers or deliver required training qualifications. The guidance contains user friendly flowcharts which will guide you through the steps that you need to take, and point you to the sections of the guidance that you will need to look at. </p>

<p>Detailed guidance for businesses on the Provision of Services Regulations 2009 can be found below. Since the Regulations have now been made, this guidance is final:</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file53100.pdf">Guidance for business on the Provision of Services Regulations</a> </p>

<p>The following documents provide a summary of the implications of the Services Directive for business:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="provision-of-services-regulations">Provision of Services Regulations</h3>

<p>The Provision of Services Regulations 2009 were made on 11 November 2009. They are the main Statutory Instrument which will implement the EU Services Directive into UK law.</p>

<p>In May 2009, we asked for comments on the draft Regulations. The government’s response to these comments can be found below, along with the draft statutory instrument and transposition note:</p>

<p>The Regulations are due to come into force on 28 December 2009. As a general principle, the Regulations do no more than transpose the Directive. Where this is not the case, this is highlighted in the Transposition Note.</p>

<p>And in 2004, before the Directive was agreed at EU level, the government also ran <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100216092443/http://www.berr.gov.uk/consultations/page27714.html">EU Directive Services in Internal Market Consultation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="screening-flowcharts-for-competent-authorities">Screening flowcharts for competent authorities</h2>

<p>This document will help guide you through the steps involved in reviewing (or ‘screening’) any requirements that you impose on service providers for compliance with the Directive. Before attempting to use the flowcharts yourself it is advisable that you: </p>

<ul>
<li>have read the following information </li>
  <li>have access to ‘Documents to help competent authorities screen’ (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="screening">Screening</h3>

<p>The Directive aims to make it easier for businesses to provide services in all member States (EU countries). One way of doing this is by the removal of unjustifiable barriers to service provision. All requirements (for example authorisation schemes and registration processes) which are imposed on service providers must be screened to ensure that they are for example non-discriminatory, necessary and proportionate. Any requirements that cannot be justified under the terms of the Directive will need to be amended or abolished in order to be compliant with the Directive. Any requirements that can be justified under the terms of the Directive must be reported on by <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> to the EU Commission by the 28 December 2009. </p>

<p>Document 2 below will show you whether legislation in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland has been screened and justified under the terms of the Directive or will be amended to comply with the Directive. Later in the year we will update the website with those authorisation schemes, authorisation scheme procedures or other requirements that government views are not justified together with the amendments that are being made as a result to legislation. Please look out for this information, so that you are aware of how you may have to change your processes – we shall ensure that your Primary Liaison Point (<abbr title="Primary Liaison Point">PLP</abbr>) is kept informed. </p>

<h3 id="action-for-competent-authorities">Action for competent authorities</h3>

<p>You now need to check if your procedural rules or other requirements placed on service providers within scope comply with the Directive. The following flowcharts are designed to assist you with this process.</p>

<p>The first flowchart is for the screening of authorisation schemes that are imposed on service providers who want to establish in the UK. The second flowchart is for the screening of other requirements that are imposed on service providers operating in the UK, whether they are established here or are operating here without being established. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file53128.pdf">Services Directive screening guidance for competent authorities. Screening flowchart for authorisation schemes that are imposed on service providers who want to establish in the UK</a> </li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file53129.pdf">Services Directive screening guidance for competent authorities. Screening flowchart for requirements that are imposed on service providers operating in the UK (whether established in the UK or elsewhere)</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="screening-considerations">Screening considerations</h3>

<p>Many competent authorities will have responsibility for overseeing authorisation schemes or enforcing requirements which have been implemented in national legislation. Where this is the case, competent authorities should look for the relevant legislation in Document 2 - it should already have been screened and a decision made by the responsible department as to whether it is justified or if amendments are needed. </p>

<p>If you have responsibility for imposing your own requirements and authorisation schemes, or the relevant legislation is not shown on our list, then you will have to screen your requirements as explained in the flowcharts. </p>

<p>Some different considerations pertain to requirements applying to service providers seeking to establish in the UK, as opposed to those who want to provide services in the UK but do not want to establish in the UK. You should refer to the Services Directive Regulations, in particular regulations 14.1 to 14.2, 22.1 to 22.3 and 24.1 to 24.3, in order to ascertain the requirements applicable to each element of an authorisation scheme or other requirement. </p>

<p>One point to note is that the test for necessity is narrower in relation to service providers who are not seeking to establish in the UK. For such service providers, a ‘necessary’ requirement can only be justified on one or more of four specified grounds: public policy, public security, public health or protection of the environment. The specific meanings of these terms have been established by European case law; refer also to Recital 41 of the Directive. However, where a service provider intends to establish in the UK a ‘necessary’ requirement may be justified on wider grounds, by an ‘overriding reason relating to the public interest (ORRPI). This term is defined in Article 4(8) and explained fully in Recital 40 of <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_376/l_37620061227en00360068.pdf">EU Service Directive Final Text 27 December 2006</a>. </p>

<p>Please note that regulation 24 is not applicable to professional bodies already complying with the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications (MRPQ) Directive. If you fall into this category and your rules already comply with the MRPQ Directive, then you do not have to check whether they comply with regulation 24 and whether they can be imposed on service providers not seeking to establish in the UK. Other derogations to regulation 24 exist – please see regulation 25 for a full list. </p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/europe/docs/10-568-what-to-do-if-your-work-affects-service-businesses.pdf">What to do if your work affects service businesses: guidance for departments and competent authorities on the Provision of Service Regulations 2009</a>  </p>

<p>The Directive was brought into UK law by the Provision of Services Regulations 2009, which came into effect on the 28 December 2009. The Regulations affect a very wide range of service businesses. This guidance is aimed at those bodies who set rules or requirements which service providers have to comply with, and those who are involved in authorising service providers (ie ‘competent authorities’). These bodies include government departments, devolved administrations, local authorities, licensing and authorisation bodies and other authorities such as professional bodies or bodies who maintain required registers or deliver required training qualifications. The guidance contains user friendly flowcharts which will guide you through the steps that you need to take, and point you to the sections of the guidance that you will need to look at.</p>

<h3 id="screening-flowcharts-for-government-departments">Screening flowcharts for government departments</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> has been working with government departments and devolved administrations to ensure that national legislation is compliant with the Services Directive. The reviewing (or ‘screening’) of requirements that are derived from national legislation and imposed on service providers is now complete. Any requirements to be amended to comply with the Directive or justified under the terms of the Directive were reported by <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> to the EU Commission in December 2009.</p>

<p>However, screening will continue after this date for any proposed requirements, new requirements or changes in requirements affecting the access to, or the exercise of, a service activity. Such requirements will be reported on by <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> to the Commission as they arise.</p>

<p>This document provides updated guidance to help you through the steps involved in screening any (current or future) requirements that you impose on service providers for compliance with the Directive. Before attempting to use the flowcharts yourself it is advisable that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have read the following information </li>
  <li>have access to the ‘Documents to help Departments screen’ (see below) </li>
  <li>have read through the worked examples </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="background-to-screening">Background to screening</h3>

<p>The Directive aims to make it easier for businesses to provide services in all member states (EU countries). One way of doing this is by the removal of unjustifiable barriers to service provision. All requirements (for example authorisation schemes, licence applications, certification, registration processes, approval systems and continuing requirements) that are imposed on service providers must be screened to ensure that they are for example non-discriminatory, necessary and proportionate. Any requirements that cannot be justified under the terms of the Directive will need to be amended or abolished in order to be compliant with the Directive.</p>

<p>Document 3 below will show you whether legislation in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland has been screened and justified under the terms of the Directive or will be amended to comply with the Directive. </p>

<h3 id="action-for-departments">Action for Departments</h3>

<h4 id="screening-1">Screening</h4>

<p>The flowcharts together with the worked examples are designed to assist you in checking if your requirements (existing, new or amended requirements) placed on service providers within scope comply with the Directive.</p>

The second flowchart is for the screening of other requirements that are imposed on service providers operating in the UK, whether they are established here or are operating here without being established.</p>

<h4 id="screening-considerations-1">Screening considerations</h4>

<p>Some different considerations pertain to requirements applying to service providers seeking to establish in the UK, as opposed to those who want to provide services in the UK but do not want to establish in the UK. You should refer to the Provision of Services Regulations (which implement the Directive, see below) , in particular regulations 14.1 to 14.2, 22.1 to 22.3 and 24.1 to 24.3, in order to ascertain the requirements applicable to each element of an authorisation scheme or other requirement. One point to note is that the test for necessity is narrower in relation to service providers who are not seeking to establish in the UK. For such service providers, a ‘necessary’ requirement can only be justified on one or more of four specified grounds: a fundamental threat to public policy, public security, public health or protection of the environment. The specific meanings of these terms have been established by European case law; refer also to Recital 41 of the Directive (see link below). However, where a service provider intends to establish in the UK a ‘necessary’ requirement may be justified on wider grounds, by an ‘overriding reason relating to the public interest’ (ORRPI). This term is defined in Article 4(8) and explained fully in Recital 40 of the Directive (see link below).  </p>

<h4 id="checking-old-requirements-those-in-force-before-28-december-2009">Checking old requirements (those in force before 28 December 2009)</h4>

<p>All legislation which affects service providers should have been checked for compatibility with the Directive, so you may find that the legislation you enforce has already been screened by a government department. Legislation made before 28 December 2009 should feature on the list of screened legislation list. </p>

<h4 id="checking-new-requirements-those-in-force-after-28-december-2009">Checking new requirements (those in force after 28 December 2009)</h4>

<p>Government departments, devolved administrations, local authorities and other competent authorities must ensure that all new requirements (in force after December 28th 2009) imposed on service providers in the UK are compliant with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2009/uksi_20092999_en_1">Services Regulations</a></p>

<h4 id="reporting-requirements">Reporting requirements</h4>

<p>As a result of screening, you may need to complete a reporting form explaining why an in-scope requirement is non-discriminatory, suitable for obtaining the objective pursued (proportionate) and necessary. </p>

<p>These forms are required by the European Commission and must be sent to <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>, who will check them and send them to the Commission. </p>

<p>Please use Form A if the new requirement applies only to service providers established in the UK: <a rel="external" href="http://elmsportal.businesslink.gov.uk/media/435">Notification form A for established service providers</a> </p>

<p>Please use Form B if: 
1. The new requirement applies to cross border service providers 
2. The new requirement applies to cross border service providers and providers established in the UK. </p>

<h3 id="screening-2">Screening</h3>

<p>The Directive aims to make it easier for businesses to provide services in all member states (EU countries). One way of doing this is by the removal of unjustifiable barriers to service provision. All requirements (for example authorisation schemes and registration processes) which are imposed on service providers must be screened to ensure that they are for example non-discriminatory, necessary and proportionate. Any requirements that cannot be justified under the terms of the Directive will need to be amended or abolished in order to be compliant with the Directive. </p>

<h3 id="action-for-local-authorities">Action for local authorities</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> has been working with government departments and devolved administrations to ensure that National legislation is compliant with the Directive. Document 2 below is a list of authorisations within scope of the Directive, which <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> believes are managed by local authorities. Document 3 will show you whether central government has justified the relevant legislation in England, or plans to amend it. When the outcome of the screening processes in the devolved administrations is available we will let you know by updating the Services Directive website and notifying your <abbr title="Primary Liaison Point">PLP</abbr>. Later in the year we will also update the website with those authorisation schemes, authorisation scheme procedures or other requirements that the government views are not justified together with the amendments that are being made as a result to National legislation. Please look out for this information, so that you are aware of how you may have to change your processes – again, we shall ensure that your <abbr title="Primary Liaison Point">PLP</abbr> is kept informed. </p>

<h3 id="screening-at-a-local-level">Screening at a local level</h3>

<p>You now need to check if your locally used Acts, bylaws, procedural rules or other requirements placed on service providers within scope comply with the Directive. The following flowcharts together with the worked examples are designed to assist local authorities with this process:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51531.pdf">screening flowchart for authorisation schemes that are imposed on service providers established in another member state who want to establish in the UK</a></li>

  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file51535.doc">screening flowchart examples</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>The first flowchart is for the screening of authorisation schemes that are imposed on service providers established in another member State who want to establish in the UK. The second flowchart is for the screening of other requirements that are imposed on service providers operating in the UK, whether they are established here or are operating here without being established. You may find it beneficial to work with neighbouring councilswho have the same service provider requirements when using the flowcharts. </p>

<p>Where you have discretion under National legislation to impose requirements, for example, the treatment of certain fees or authorisation of certain establishments, <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> is discussing with LACORS whether we can jointly facilitate a small number of lead or champion Local Authority groups who would consider key common issues and then disseminate guidance to other local authorities. We will tell you shortly whether this will be the case. </p>

<h3 id="screening-considerations-2">Screening considerations</h3>

<p>Some different considerations pertain to requirements applying to service providers seeking to establish in the UK, as opposed to those who want to provide services in the UK but do not want to establish in the UK. You should refer to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/europe/eu-services-directive/legislation-and-implementation">Services Directive Regulations</a>, in particular regulations 14.1 to 14.2, 22.1 to 22.3 and 24.1 to 24.3, in order to ascertain the requirements applicable to each element of an authorisation scheme or other requirement. One point to note is that the test for necessity is narrower in relation to service providers who are not seeking to establish in the UK. For such service providers, a ‘necessary’ requirement can only be justified on one or more of four specified grounds: public policy, public security, public health or protection of the environment.  The specific meanings of these terms have been established by European case law; refer also to Recital 41 of the Directive (see link below). However, where a service provider intends to establish in the UK a ‘necessary’ requirement may be justified on wider grounds, by an ‘overriding reason relating to the public interest (ORRPI).  This term is defined in Article 4(8) and explained fully in Recital 40 of the Directive (see link below).</p>

<h2 id="the-choices-for-online-transactions">The choices for online transactions</h2>

<p>A requirement of the Services Directive is that service providers can apply online for licences, permits and so forth that are in the scope of the Directive.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> will let local authorities and other competent authorities meet this requirement in one of two ways.</p>

<p>If an authority offers its own online application process, the Point of Single Contact (<abbr title="Point of Single Contact">PSC</abbr>) will link to that online service. </p>

<p>In all other cases, <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> will supply an online application service as part of the <abbr title="Point of Single Contact">PSC</abbr>.</p>

<p>An authority can offer a mix of its own online applications and <abbr title="Department for Business Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>’s services for different procedures and change the mix over time, although for any one procedure it can only offer one or the other. </p>
