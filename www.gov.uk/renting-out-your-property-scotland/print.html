  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="landlord-responsibilities"><header><h1>Part 1: Landlord responsibilities</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to rent out your property in Scotland, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk" title="Scottish government: landlord registration">register as a landlord with the local council.</a> </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>It’s a criminal offence to rent out your property without being registered.</p>
</div>

<p>As a landlord, you have responsibilities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping your rented properties safe and free from health hazards</li>
  <li>making sure all <a rel="external" href="http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/renting_a_property/for_landlords.aspx" title="Gas Safe Register - advice for landlords">gas</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/electricity/maintenance/safety.htm" title="Electrical equipment safety requirements from the Health and Safety Executive">electrical equipment</a> you supply is safely installed and maintained</li>
  <li>following fire safety regulations - <a rel="external" href="http://www.lacors.gov.uk/lacors/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?id=19844" title="Download 'Housing: Fire safety' (PDF, 1.6MB)">download ‘Housing: Fire safety’ (PDF, 1.6MB)</a>
</li>
  <li>providing an <a href="/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates" title="Energy Performance Certificates">Energy Performance Certificate</a> for the property</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Housing/privaterent/government/SGTD1" title="Scottish government (Safeguarding tenancy deposits)">protecting your tenant’s deposit</a> in a government-approved scheme</li>
</ul>
<h2>Financial responsibilities</h2>

<p>You’ll have to pay Income Tax on your rental income, minus your day-to-day running expenses.</p>

<p>If you have a mortgage on the property you want to rent out, you must get permission from your mortgage lender.</p>


</article><article id="making-repairs"><header><h1>Part 2: Making repairs</h1>
  </header><p>You must keep your property in good condition. The ‘repairing standard’ in Scotland means you must make sure:</p>

<ul>
<li>the structure and exterior of the house are in reasonable repair</li>
  <li>water, gas, electricity, sanitation, heating and hot water equipment are all working and in reasonable condition</li>
  <li>any fixtures, fittings, appliances and furnishings you provide are all working and in reasonable condition</li>
</ul>
<h2>When you can enter the property</h2>

<p>You have a legal right to enter your property to inspect it or carry out repairs. You must give your tenants at least 24 hours’ notice, although immediate access may be possible in emergencies. Your tenants have the right to stay in the property during the repairs.</p>

<p>If your property is seriously damaged by a fire, flood or other similar incident, you don’t have to rebuild or renovate it. However, if you do, you can’t charge your tenants for any repairs made.</p>

<h2>Common areas</h2>

<p>If you own a block of flats, you’ll usually be responsible for repairing common areas, like staircases. Councils can ask landlords to fix problems in common areas, or to repair a tenant’s flat that has been damaged by another tenant.</p>

<h2>What happens if repairs aren’t done properly</h2>

<p>Tenants can apply to the <a href="/renting-out-your-property-scotland/settling-disputes" title="Settling disputes">Private Rented Housing Panel (PRHP)</a> if you refuse to carry out repairs, or if you don’t do them properly.</p>

<h2>If the property is temporarily unfit to live in</h2>

<p>You can ask tenants to move out during major repairs. Before this happens, you should agree in writing:</p>

<ul>
<li>how long the works will last</li>
  <li>the tenants’ right to return</li>
  <li>details of any alternative accommodation</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t repossess a property to do repairs. However, if you’re planning substantial works, or want to redevelop the property, you can apply to the courts for an order for your tenants to leave. The courts are more likely to grant this if you provide alternative accommodation.</p>

<h2>Repairs and charging rent</h2>
<p>If the repairs are very disruptive, your tenants may be able to claim a reduction on their rent known as a ‘rent abatement’. This will depend on how much of the property is unusable. </p>

<p>You may have the right to <a href="/renting-out-a-property-in-scotland/rent-increases" title="Rent increases">increase the rent</a> after carrying out repairs and improvements, depending on the tenancy agreement.</p>

</article><article id="rent-increases"><header><h1>Part 3: Rent increases</h1>
  </header><p>The tenancy agreement should include how and when you will review the rent.</p>

<h2>Assured and short assured tenancies</h2>
<p>For an assured or short assured tenancy, you can’t increase the rent during the fixed term unless there’s a clause in the tenancy agreement saying you can. </p>

<p>After the fixed term ends, for an assured tenancy you can increase the rent by:</p>

<ul>
<li>giving your tenant an <a rel="external" href="http://www.prhpscotland.gov.uk/prhp/files/AT2.pdf" title="Download 'AT2 notice' (PDF, 100KB)">AT2 notice</a> (PDF, 100KB) - you can only do this once a year</li>
  <li>giving your tenant an <a rel="external" href="http://www.prhpscotland.gov.uk/prhp/files/AT1L.pdf" title="Download 'AT1(L) notice' (PDF, 88KB)">AT1(L) notice</a> (PDF, 88KB) - after giving them a valid notice to quit</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must give your tenants at least 1 rental period’s notice before increasing the rent. For example, if they pay monthly you must give at least 1 month’s notice.</p>
</div>

<h2>Regulated tenancies</h2>
<p>For a regulated tenancy, if you want to increase the rent you must apply to Rent Service Scotland for a new fair rent registration. This must normally be at least 3 years since the last increase, unless either:</p>

<ul>
<li>you apply jointly with your tenant</li>
  <li>there has been a significant change to the property - like major repairs or improvements </li>
</ul>
<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1035/0063133.pdf" title="Download 'Form RR1: application for registration of a rent' (PDF, 13KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Form RR1: application for a registration of rent’ (PDF, 13KB)</a></p>
</div>

<p>Your tenant can appeal to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.prhpscotland.gov.uk/" title="Private Rented Housing Panel">Private Rented Housing Panel</a> if they think that a rent increase is unreasonable. </p>

</article><article id="settling-disputes"><header><h1>Part 4: Settling disputes</h1>
  </header><p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.prhpscotland.gov.uk/prhp/135.26.30.html" title="Private Rented Housing Panel">Private Rented Housing Panel (<abbr title="Private Rented Housing Panel">PRHP</abbr>)</a> is responsible for settling disputes about rent and repairs. The <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/sheriff/index.asp" title="Sheriff courts">courts</a> are responsible for evictions, damages and other issues.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It’s usually quicker and easier if you can resolve issues with your tenants informally.</p>
</div>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Speak to your tenants about your concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this doesn’t work, write a formal letter explaining the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact the <abbr title="Private Rented Housing Panel">PRHP</abbr> or start legal action through the courts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Private Rented Housing Panel (<abbr title="Private Rented Housing Panel">PRHP</abbr>)</h2>

<p>If your dispute is about rent or repairs, you can apply to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.prhpscotland.gov.uk/prhp/135.26.30.html" title="Private Rented Housing Panel"><abbr title="Private Rented Housing Panel">PRHP</abbr>.</a></p>

<p>After you apply to the <abbr title="Private Rented Housing Panel">PRHP</abbr>, both you and your tenant will be asked if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you want the case to be heard formally</li>
  <li>you want to submit written statements</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, you’ll both be able to comment on what the other person says. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Private Rented Housing Panel">PRHP</abbr> may also send someone to look at your property, especially if the dispute is about repairs.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Private Rented Housing Panel">PRHP</abbr> believes that the disagreement between you and your tenant over repairs can be resolved with some help, it may suggest mediation. This is a free service and can be quicker than a formal hearing. </p>

<p>For mediation to happen, both you and your tenant must agree to it.</p>

<h2>Going to court</h2>
<p>If you decide to take legal action, you’ll normally apply to a <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/sheriff/index.asp" title="Sheriff courts">sheriff court.</a> </p>

<p>If you want to claim:</p>

<ul>
<li>£3000 or less - you’ll need to make a <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/sheriff/small_claims/guidance_notes.asp" title="Scottish courts (Small claims guidance notes)">small claims action</a>
</li>
  <li>£3001 - £5000 - you’ll need to raise a <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/sheriff/summary_cause/guidance_notes.asp" title="Scottish courts (Summary cause guidance notes)">summary cause action</a>
</li>
  <li>£5001 and over - you’ll need to raise an <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/library/rules/ordinarycause/index.asp" title="Scottish courts (Ordinary cause rules)">ordinary cause action</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Free advice for disputes</h2>

<p>You can get free advice about disputes or housing problems from <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice/" title="Citizens Advice Bureau">Citizens Advice</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice" title="Shelter Scotland">Shelter Scotland.</a></p>

<p>A solicitor can also help you, but they might charge a fee.</p>

<p>If you have to go to court, you can get advice on the day of the hearing from the housing duty desk at the court.</p>


</article><article id="houses-in-multiple-occupation-hmo"><header><h1>Part 5: Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO)</h1>
  </header><p>Your property is a ‘House in Multiple Occupation’ (<abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr>) if:</p>

<ul>
<li>at least 3 tenants live there, forming more than 1 household</li>
  <li>toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities are shared</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A household consists of either a single person or members of the same family who live together. It includes people who are married or living together and people in same-sex relationships.</p>
</div>

<h2>Licences</h2>

<p>All HMOs in Scotland must be licensed. You apply for an <abbr title="House in Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr> licence to your local council. </p>


</article><article id="paying-tax"><header><h1>Part 6: Paying tax</h1>
  </header><p>When you start renting out property, you must tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). You can be fined if you don’t.</p>

<p>Call the Self Assessment Helpline if you need to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> about your business.</p>

</div>

<h2>Working out your profits</h2>
<p>When working out the profits from renting out your property for tax purposes, you can’t deduct the cost of:</p>

<ul>
<li>buying the property</li>
  <li>altering or improving property</li>
  <li>depreciation</li>
  <li>any losses when you sell the property</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, you may be able to claim tax allowances called <a href="/capital-allowances" title="Capital allowances">capital allowances</a>.</p>

<h2>Capital allowances</h2>
<p>There are different types of allowance you can claim against the cost of buying or replacing things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>furniture</li>
  <li>fixtures and fittings (eg cupboards, plumbing and electrical installations)</li>
  <li>equipment you need to run your business (eg a computer or stationery)</li>
  <li>equipment that isn’t just for the use of a single let property, like a new fire alarm system for a block of flats</li>
</ul>
<h3>What you can claim</h3>
<p>For furniture and equipment provided with a furnished residential letting, you can claim either:</p>

<ul>
<li>10% of the net rent as a ‘wear and tear allowance’ - net rent is the rent received, less any costs you pay that a tenant would usually pay (eg Council Tax)</li>
  <li>the cost of replacing furniture or equipment, including small items like cutlery</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve chosen which of these allowances to claim for a property, you can’t switch between them from year to year. </p>

</div>

<h2>Other expenses</h2>
<p>As well as capital allowances, you can also claim for some ‘allowable expenses’ (money you need to spend in the running of your business), such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>letting agent’s fees</li>
  <li>legal fees for lets of a year or less, or for renewing a lease for less than 50 years</li>
  <li>accountant’s fees</li>
  <li>buildings and contents insurance</li>
  <li>interest on property loans</li>
  <li>maintenance and repairs to the property (but not improvements)</li>
  <li>utility bills such as gas, water and electricity</li>
  <li>rent, ground rent, service charges</li>
  <li>Council Tax</li>
  <li>services you pay for, such as cleaning or gardening</li>
  <li>other direct costs of letting the property, such as phone calls, stationery and advertising</li>
</ul>
<h2>Losses</h2>
<p>If you make a loss on renting, you can carry it forward to a later year and offset it against future profits.</p>

<h2>How to claim</h2>
<p>You claim through either your:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns/overview" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Income Tax Self Assessment</a></li>
