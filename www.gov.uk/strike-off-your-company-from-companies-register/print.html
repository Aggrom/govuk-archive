  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can close down your limited company by getting it ‘struck off’ the Companies Register, but only if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>is solvent</li>
  <li>has paid all of its debts</li>
  <li>hasn’t traded or sold off any stock in the last 3 months</li>
  <li>hasn’t changed names in the last 3 months</li>
  <li>isn’t threatened with liquidation</li>
  <li>has no agreements with creditors eg a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your company doesn’t meet these conditions, you’ll have to voluntarily <a href="/liquidate-your-company" title="liquidate your company">liquidate your company</a> instead.</p>
</div>

<h2>Before closing your company</h2>

<p>When you apply to ‘strike off’ your company, you have certain responsibilities to <a href="/strike-off-your-company-from-companies-register/directors-responsibilities" title="Directors' responsibilities when closing a company">wind up your business properly</a>.</p>

</article><article id="directors-responsibilities"><header><h1>Part 2: Directors' responsibilities</h1>
  </header><p>Before applying to strike off your limited company, you must make sure you’ve closed it down legally.</p>

<h2>Who you must tell</h2>

<p>You must send a copy of the <a href="/strike-off-your-company-from-companies-register/apply-to-strike-off" title="Applying to strike off your company">application to strike off</a> within 7 days to anyone who could be affected. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>members (usually the shareholders) </li>
  <li>creditors </li>
  <li>employees </li>
  <li>managers or trustees of any employee pension fund </li>
  <li>any directors who didn’t sign the application form</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you don’t follow the rules on who you must tell, you can face a fine and possible prosecution.</p>
</div>

<h2>Employees</h2>

<p>If your company employs staff, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>follow the rules if you make staff redundant</li>
  <li>pay their final wages or salary</li>
</ul>
<h2>PAYE and National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>)</h2>

<p>You’ll need to tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) that your company has stopped trading and will soon be dissolved. </p>

<p>Once you’ve paid the final balance of PAYE and <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>, ask <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to close down the company’s payroll scheme.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> employer helpline</strong>   </p>

<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> 08457 143 143<br>
Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm<br>
Saturday, 8am to 4pm</p>
</div>

<h2>Business assets</h2>

<p>You should make sure that any business assets are shared among the shareholders before the company is struck off.</p>

<p>Anything that’s left will go to the Crown – you’ll have to <a href="/restore-your-dissolved-company" title="restore the company">restore the company</a> to get anything back.</p>

<h2>Final accounts</h2>

<p>You must send final statutory accounts and a Company Tax Return to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. </p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Prepare your <a href="/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/file-your-accounts-and-company-tax-return" title="Prepare your final accounts">final accounts</a> and <a href="/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/prepare-a-company-tax-return" title="prepare your company tax return">company tax return</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company/file-your-accounts-and-company-tax-return" title="file accounts and tax return">File your accounts and company tax return</a>, stating that these are the final trading accounts and that the company will soon be dissolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay all Corporation Tax and any other outstanding tax liabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’ve made a loss in your final year of trading, you might be able to offset the tax against profits from previous years – this is known as ‘terminal loss relief’. You can claim this on your final tax return.</p>
</div>

<h2>Capital Gains Tax on personal profits</h2>

<p>If you take assets out of the company before it’s struck off, you might have to pay <a href="/capital-gains-tax" title="Capital Gains Tax">Capital Gains Tax</a> on the amount. </p>

<p>You might be able to get tax relief on this through <a href="/entrepreneurs-relief" title="entrepreneurs relief">entrepreneurs relief</a>.</p>

<p>You will work this out on your personal <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="self assessment tax return">Self Assessment tax return</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the amount is worth more than £25,000, it will be treated as income and you’ll have to pay income tax on it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Keeping records</h2>

<p>You must keep business documents for 7 years after the company was struck off. This includes bank statements, invoices, receipts etc.  </p>

<p>If the company employed people, you must keep copies of its employers’ liability insurance policy and schedule for 40 years from the date the company was dissolved.</p>


</article><article id="apply-to-strike-off"><header><h1>Part 3: Apply to strike off</h1>
  </header><p>To apply to strike off your limited company, you must send Companies House form DS01.</p>

<p>The form must be signed by a majority of the company’s directors. </p>

<p>It costs £10 to strike off a company.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/forms/generalForms/DS01_striking_off_application_by_a_company.pdf" title="Download 'Form DS01' (PDF, 349KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Form DS01’ (PDF, 349KB)</a></p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you make a dishonest application, you can face a fine and possible prosecution.</p>
</div>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>You’ll get a letter from Companies House to let you know if you’ve filled in the form correctly. If it has, your request to be struck off will be published in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk">official ‘Gazette’ for your region</a>. </p>

<p>If nobody objects, the company will be struck off the register within 3 months. It will be dissolved once a second notice is published in the gazzette - this means it won’t legally exist.</p>

<h2>Withdrawing your application</h2>

<p>If your company stops being eligible to be struck off you must withdraw the application. To do this, send form DS02 to Companies House. Only 1 director needs to sign it. </p>

</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can also use this form to withdraw the application if you change your mind about striking off your company.</p>
</div>
