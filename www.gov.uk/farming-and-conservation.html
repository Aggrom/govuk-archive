<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The protection and improvement of the environment is encouraged in several ways in the UK. There are legal requirements of farmers and land managers, good-practice expectations under various schemes, as well as public and local community demands for environmental and social benefits.</p>

<p>Conservation issues affect every aspect of farming. This guide explains the areas of concern and interest for farmers and land managers, legal requirements for environmental management, as well as information on the various schemes and support available.</p>

<p>This guide also introduces the basics of protecting and enhancing the natural environment, including farm land use and management, public access, encouraging biodiversity, protecting species and habitats, and helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h2 id="farm-land-use-and-management">Farm land use and management</h2>

<p>Cross compliance is a system of standards and requirements that farmers must meet in order to qualify for payments under certain Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) schemes, including the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>). It consists of both regulatory requirements and ‘best practice’ standards for environmental management in farming. It is made up of two main elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>) - these are European legal requirements on issues relating to environmental, public, animal and plant health, and animal welfare. For more information, see the guide on Statutory Management Requirements (SMR).</li>
  <li>Statutory requirements to maintain your land in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr>) - including maintaining habitats and landscape that are important to the English countryside. For more information, see the guide on standards of GAEC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the guide on cross compliance: the basics.</p>

<p>The regulations governing your land use and management have changed over the years in a number of areas, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>grazing</li>
  <li>use of fertilisers</li>
  <li>use of pesticides</li>
  <li>soil management</li>
  <li>burning of heather and grasses</li>
</ul>
<p>Environmental Impact Assessments (<abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIAs</abbr>) are formal processes that aim to protect semi-natural or uncultivated land from damage caused by farming - for example, by reducing fertiliser usage or improving soil quality. For more information, read the guide on EIAs).</p>

<p>New regulations, processes and best-practice guidance have been published to encourage more efficient ways of doing business between you and the government, and improve the quality of your farming.</p>

<h3 id="grazing">Grazing</h3>

<p>It is important to protect habitats that contain natural or semi-natural vegetation by preventing overgrazing and unsuitable supplementary feeding. This is set out in the <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 9 standard, which applies to you if you keep livestock on natural or semi-natural vegetation. You must also comply with any written directions in relation to your land about overgrazing, sent to you on behalf of the Secretary of State. Breaches of these directions can result in fines.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=249953&amp;id=250006">View the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) guidance on the requirements of <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 9 - overgrazing and unsuitable supplementary feeding on the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>The practice of ‘conservation grazing’ using livestock meets nature conservation objectives and can include everything from semi-feral herds of ponies in hilly regions to the use of commercial livestock breeds in the lowlands.</p>

<p>For more information, read the guide on grazing and pasture.</p>

<h3 id="fertilisers">Fertilisers</h3>

<p>Fertilisers and manures are used to replenish the nutrient status in soils. The most commonly used fertilisers contain nitrogen, phosphate, sulphur, potash, a compound known as potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and magnesium. Lime is also applied to correct soil acidity. However, there are a number of voluntary and statutory controls on fertilisers to ensure that they are stored safely and that the risk of pollution is minimised, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>safety, import and export policy - due to the potential terrorist threat of fertiliser products with a high nitrogen content, there are stringent controls in place for the use and storage of fertilisers on farms</li>
  <li>fertiliser and manure management - there are national standards for the use of fertilisers in order to reduce the risk of nutrient pollution - <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=262994&amp;id=263028">view <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on nutrient management and fertiliser use on the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>
</li>
  <li>minimising pollution - read the guides on air pollution on farms and water pollution on farms</li>
  <li>cross compliance - see the guide on cross compliance: the basics</li>
  <li>Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (<abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>)- see the guide on NVZs)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.agindustries.org.uk/content.output/680/680/Fertilisers/Publications%20and%20Reports/Health%20and%20Safety.mspx">read fertiliser guidelines and best practice on the Agricultural Industries Confederation (<abbr title="Agricultural Industries Confederation">AIC</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pesticides">Pesticides</h3>

<p>There are strict regulations on the sale, supply, storage, advertising and use of plant protection products (<abbr title="plant protection products">PPPs</abbr>) - commonly known as pesticides - in order to protect users, consumers and the environment. The Pesticides Safety Directorate (<abbr title="Pesticides Safety Directorate">PSD</abbr>) is the government agency responsible for overseeing their use and enforcing these regulations.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/">Read information about the <abbr title="Pesticides Safety Directorate">PSD</abbr> on the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>Before you use a pesticide, you must be sure that it is approved for the job you’ll be doing. It is a legal requirement that professional users of <abbr title="plant protection products">PPPs</abbr> must be adequately trained, and that the product labels of <abbr title="plant protection products">PPPs</abbr> are strictly followed.</p>

<p>If you plan to use pesticides or store them for sale, you must have properly trained staff to do so. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.nptc.org.uk/">find advice and training courses for a Certificate of Competence for using pesticides on the City and Guilds NTPC website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.basis-reg.com/">Read information about the Certificate of Competence for storing and selling pesticides on the BASIS website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/guidance/industries/pesticides/topics/using-pesticides/codes-of-practice/code-of-practice-for-using-plant-protection-products">Find out about the plant protection products code of practice on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are receiving payments under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> or other Common Agricultural Policy scheme, you will also need to comply with the Statutory Management Requirement (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr>) 9 - restrictions on the use of <abbr title="plant protection products">PPPs</abbr>. This standard aims to ensure that <abbr title="plant protection products">PPPs</abbr> are used correctly and their risk to humans, animals and the environment is kept to a minimum. You cannot use a pesticide unless it’s been approved under relevant legislation.</p>

<h3 id="heather-and-grass-burning">Heather and grass burning</h3>

<p>According to the standards of <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 10, moorland and heathland landscapes and habitats must be properly maintained. This standard applies to you if you are planning to carry out heather or grass burning on your land.</p>

<p>You must not burn gorse, heather, rough grass, bracken or Vaccinium shrub species outside the burning season, except under a licence issued by Natural England. You also need to take all reasonable cautions to prevent injury or damage to people or adjacent land before, during and after the burning. You should also have enough people and equipment to control the burning during the entire period of the burn.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=249953&amp;id=250007">View <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on the requirements of <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 10 - heather and grass burning on the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also see the guide on heather and grass burning.</p>

<h3 id="soil-management">Soil management</h3>

<p>There are requirements under <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 1 - Soil Protection Review to manage the structure and organic matter of the soil on your land and to reduce the risks of erosion.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/d43cda386642048280257800003ef0d1/%24FILE/The%20Guide%20to%20Cross%20Compliance%20in%20England%202011%20edition.pdf">Download guidance on the requirements of <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 1 - SPR from the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website (PDF, 363K)</a>.</p>

<p>As well as observing cross compliance requirements you must also be careful to avoid soil erosion and overgrazing. This can be more commonplace in upland areas, depending on the soils, climate and landscape. Peat soils and steep-sloping land can have the most severe erosion. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=193719&amp;id=193720">Download <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on controlling soil erosion from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 819K)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hill-farming">Hill farming</h2>

<p>The uplands are a difficult environment for farming and need to be carefully managed. Hill farming is a specialised profession, and it takes careful management to ensure a productive, sustainable farm.</p>

<p><abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessments">EIAs</abbr> will help you control your grazing management and maintain the quality and species of vegetation in your upland areas. See the guide on EIAs.</p>

<p>There is financial help available for farmers through government-sponsored compensation schemes such as the Hill Farm Allowance. This scheme is overseen by the Rural Payments Agency as part of the Rural Development Programme for England (<abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr>) 2007-2013.</p>

<p>From July 2010, Natural England will administer The Uplands Entry Level Scheme which will replace the Hill Farm Allowance (HFA). This is a new category of Entry Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The Uplands <abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr> is open to all farmers and land managers in SDAs (Severely Disadvantaged Areas). It will reward farmers and land managers for continuing with and adopting farming practices that conserve the upland landscape and natural environment.</p>

<p>For more information, read the guide on hill farming, Entry Level Stewardship (ELS).</p>

<h2 id="countryside-conservation">Countryside conservation</h2>

<p>Farm support schemes have moved away from production-only based payments to stewardship of the environment and support for other sustainable activities.</p>

<p>The conservation of the rural environment is a main focus of both <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and Natural England. There are several ways that farmers and land managers can work alongside these organisations to help conserve the landscape features of the countryside and improve public access to it.</p>

<h3 id="common-land">Common land</h3>

<p>Common land contributes to our landscape’s beauty, character and history.</p>

<p>If you own common land, your rights are subject to statutory controls and the commoners’ interests. As the rules governing the rights to common land are a balance between the interests of the owner and those of the commoners, historically there have been problems with the management of common land. In response to this, the government has introduced legislation which enables common land to be managed more sustainably.</p>

<p>For more information, read the guide on common land.</p>

<h3 id="public-rights-of-way">Public rights of way</h3>

<p>Public rights of way (<abbr title="'public rights of way'">PROWs</abbr>) provide many opportunities for people to enjoy the natural environment. They are legal highways that anyone can use at any time, even if they cross privately owned land. For more information, see the related guide on public rights of way.</p>

<h3 id="hedgerows">Hedgerows</h3>

<p>According to <abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr> 14 and 15, you need to protect hedgerows on your land, especially when they provide habitats for nesting birds. If you have hedgerows growing in, or adjacent to, any of your land or near watercourses, these <abbr title="(Standards of) Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr> will apply to you.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=249953&amp;id=250012">View <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on the requirements of <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 15 - hedgerows on the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to remove a hedgerow, you will have to notify your local authority in writing and receive written permission to carry out the removal. You should receive a reply from them within 42 days.</p>

<p>You must not cut or trim any hedgerow on your land between 1 March and 31 July inclusive each year, as this is the main breeding season for birds. However, there may be an exception to this rule, for example, if the hedgerow:</p>

<ul>
<li>overhangs a highway, road or footpath and can obstruct vehicles, pedestrians or horse riders</li>
  <li>is dead, diseased, damaged or insecurely rooted and is likely to cause danger by falling on to a road, highway or footpath</li>
  <li>needs hedge-laying or coppicing during the period of 1 March to 30 April inclusive</li>
  <li>has been laid within six months and needs trimming</li>
</ul>
<p>Important hedgerows are protected from removal by the Hedgerows Regulations 1997.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/regulation/hedgeregs/default.aspx">Read advice for managing your hedgerows on the Natural England website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="drystone-walls">Drystone walls</h3>

<p>The standards of <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 13 encourage the maintenance and retention of drystone walls as an important landscape feature. These apply to you if you have drystone walls on your land.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=249953&amp;id=250010">View <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on the requirements of <abbr title="'good agricultural and environmental condition'">GAEC</abbr> 13 - stone walls on the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You must not remove a stone wall from your land, or a stone from a stone wall on your land. However, there are exceptions to this rule, for example, if you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>widen an existing gateway in a wall to enable access for livestock or machinery - the gateway should be no wider than ten metres</li>
  <li>repair another stone wall on your land that’s in a better condition than the one from which a stone is removed</li>
  <li>make minor repairs to a public footpath</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biodiversity">Biodiversity</h2>

<p>Biodiversity refers to all plant and animal species and the habitats they live in. In the UK, these can be affected by climate change, competition from non-native species, loss of habitat or poor habitat management.</p>

<p>The government’s strategy for conserving biodiversity is set out in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, which aims to:</p>

<ul>
<li>protect wildlife sites</li>
  <li>promote the recovery of declining species and habitats</li>
  <li>encourage biodiversity through official policy</li>
  <li>encourage people to become involved in conservation schemes</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264273&amp;id=264274">Download Natural England guidance on conserving biodiversity from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 315K)</a></p>

<p>Nationally important sites for biodiversity are protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>), and Natural England can advise on their management. For more information, see the guide on SSSI and historical monuments.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> aims to minimise the negative impacts of farming and agriculture on the natural habitats for wildlife in the UK through various schemes, such as Environmental Stewardship, which is administered by Natural England.</p>

<p>Natural England also gives advice on a range of wildlife management issues and issues licences under a range of wildlife legislation. For more information, read the guide on managing and conserving wildlife.</p>

<p>For more information on the control and protection of various species of wildlife in the UK, see the guides on wild birds, wild mammals and wild plants.</p>

<h2 id="climate-change-and-land-management">Climate change and land management</h2>

<p>Climate change is viewed as a serious, long-term challenge by the UK government, and farmers will be among the first to feel the full impacts, as the potential increase of temperatures and changing rainfall patterns will affect crop yields and increase the risks of pests and diseases. As such, farmers have a responsibility to manage their land in environmentally responsible ways.</p>

<p>The European Union’s (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s) Common Agricultural Policy provides financial support to farmers for a number of farming, environmental and rural development activities.</p>

<p>One area of focus for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation has been on agricultural emissions. Carbon emissions come mainly from animals’ digestive processes and wastes, fertilizer use and land-use change. The erosion or drainage of peat and fenland soils, along with the use of fossil fuels in agriculture, can also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, while there are regulations that affect farmers by aiming to control these emissions, there are also opportunities for new crops and businesses as a result of climate change.</p>

<p>For example, as a part of the aim to reduce greenhouse gases, farmers are encouraged to produce biogas from anaerobic digestion, which captures methane from organic wastes like slurries and manures. Doing so can also reduce waste costs for farmers.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/">using renewable energy</a>.</p>

<p>Farmers are also being encouraged to grow energy crops. These are used as a substitute for fossil fuels, so they can contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and help to combat climate change.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> works to implement air-quality standards across the UK. This includes the monitoring of CO2 emissions and ammonia levels, as well as encouraging farmers and land managers to use environmentally responsible practices. For more information, see the guides on air pollution on farms and air, water and soil quality: the basics.</p>

<h2 id="land-management-schemes">Land management schemes</h2>

<p>There are various land and conservation schemes in the UK that aim to protect the countryside, as well as the species and their habitats within it.</p>

<p>Environmental Stewardship provides funding to farmers and other land managers in England who deliver effective environmental management on their land under a wide range of options. The main objectives of this scheme are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>conserve biodiversity</li>
  <li>maintain and enhance the quality and character of the landscape</li>
  <li>protect the historic environment</li>
  <li>protect natural resources</li>
  <li>promote public access to the countryside</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three components of the Environmental Stewardship Scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entry Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>) - is open to all farmers and landowners, and promotes good stewardship of the countryside through effective land management beyond <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> requirements to maintain land in good agricultural and environmental condition. See the guide on [<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>)(http://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/admin/specialist-guides/4071).</li>
  <li>Organic Entry Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Organic Entry Level Stewardship">OELS</abbr>) - is targeted at organic or organic/conventional mixed-farming systems. It is only open to farmers not receiving Organic Farming Scheme aid. See the guide on OELS.</li>
  <li>Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>) - involves more complex types of land management, where farmers and land managers need further advice and support. <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> applications are much more detailed and are assessed against specific local targets. See the guide on HLS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Campaign for the Farmed Environment (<abbr title="Campaign for the Farmed Environment">CFE</abbr>) is a voluntary initiative to encourage farmers and land managers to adopt important land practices that replicate the environmental benefits formerly provided by set-aside to avoid regulation. <a rel="external" href="http://www.cfeonline.org.uk/">Read about the <abbr title="Campaign for the Farmed Environment">CFE</abbr> and its objectives on the <abbr title="Campaign for the Farmed Environment">CFE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>The English Woodland Grant Scheme (<abbr title="English Woodland Grant Scheme">EWGS</abbr>) aims to encourage woodland creation and management of existing woodlands, and is available to all private landowners.</p>

<p>Before applying for an <abbr title="English Woodland Grant Scheme">EWGS</abbr>, you and your land must be registered on the Customer Register and the Rural Land Register. For more information, see the guide on registering your land.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=122813&amp;id=122814">find <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s customer and land registration information on the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>.</p>
