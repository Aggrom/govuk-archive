<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The paper and cardboard industry can cause significant pollution. The industry includes paper and paperboard manufacturers, and businesses that produce paper and paperboard products. It also includes businesses that carry out finishing activities, such as coating, covering, laminating and embossing paper or cardboard.</p>

<p>Your activities may cause air pollution from dust and fumes, water pollution from contaminated discharges or run-off, noise pollution from materials handling and deliveries to your site, and land contamination from accidental spills of solvents.</p>

<p>This guide describes your responsibilities for preventing pollution to air, land and water. It includes guidance on noise and vibration, cooling towers, vehicle emissions, vehicle cleaning and car parks. It also covers how to prevent and deal with pollution incidents.</p>

<h2 id="air-pollution-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Air pollution responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p>Paper and cardboard businesses can emit dust, smoke, fumes and gases which affect air quality. Emissions to air include:</p>

<ul>
<li>oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur (SOx) and carbon (COx) from combustion plant or liquor burning</li>
  <li>particulates and dust from combustion or paper handling</li>
  <li>formaldehydes and ammonia from wet strength resins</li>
  <li>solvents from cleaning or coating processes</li>
  <li>chloroform from the use of chlorine compounds in bleaching</li>
  <li>odorous substances from wet pulping or effluent treatment plants</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comply-with-your-permit-conditions">Comply with your permit conditions</h3>

<p>If your business has an environmental permit, you must meet the conditions it contains.</p>

<p>Your permit may contain conditions relating to odour and emissions to air, including controls on substances such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>halogens, eg chlorine, fluorine and bromine-containing substances</li>
  <li>NOx</li>
  <li>particulates, eg PM10 and dust</li>
  <li>SOx</li>
  <li>volatile organic compounds, eg formaldehyde</li>
</ul>
<p>See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.s=tl&amp;topicId=1087477593">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production</a>.</p>

<p>If you use organic solvents, you must comply with further requirements. See the page on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087477121&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;type=RESOURCES">solvent use responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers</a> in our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.s=tl&amp;topicId=1087463934">waste and hazardous substance responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-causing-a-nuisance">Avoid causing a nuisance</h3>

<p>You must ensure that your activities do not create levels of dust, smoke or odour that could cause a nuisance to the surrounding community. If you do cause a nuisance, your local authority can:</p>

<ul>
<li>impose restrictions on your operations</li>
  <li>stop your operations</li>
  <li>require you to take steps to reduce the nuisance</li>
</ul>
<p>See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1086041496">noise, odour and other nuisances</a>.</p>

<h3 id="meet-boiler-and-chimney-requirements">Meet boiler and chimney requirements</h3>

<p>If you operate a boiler, you are likely to have to meet tight controls on its emissions to air.</p>

<p>You must not cause or allow a chimney or bonfire on your site to emit dark smoke. There are some exemptions from this requirement, but only if your installation won’t cause emissions that could damage health or cause a nuisance.</p>

<p>See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1080460523">preventing air pollution</a>.</p>

<h3 id="check-for-ozone-depleting-substances-ods-or-fluorinated-gases-f-gases">Check for ozone-depleting substances (ODS) or fluorinated gases (F-gases)</h3>

<p>In most circumstances, you must not use ODS for any degreasing or solvent application. ODS include:</p>

<ul>
<li>hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)</li>
  <li>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li>
  <li>1,1,1-trichloroethane</li>
  <li>bromochloromethane</li>
  <li>carbon tetrachloride</li>
</ul>
<p>F-gases are powerful gases that contribute to climate change. Common F-gas uses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in buildings and vehicles</li>
  <li>solvents</li>
  <li>firefighting and fire protection equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>If your business uses or handles F-gases or equipment that contains them, you must comply with special controls.</p>

<p>See our guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-fluorinated-gases-and-ozone-depleting-substances">managing fluorinated gases and ozone-depleting substances</a>.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>To reduce dust, odours and fumes you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>establish systems to monitor, measure, control and minimise dust emissions</li>
  <li>damp down areas of your site that give rise to dust (particularly in dry weather), but don’t allow run-off to enter surface water drains</li>
  <li>extract and filter dust-contaminated air during finishing</li>
  <li>install chemical recovery systems to capture chemicals in exhaust gases</li>
  <li>use filtered extraction hoods on paper machines to prevent emissions of odorous substances</li>
  <li>remove water vapour with a ventilator to prevent emissions of hazardous substances in the water vapour</li>
  <li>use low NOx burners if you have combustion plant</li>
  <li>keep covers on chemical containers to prevent odour and stop the escape of potentially harmful vapours and fumes - this may also save you money by reducing loss of materials through evaporation</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce the risk of harmful chemical emissions you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce the use of bleaching chemicals by extending cooking and oxygen delignification</li>
  <li>use brightening techniques that do not dissolve the lignin when bleaching mechanical pulp or recovered mechanical pulp - this will reduce the chemical oxygen demand of water in the manufacturing process</li>
  <li>use chlorine-free techniques that do not use sulphur compounds when bleaching chemical or recovered chemical pulp</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="noise-pollution-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Noise pollution responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p>Paper and cardboard businesses may create noise by:</p>

<ul>
<li>operating large processing plant and machinery, eg compressors, vacuum pumps and ventilators</li>
  <li>moving materials and goods to and from the site</li>
  <li>using vehicles on the site, especially if they have reversing alarms</li>
</ul>
<p>Your activities can also create vibration. Noise nuisance also covers vibration and both are controlled at the same time.</p>

<p>If noise or vibration from your activities causes a nuisance to the surrounding community, your local authority can limit your operations or even stop you from working. They can restrict:</p>

<ul>
<li>the machinery you use</li>
  <li>your working hours</li>
  <li>noise levels from your premises</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a permit or exemption and you breach noise conditions the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you. If you do not address a noise problem you could face legal action and a fine.</p>

<p>You must comply with any noise conditions set out in the planning approval for your site.</p>

<h3 id="register-your-burglar-alarms">Register your burglar alarms</h3>

<p>If your business is located in an alarm notification area you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>register your burglar alarm with your local authority</li>
  <li>provide the details of a person who holds the keys</li>
  <li>ensure the key holder knows how to use the alarm system</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be fined if you do not register. Contact your local authority to find out if your business is in an alarm notification area.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1074537118">Find contact details for your local authority through our Contacts Directory</a>.</p>

<h3 id="protect-your-employees-from-loud-noise">Protect your employees from loud noise</h3>

<p>Loud noise can cause irreversible hearing damage. You must protect your employees’ hearing.</p>

<h3 id="check-your-permit-conditions">Check your permit conditions</h3>

<p>If you have an environmental permit or a waste exemption, it may contain conditions that control emissions, such as noise. You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.</p>

<p>See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.s=tl&amp;topicId=1087477593">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production</a>.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-1">Good practice</h3>

<p>Carry out noisy activities away from areas where noise may cause a nuisance. Position noisy equipment away from your site boundary. You can use existing buildings to shield the noise source.</p>

<p>Make sure your buildings have adequate soundproofing. Shutting your doors and windows will also reduce noise. Use solid panelled fencing around your site instead of wire fences. This can help to screen the source and reduce the level of noise from your site.</p>

<p>Keep external doors and loading bays closed when they are not in use. For example, fit automatic closing devices to help prevent excess noise causing a nuisance to your neighbours.</p>

<p>Chipping and pulping operations can be extremely noisy. If you carry out these activities you should do so in a section of your building that has adequate soundproofing or acoustic dampening to minimise the impact of the noise.</p>

<p>Reduce noise from your equipment and vehicles by servicing them regularly. Consider fitting noise-reducing devices, and when you replace equipment consider buying quieter alternatives.</p>

<p>You should regularly monitor noise from your site, when it is fully working and also when it is shut down. This will give you an idea of the impact of your work on noise levels in the surrounding community. Monitoring will also help you identify any change in noise levels. If you are in any doubt about noise levels, you should get advice from a noise expert.</p>

<p>Limit noisy activities to daylight hours as noise is more likely to be a nuisance at night.</p>

<p>If you operate a night shift, move materials into the work area during the day or early evening. This will reduce the risk of complaints from the local community.</p>

<p>If you receive a complaint make sure you deal with it properly.

<h2 id="cooling-tower-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers">Cooling tower responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers</h2>

<p>If your business has air-conditioned offices or carries out a manufacturing process that uses water as a coolant, you may have a cooling tower.</p>

<p>Cooling towers remove heat from circulating cooling water systems, so that the water can be recirculated. The heat removed from the water is released to the atmosphere.</p>

<h3 id="register-your-cooling-tower">Register your cooling tower</h3>

<p>If you have a cooling tower or an evaporative condenser, you must notify your local authority. You must also tell them if you make any changes to your cooling tower or if you stop using it. Ask your local authority’s environmental health department for a cooling tower registration or notification form.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-3">Good practice</h3>

<p>Inspect your cooling towers regularly. Your local authority and the HSE will visit your premises to ensure you meet safety standards.</p>

<p>You should clean cooling towers:</p>

<ul>
<li>at least twice a year</li>
  <li>after any shutdown of more than a month</li>
  <li>after any major alterations</li>
</ul>
<p>Employ specialists to carry out cleaning. Cleaning will improve cooling tower efficiency and minimise the risk of disease.</p>

<p>You may store chemicals on your site, for example for maintenance. Chemicals you receive may be supplied with a safety data sheet (SDS). The SDS contains information about the chemical, including how to store, use and dispose of it safely. The SDS may also recommend the best methods and materials to use to clean up a spill. If you receive a chemical without an SDS, contact your supplier to find out whether or not they have to provide one.</p>

<p>Your paper and cardboard business may use company vehicles to transport materials and goods, or for staff business travel. You should check and control the emissions from your vehicles to minimise their impact on the environment.</p>

<p>Emissions from vehicle exhausts are a significant source of air pollution. Air pollutants in vehicle emissions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>carbon dioxide (CO2)</li>
  <li>carbon monoxide</li>
  <li>fine dust particles</li>
  <li>nitrogen oxides</li>
  <li>unburnt hydrocarbons</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit-vehicle-emissions">Limit vehicle emissions</h3>

<p>You should try to limit the vehicle emissions produced by your business as they may:</p>

<ul>
<li>lead to ill health, such as respiratory problems, in your staff and the public</li>
  <li>cause a nuisance to your neighbours</li>
  <li>contribute to roadside pollution levels in urban areas</li>

  <li>oil and fuel</li>
  <li>suspended solids</li>
  <li>grease</li>
  <li>antifreeze</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not allow run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater. This will cause pollution and you could be prosecuted.</p>

<p>You should only wash vehicles in defined areas where you can contain the wash water and any rainfall run-off.</p>

<p>If possible, direct the surface run-off from your vehicle washing area to an on-site treatment system. You could reduce your impact on the environment and save money by reusing the water.</p>

<p>You may be able to discharge surface run-off directly to a foul sewer or combined sewer. Ask your water and sewerage company if you need authorisation before you discharge run-off to a sewer. You must comply with any conditions of your authorisation.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-5">Good practice</h3>

<p>Use vehicle washing facilities and equipment that filter and reuse water, or set up a wash water recycling system.</p>

<p>Use trigger-operated spray guns. Make sure they have an automatic water supply cut-off.</p>

<p>Use settlement lagoons or suitable absorbent material such as flocculent to remove suspended solids, eg mud and silt. Before using flocculent, contact your water and sewerage company to make sure that you can still discharge to the sewer.</p>

<p>Use catchpots or silt traps on drains, and ensure that they are in place during cleaning. Empty them at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Remove oil, grease and fuel from wash water by passing it slowly through an appropriately sized oil separator.</p>

<p>Ensure that any discharge containing detergent cannot run to the oil separator, as this will stop it working.</p>

<p>If you use detergents, use a recycling system with no discharge or ensure that run-off containing detergents is collected in a sealed unit. Contact your local water and sewerage company about disposing of these materials to the foul sewer.</p>

<p>Minimise the amount of cleaning chemicals you use. Choose biodegradable and phosphate-free detergents as they are less harmful to the environment.</p>

<p>Carry out cleaning in a designated impermeable area that is isolated from the surrounding area, eg by a roll-over bund, raised kerb, ramps or stepped access.</p>

<p>Store all cleaning chemicals safely and in an area where you can contain spills. See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1086114143">chemical storage</a>.</p>

<p>Train all staff to follow vehicle cleaning procedures. Display details of procedures in the work area so staff can check them easily.</p>

<h2 id="pollution-incident-prevention-at-paper-and-cardboard-production-sites">Pollution incident prevention at paper and cardboard production sites</h2>

<p>Pollution incidents at your site can have serious environmental impacts. They may damage the water environment and biodiversity, cause air pollution and land contamination and harm human health. You can reduce the risk of pollution incidents with planning and preparation. Pollution incidents can be caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>fuel drips, spills or overfilling during refuelling or tank filling</li>
  <li>plant, pipes, equipment or containers leaking oil or chemicals</li>
  <li>pump and pipeline failures</li>
  <li>treatment plant failures</li>
  <li>contaminated water entering a watercourse or drain</li>
  <li>natural events, such as flooding, lightning strike and temperature extremes</li>
  <li>vandalism and theft</li>
  <li>deliberate acts, such as illegal disposal, dumping or fly-tipping</li>
  <li>wind blown dust and waste</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="produce-a-pollution-incident-response-plan">Produce a pollution incident response plan</h3>

<p>You should have a pollution incident response plan which outlines the actions you will take to reduce the chances that your business causes pollution from an incident or accident at your site.</p>

<p>Your plan should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>your site activities and operations</li>
  <li>what you store on your site</li>
  <li>emergency and out-of-hours contact details for key staff, regulators and emergency services</li>
  <li>a detailed site plan showing drainage layout, areas where the chances of causing pollution are high and areas vulnerable to pollution</li>
  <li>the actions to take in the event of an incident</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevent-and-remediate-environmental-damage">Prevent and remediate environmental damage</h3>

<p>A pollution incident may cause, or threaten to cause, environmental damage to water, land and biodiversity.</p>

<p>You must take action to prevent environmental damage and to remedy any damage you cause.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-pollution-from-firefighting">Prevent pollution from firefighting</h3>

<p>Firewater is water that has become contaminated by being used for firefighting. It is polluting and may be classified as hazardous waste. Ensure you have a plan and equipment in place to collect or contain it in the event of an emergency. You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>store firewater correctly</li>
  <li>ensure firewater is treated and disposed of correctly</li>
  <li>prevent firewater from running into surface drains, polluting nearby watercourses (rivers, streams and groundwater), foul drainage systems and land</li>

<h2 id="car-park-environmental-requirements-at-paper-and-cardboard-production-sites">Car park environmental requirements at paper and cardboard production sites</h2>

<p>Parking areas for operational employee or customer vehicles at your paper or cardboard production business may be a source of noise or pollution.</p>

<h3 id="reduce-noise-dust-and-nuisances-from-car-parks">Reduce noise, dust and nuisances from car parks</h3>

<p>If your business causes a nuisance to your neighbours, your local authority can require you to take steps to reduce or stop the nuisance, or impose restrictions on or stop your operations.</p>

<p>Nuisances from parking areas could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>noise and fumes from vehicle engines</li>
  <li>noise from vehicle alarms, eg reversing alarms</li>
  <li>dust from vehicle wheels</li>
  <li>excessive artificial lighting</li>
  <li>waste deposits</li>
  <li>vermin attracted by waste</li>
  <li>accumulated wind-blown rubbish</li>
</ul>
<p>You should control these potential sources of nuisance. See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1086041496">noise, odour and other nuisances</a>.</p>

<h3 id="check-your-permit-and-exemption-conditions">Check your permit and exemption conditions</h3>

<p>If you have an environmental permit or registered exemption, they may contain conditions that control emissions such as noise, dust or odour.</p>

<p>You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.</p>

<p>See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.s=tl&amp;topicId=1087477593">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production</a>.</p>

<h3 id="control-surface-water-run-off">Control surface water run-off</h3>

<p>Water that runs off the surface of your car parks can cause erosion, pollution and localised flooding. Run-off may contain pollutants such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>oil and fuel</li>
  <li>hydraulic fluids</li>
  <li>suspended solids</li>
  <li>grease</li>
  <li>antifreeze</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not allow contaminated run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater without permission. This will cause pollution and you could be prosecuted. See the page in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087482875&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;type=RESOURCES">water and sewer discharge responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a car park that has an area less than 800 square metres (fewer than 50 parking spaces), and you only use it for parking cars, you can discharge surface water run-off directly as long as you are not next to sensitive environments, eg Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).</p>

<p>If you have a larger car park, you should remove oil, grease, petrol and diesel from run-off by passing it through an oil separator before you discharge it. You should also use an oil separator for any run-off from areas used for more polluting activities, such as vehicle servicing.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may be able to use sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) to drain run-off from car parks. SUDS slow and hold back run-off from a site, so that pollutants can be broken down naturally.</p>

<p>See our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1085829333">using sustainable drainage systems to prevent pollution and flooding</a>.</p>

<p>If you clean vehicles on your car park, you must not allow run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater. If someone else cleans vehicles on your car park, it is your responsibility to ensure that they do not cause pollution. See the page in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087488896&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;type=RESOURCES">vehicle cleaning responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-6">Good practice</h3>

<p>Use catchpots or silt traps on drains, and ensure that they are working effectively. Empty them at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Encourage staff and visitors to use public transport or car share.</p>

<h2 id="land-contamination-responsibilities-at-paper-and-cardboard-production-sites">Land contamination responsibilities at paper and cardboard production sites</h2>

<p>If you operate a paper and cardboard production business, you could be causing land contamination from:</p>

<ul>
<li>spills or leaks of fuel, oil or chemicals from your storage areas</li>
  <li>pollutants seeping from leaking pipes or poorly maintained drainage systems</li>
  <li>inappropriate handling or disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals or fuel  </li>
</ul>
<p>The paper industry uses chemicals and materials that can cause contamination, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>metals and metallic compounds</li>
  <li>acids and alkalis</li>
  <li>inorganic elements and compounds</li>
  <li>solvents, oils and biocides  </li>
</ul>
<p>Many areas of land in the UK are contaminated by their past use. For example, land could be contaminated where chemicals have seeped into the land from previous industrial activities, or where previous owners have buried waste.</p>

<p>Cleaning up land affected by contamination is called remediation. Remediation ensures that the land no longer presents a risk to human health or the environment.</p>

<h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-land-contamination">Responsibilities for cleaning up land contamination</h3>

<p>You could be responsible for cleaning up land contamination, for example, if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>develop land that is contaminated</li>
  <li>cause environmental damage to land</li>
  <li>cause contamination in breach of your environmental permit</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be required to clean up land contamination before you are allowed to carry out development.</p>

<p>If you cause serious land contamination that affects the water environment, protected species or habitats, or human health, this can be classed as environmental damage. You could be responsible for land contamination if it is classed as environmental damage. See the page on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086988124&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;type=RESOURCES">environmental damage caused by land contamination</a> in our guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1080367423">dealing with land contamination</a>.  </p>

<p>You could also be responsible for land contamination if it is caused by you breaching the terms of your environmental permit. <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;topicId=1086287989">See our guide on environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply</a>.</p>

<h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-contaminated-land-under-part-2a">Responsibilities for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A</h3>

<p>Contaminated land is a legal term used to describe a specific type of land contamination that is regulated under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Part 2A deals with the UK’s legacy of contaminated land from past uses, such as former factories, mines, steelworks, refineries and landfills.</p>

<p>Your local authority is responsible for identifying contaminated land and making sure it is cleaned up. Land is classed as contaminated land under Part 2A when substances in, on or under it cause, or could cause, significant harm or pollution of surface waters and groundwater.</p>

<p>You could be responsible for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>cause or allow any land to be contaminated</li>
  <li>own or occupy the land, even if you did not cause the contamination</li>
</ul>
<p>Your local authority or the Environment Agency can serve you with a remediation notice. It will tell you what you must do to clean up the land and when you must carry out the work. A remediation notice can be served on more than one business. You can be prosecuted and may be fined if you do not comply with a remediation notice.</p>

<p>You can remediate contaminated land voluntarily and agree a remediation scheme with your local authority or the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>Ask a consultant to carry out a desktop survey and possibly some site investigations to check if land could be contaminated before you purchase it.</p>

<p>Research the history of your site and the activities carried out on it. Investigate any land that could be contaminated and see if you can identify who may have caused any contamination.</p>

<p>Store oil and chemicals safely to avoid causing pollution.</p>

<p>Keep absorbent materials and other containment equipment close to where you might need them. Ensure that they are suitable for the type and quantity of fuel, oil and chemicals you store and use on site. Ensure that your staff know where they are and how to use them properly.</p>
