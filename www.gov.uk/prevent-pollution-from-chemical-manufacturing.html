<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Chemical manufacturing businesses can have harmful impacts on the environment, for example by causing pollution. The chemical industry includes producers of commodity chemicals such as organic and inorganic chemicals and industrial gases, and speciality chemicals such as pharmaceutical products and essential oils. It also includes mixing, blending, diluting or converting basic chemicals to make chemical products and preparations, eg paints, pesticides, inks, detergents and cosmetics.</p>

<p>Your activities may cause air pollution from the release of chemical fumes and odours, noise pollution from processing plant and machinery, water pollution from contaminated discharges or accidental spills, or land contamination from storing chemicals or oil. If you cause a pollution incident you may be prosecuted or fined and have to pay clean-up costs, all of which could damage your reputation.</p>

<p>This guide describes your responsibilities for preventing pollution to air, land and water. It includes guidance on controlling noise and vibration, vehicle emissions and pollutants from vehicle cleaning and car parks, and using refrigeration equipment. It also covers how to prevent and deal with pollution incidents.</p>

<h2 id="air-pollution-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Air pollution responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Air emissions from chemical manufacturing can contain a wide range of harmful substances which can have negative effects on the environment and human health.</p>

<p>Emissions to air or odours can result from:</p>

<ul>
<li>reaction or distillation facilities</li>
  <li>combustion plant</li>
  <li>products used in specific chemical processes, eg chlorophenols</li>
  <li>storing raw materials such as solvents, eg ethyl acetate, toluene and xylene</li>
  <li>using certain chemical groups, eg volatile organic compounds (<abbr title="volatile organic compounds">VOCs</abbr>) or sulfurous compounds</li>
  <li>waste and wastewater treatment processes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comply-with-your-permit-conditions">Comply with your permit conditions</h3>

<p>If you have an environmental permit, you must meet the conditions it contains.</p>

<p>Your permit may contain conditions relating to odour and emissions to air, including controls on substances such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>halogens - substances that contain chlorine, fluorine, iodine and bromine</li>
  <li>nitrous oxides</li>
  <li>ozone-depleting substances (<abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr>) - eg carbon tetrachloride, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (<abbr title="hydrochlorofluorocarbons">HCFCs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>suspended particulates - eg dust</li>
  <li>sulphur dioxide</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="volatile organic compounds">VOCs</abbr> - eg acetaldehyde, ethylene, phenol</li>
</ul>
<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-chemical-manufacturing">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for chemical manufacturing</a>.</p>

<p>If you use organic solvents, you must comply with further requirements. These will reduce or control your solvent emissions. See the  the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">hazardous substance responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-odour-and-nuisance">Prevent odour and nuisance</h3>

<p>You must make sure your activities don’t cause a nuisance to your neighbours or the local community. Nuisances could include smoke, dust and odour. Anyone affected by a nuisance can take legal action against you or your business, or complain to your local authority.</p>

<p>If your business causes a nuisance, or could cause or repeat a nuisance, you can be issued with an abatement notice, which can:</p>

<ul>
<li>stop or restrict your operations</li>
  <li>require you to take steps to restrict or remove the nuisance</li>
</ul>
<p>You can be fined if you do not comply with an abatement notice.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1086041496">noise, odour and other nuisances</a>.</p>

<h3 id="meet-ods-or-fluorinated-gas-f-gas-requirements">Meet <abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr> or fluorinated gas (<abbr title="fluorinated gas">F-gas</abbr>) requirements</h3>

<p>If your business supplies or handles <abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr> or F-gases, or uses equipment that contains them, you must comply with a number of legal obligations. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">hazardous substance responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-emitting-dark-smoke">Avoid emitting dark smoke</h3>

<p>You must not cause or allow a chimney or bonfire on your site to emit dark smoke. You can apply for an exemption from this requirement when burning certain waste materials in the open, eg waste explosives. You must still comply with any other legislation that covers these activities. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1080460523">preventing air pollution</a>.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>Take simple steps to reduce dust, odours and fumes to help you avoid causing air pollution.</p>

<p>Store loose materials either indoors or under cover. Store oil and chemicals in suitable, sealed containers and make sure that lids fit tightly.</p>

<p>Make sure the seals in your equipment fit properly and are in good condition, eg around valves and flanges.</p>

<p>Establish systems to monitor, measure, control and minimise solvent emissions.</p>

<p>Install chemical recovery systems to capture chemicals in exhaust gases.</p>

<p>Use extraction units to remove dust and odour from your operations and filter the extracted air before you release it into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Regularly inspect and maintain all abatement equipment, such as scrubbers, carbon filters and dust filters, to ensure your equipment runs efficiently. Make regular visual inspections of your emissions to air and keep inspection records on your site.</p>

<p>Ensure that roads and any open storage areas are hard-surfaced. Clean these regularly to reduce dust.</p>

<p>Cover skips and lorries leaving your site.</p>

<h2 id="noise-pollution-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Noise pollution responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Chemical manufacturing businesses may create noise in many ways, for example by:</p>

<ul>
<li>operating large processing plant and machinery, eg compressors and vacuum pumps</li>
  <li>moving raw materials and goods to and from site</li>
  <li>using vehicles on site, especially if they have reversing alarms</li>
</ul>
<p>Your activities can also create vibration.</p>

<p>If noise or vibration from your activities causes a nuisance to the surrounding community, your local authority can limit your operations or even stop you from working. They can restrict:</p>

<ul>
<li>the machinery you use</li>
  <li>your working hours</li>
  <li>noise levels from your premises</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a permit or exemption and you breach noise conditions, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you. If you do not address a noise problem you could face legal action and a fine.</p>

<p>You must comply with any noise conditions set out in the planning approval for your site.</p>

<h3 id="register-your-burglar-alarms">Register your burglar alarms</h3>

<p>If your business is located in an alarm notification area you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>register your burglar alarm with your local authority</li>
  <li>provide the details of a person who holds the keys</li>
  <li>ensure the key holder knows how to use the alarm system</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be fined if you do not register. Contact your local authority to find out if your business is in an alarm notification area.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1074537118">Find contact details for your local authority through our Contacts Directory</a>.</p>

<h3 id="protect-your-employees-from-loud-noise">Protect your employees from loud noise</h3>

<p>Loud noise can cause irreversible hearing damage. You must protect your employees’ hearing.</p>

<h3 id="check-your-permit-conditions">Check your permit conditions</h3>

<p>If you have an environmental permit or a waste exemption, it may contain conditions that control emissions, such as noise. You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-chemical-manufacturing">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for chemical manufacturing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-1">Good practice</h3>

<p>Carry out noisy activities away from areas where noise may cause a nuisance. Position noisy equipment away from your site boundary. You can use existing buildings to shield the noise source.</p>

<p>Make sure your buildings have adequate soundproofing. Shutting your doors and windows will also reduce noise. Use solid panelled fencing around your site instead of wire fences. This can help to screen the source and reduce the level of noise from your site.</p>

<p>Reduce noise from your equipment and vehicles by servicing them regularly. Consider fitting noise-reducing devices, and when you replace equipment consider buying quieter alternatives.</p>

<p>You should regularly monitor noise from your site, when it is fully working and also when it is shut down. This will give you an idea of the impact of your work on noise levels in the surrounding community. Monitoring will also help you identify any change in noise levels. If you are in any doubt about noise levels, you should get advice from a noise expert.</p>

<p>Limit noisy activities to daylight hours as noise is more likely to be a nuisance at night.</p>

<p>If you operate a night shift, move materials into the work area during the day or early evening. This will reduce the risk of complaints from the local community.</p>

<p>If you receive a complaint make sure you deal with it properly. Read about how to deal with complaints in the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1086041496">noise, odour and other nuisances</a>.</p>

<h2 id="water-and-sewer-discharge-responsibilities-for-chemical-manufacturers">Water and sewer discharge responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>If you pollute water, or cause or risk causing environmental damage to water, you are committing an offence.</p>

<p>Your chemical manufacturing business can pollute watercourses and sewers by discharging raw materials and effluent. You may produce contaminated wastewater from:</p>

<ul>
<li>boiler operations</li>
  <li>chemical reaction cooling processes</li>
  <li>discharge from wet scrubbers</li>
  <li>cleaning operations</li>
  <li>effluent or other treatment plants</li>
  <li>site drainage and stormwater run-off</li>
</ul>
<p>These sources may contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>heavy metals, eg cadmium and mercury</li>
  <li>hydrocarbons, eg benzene</li>
  <li>resins</li>
  <li>solvents, eg dichloroethane</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="get-permission-to-discharge-to-water-and-sewers">Get permission to discharge to water and sewers</h3>

<p>You must get an environmental permit or register an exemption from environmental permitting from the Environment Agency before you discharge anything other than uncontaminated water to surface waters or groundwater. You may also need consent if you need to construct a new outfall structure for your discharge.</p>

<p>You must comply with the conditions of your permit or exemption or you may be prosecuted and fined.</p>

<p>You must have permission from your water and sewerage company before you discharge anything other than clean, uncontaminated water to their drainage system. If you discharge trade effluent to a public foul sewer, you must first have a trade effluent consent or agreement.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-chemical-manufacturing">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for chemical manufacturing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-environmental-damage">Prevent environmental damage</h3>

<p>Water pollution can be classed as environmental damage in some circumstances.</p>

<p>You must prevent and clean up environmental damage that occurs from surface or groundwater pollution caused by your business activities. If anyone else reports environmental damage as a result of your activities, your enforcing authority will have to investigate.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1086885096">pollution incidents and environmental damage - an overview</a>.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-2">Good practice</h3>

<p>Store hazardous materials, fuel, oil and chemicals safely and in an area where you can contain spills. This may be a legal requirement if you store oil. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1080454826">storing oil</a>.</p>

<p>You should use an impermeable secondary containment system such as a:</p>

<ul>
<li>bunded area</li>
  <li>bunded pallet or spill pallet</li>
  <li>sump pallet</li>
  <li>bunded storage unit</li>
  <li>bunded drum store</li>
  <li>storage cabinet with an integral sump</li>
</ul>
<p>Your bund and any bunded pallets should be able to contain at least 110 per cent of the volume of the largest tank or 25 per cent of the total volume you are likely to store, whichever is greater. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1086114143">chemical storage</a>.</p>

<p>Follow the pollution prevention guidelines (<abbr title="pollution prevention guidelines">PPGs</abbr>) to avoid causing pollution. This is particularly important if your business is in an area that has vulnerable groundwater. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/39083.aspx">Find <abbr title="pollution prevention guidelines">PPGs</abbr> on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>Prepare a pollution incident response procedure for dealing with spills. Make sure that your staff are familiar with the procedure and know how to implement it.</p>

<p>See the page in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087560282&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;type=RESOURCES">pollution incident prevention at chemical manufacturing sites</a>.</p>

<h2 id="land-contamination-responsibilities-at-chemical-manufacturing-sites">Land contamination responsibilities at chemical manufacturing sites</h2>

<p>If you operate a chemical manufacturing business, you could be causing land contamination from:</p>

<ul>
<li>spills of fuel, oil or chemicals from your storage areas</li>
  <li>pollutants seeping from leaking pipes or poorly maintained drainage systems</li>
  <li>inappropriate handling or disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals or fuel</li>
</ul>
<p>Many areas of land in the UK are contaminated by their past use. For example, land could be contaminated where chemicals have seeped into the land from previous industrial activities, or where previous owners have buried waste.</p>

<p>Your current activities could also cause land contamination, particularly if you handle hazardous substances such as chemicals or fuel.</p>

<p>Cleaning up land affected by contamination is called remediation. Remediation ensures that the land no longer presents a risk to human health or the environment.</p>

<h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-land-contamination">Responsibilities for cleaning up land contamination</h3>

<p>You could be responsible for cleaning up land contamination, for example, if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>develop land that is contaminated</li>
  <li>cause environmental damage to land</li>
  <li>cause contamination in breach of your environmental permit</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be required to clean up land contamination before you are allowed to carry out development.</p>

<p>If you cause serious land contamination that affects the water environment, protected species or habitats, or human health, this can be classed as environmental damage. You could be responsible for land contamination if it is classed as environmental damage. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1080367423">dealing with land contamination</a>.</p>

<p>You could also be responsible for land contamination if it is caused by you breaching the terms of your environmental permit. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1086287989">environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply</a>.</p>

<h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-contaminated-land-under-part-2a">Responsibilities for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A</h3>

<p>Contaminated land is a legal term used to describe a specific type of land contamination that is regulated under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Part 2A deals with the UK’s legacy of contaminated land from past uses, such as former factories, mines, steelworks, refineries and landfills.</p>

<p>Your local authority is responsible for identifying contaminated land and making sure it is cleaned up. Land is classed as contaminated land under Part 2A when substances in, on or under it cause, or could cause, significant harm or pollution of surface waters and groundwater.</p>

<p>You could be responsible for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>cause or allow any land to be contaminated</li>
  <li>own or occupy the land, even if you did not cause the contamination</li>
</ul>
<p>Your local authority or the Environment Agency can serve you with a remediation notice. It will tell you what you must do to clean up the land and when you must carry out the work. A remediation notice can be served on more than one business. You can be prosecuted and may be fined if you do not comply with a remediation notice.</p>

<p>You can remediate contaminated land voluntarily and agree a remediation scheme with your local authority or the Environment Agency. </p>

<h3 id="good-practice-3">Good practice</h3>

<p>Ask a consultant to carry out a desktop survey and possibly some site investigations to check if land could be contaminated before you purchase it.</p>

<p>Research the history of your site and the activities carried out on it. Investigate any land that could be contaminated and see if you can identify who may have caused any contamination.</p>

<p>Store oil and chemicals safely to avoid causing pollution.</p>

<p>Keep absorbent materials and other containment equipment close to where you might need them. Ensure that they are suitable for the type and quantity of fuel, oil and chemicals you store and use on site. Ensure that your staff know where they are and how to use them properly.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;topicId=1086114143">chemical storage</a>.</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-emission-obligations-for-chemical-manufacturers">Vehicle emission obligations for chemical manufacturers</h2>

<p>Your chemical manufacturing business may use company vehicles to transport chemicals and chemical products, or for sales reps and other staff to get to meetings. You should check and control the emissions from your vehicles to minimise their impact on the environment.</p>

<p>Emissions from vehicle exhausts are a significant source of air pollution. Air pollutants in vehicle emissions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>carbon dioxide (CO2)</li>
  <li>carbon monoxide</li>
  <li>fine dust particles</li>
  <li>nitrogen oxides</li>
  <li>unburnt hydrocarbons</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit-vehicle-emissions">Limit vehicle emissions</h3>

<p>You should try to limit the vehicle emissions produced by your business as they may:</p>

<ul>
<li>lead to ill health, such as respiratory problems, in your staff and the public</li>
  <li>cause a nuisance to your neighbours</li>
  <li>contribute to roadside pollution levels in urban areas</li>
  <li>contribute to climate change</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meet-vehicle-emission-requirements">Meet vehicle emission requirements</h3>

<p>Make sure that your vehicles comply with emission limits and weight regulations. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) carries out roadside checks to enforce these standards.</p>

<h3 id="check-your-permit-and-exemption-conditions">Check your permit and exemption conditions</h3>

<p>If you have an environmental permit or registered exemption, they may contain conditions that control emissions such as noise, dust or odour.</p>

<p>You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-chemical-manufacturing">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for chemical manufacturing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="control-surface-water-run-off">Control surface water run-off</h3>

<p>Water that runs off the surface of your car parks can cause erosion, pollution and localised flooding. Run-off may contain pollutants such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>oil and fuel</li>
  <li>hydraulic fluids</li>
  <li>suspended solids</li>
  <li>grease</li>
  <li>antifreeze</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not allow contaminated run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater without permission. This will cause pollution and you could be prosecuted. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087535197&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900032&amp;r.l3=1087508547&amp;type=RESOURCES">water and sewer discharge responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a car park that has an area less than 800 square metres (fewer than 50 parking spaces), and you only use it for parking cars, you can discharge surface water run-off directly as long as you are not next to sensitive environments, eg Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).</p>

<p>If you have a larger car park, you should remove oil, grease, petrol and diesel from run-off by passing it through an oil separator before you discharge it. You should also use an oil separator for any run-off from areas used for more polluting activities, such as vehicle servicing.</p>

<p>Firewater is water that has become contaminated by being used for firefighting. It is polluting and may be classified as hazardous waste. Ensure you have a plan and equipment in place to collect or contain it in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>store firewater correctly</li>
  <li>ensure firewater is treated and disposed of correctly</li>
  <li>prevent firewater from running into surface drains, polluting nearby watercourses (rivers, streams and groundwater), foul drainage systems and land</li>
</ul>
