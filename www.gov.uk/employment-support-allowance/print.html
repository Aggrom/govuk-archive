  </header><h2>Moving from Incapacity Benefits to Employment Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</h2>

<p>You’ll be told whether you’re in the Support Group or Work-Related Activity Group after the review of your claim to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support paid becaused of illness or disability</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance</li>

<p>If the amount of incapacity benefit you get is more than the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you’ll get a ‘top-up payment’. This means that you’ll continue to get the same amount of money as you get now. The amount of benefit you get won’t rise until the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> catches up with the amount of the top-up payment.   </p>

<p>If the amount of incapacity benefit you get is lower than the amount of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you will get more money. Your money will increase as soon as you move to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>.</p>
