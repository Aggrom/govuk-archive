<p>If you can’t resolve a dispute, workers in a recognised trade union may consider taking industrial action. </p>

<p>A trade union can only call for industrial action if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the dispute can’t be solved by informal negotiations or arbitration</li>
  <li>a majority the members involved support it through a postal ballot (before organising one, the union has to decide which members it wants to ask to take industrial action)</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of industrial action might include a strike, or action short of a strike (eg not working overtime).</p>

<p>If workers go on strike, you don’t have to <a href="/if-your-business-faces-industrial-action/strike-pay-and-working-records" title="pay and working records">pay</a> them for the hours lost.</p>

<h2>Using agency workers to cover during a strike</h2>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Agencies aren’t allowed to supply workers specifically to cover work that isn’t being done during <a href="/if-your-business-faces-industrial-action/lawful-industrial-action" title="lawful industrial action">lawful industrial action</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Agency workers already in place as part of your normal business can carry on as usual. </p>

<h2>Dismissing workers who take industrial action</h2>

<p>As an employer, you may face unfair dismissal claims if you dismiss:</p>

<ul>
<li>employees within the first 12 weeks of lawful industrial action for taking part </li>
  <li>some workers for taking part in the action, but not others </li>
  <li>all employees but re-hire only some of them </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Some employees might have <a href="/dismiss-staff/unfair-dismissals" title="Dismissing staff: unfair dismissals">protection from unfair dismissal</a> for more than 12 weeks.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="lawful-industrial-action"><header><h1>Part 2: Lawful industrial action</h1>
  </header><p>Trade unions only have statutory immunity (ie they and their members are protected from legal action in civil law) if the industrial action is lawful. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no legal immunity in criminal law for strikers or organisers who break the law (eg by intentionally damaging property or trespassing).</p>
</div>

<h2>When industrial action is lawful</h2>

<p>There must be: </p>

<ul>
<li>a trade dispute (ie a dispute between you and your workers about employment-related issues)</li>
  <li>a properly-conducted industrial action ballot </li>
  <li>a written notice of industrial action sent to you</li>
</ul>
<p>The industrial action must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>be secondary action (ie taken by workers whose employer is not involved in the trade dispute)</li>
  <li>be in support of an employee dismissed for taking unofficial industrial action</li>
  <li>promote closed-shop practices (ie when employers agree to employ only union members) or enforce trade union membership against non-union firms</li>
  <li>involve unlawful picketing</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>When civil proceedings can take place</h2>

<p>If the union or individuals don’t follow these conditions, they don’t have statutory immunity. This means that you and anyone else affected by the industrial action can take civil proceedings in the courts as long as all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>an unlawful, unprotected act has happened or been threatened </li>
  <li>the action breaks a contract that you’re a party to </li>
  <li>you’ve suffered, or are likely to suffer, loss as a result</li>
</ul></article><article id="strike-pay-and-working-records"><header><h1>Part 3: Strike pay and working records</h1>
  </header><p>You can ask your employees if they are planning to strike, so that you can tell what effect the strike will have, but they do not have to tell you their plans.</p>

<h2>Deducting pay</h2>

<p>You don’t have to pay employees who are on strike. </p>

<p>If workers take action short of a strike, and refuse to carry out part of their contractual work, this is called ‘partial performance’. If you refuse to accept partial performance, you must tell employees that:</p>

<ul>
<li>they should only attend work if they fulfil their contractual duties</li>
  <li>if they don’t fulfil the terms of their employment contract, you don’t have to pay them</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do accept partial performance, you must still pay employees for any work that they have done.  </p>

<h2>How much pay to deduct during a strike</h2>

<p>You should only deduct the amount that the employee would have earned during the strike. How you work this out may depend on how they are paid (eg hourly, weekly or monthly) and on the terms of their employment contract.</p>

<p>You can’t deduct an employee’s pay if they weren’t supposed to be working on the day of the strike.</p>

<h2>Effect on continuous employment and length of service</h2>

<p>If employees return to work after the strike, their continuous employment is not affected (ie they continue to be employed by you). This means that the terms and conditions of their employment contracts still apply during and after the strike. </p>

<p>However, days when they were on strike don’t count towards their total length of service - this may be important for working out things like statutory redundancy pay or pensions.</p>

</article><article id="picketing-during-strikes"><header><h1>Part 4: Picketing during strikes</h1>
  </header><p>During the strike, workers and union reps may stand outside the place of work to explain why they’re striking and try to persuade others to join the strike. This is called picketing. It’s only lawful if it’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>carried out near or at the strikers’ usual place of work (unless they are mobile workers)</li>
  <li>done peacefully, without abusive or threatening behaviour </li>
  <li>not breaking any criminal laws (eg damaging property or obstructing roads)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be able to take legal action if picketing is unlawful.</p>

</div>


</article><article id="nonunion-employees-and-strikes"><header><h1>Part 5: Non-union employees and strikes</h1>
  </header><p>You can ask non-union employees to cover work during a strike, as long as:</p>

<ul>
<li>this is allowed by their employment contracts </li>
  <li>you don’t <a href="/employer-preventing-discrimination/what-discrimination-is" title="preventing discrimination">discriminate</a> against any employee directly or indirectly</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-union staff and striking</h2>

<p>If non-union members go on strike, they are protected from dismissal and have the same rights as union members, as long as the industrial action is <a href="lawful-industrial-action" title="lawful industrial action">lawful</a>.</p>

<h2>Agency staff</h2>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t hire agency staff to provide temporary work cover during a strike.</p>
</div>

<p>Agency staff who are already in place as part of normal business can carry on as usual. </p>
