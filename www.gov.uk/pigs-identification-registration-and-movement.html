<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Managing and controlling disease is essential for all livestock farmers. To control pig diseases, pigs must be marked and their movements pre-notified so they can be readily identified and traced in the event of disease outbreak. Daily inspections, surveillance, and good record keeping also play their part alongside mandatory identification and notification rules.</p>

<p>This guide explains the critical role that unique herd marks play, and gives you advice on how to obtain them. It shows you how to comply with regulations and find further sources of information.</p>

<h2 id="pigkeeping-and-cross-compliance">Pigkeeping and cross compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme and other direct payments - eg the Environmental Stewardship schemes - you must meet all relevant cross compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAECs)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smr-6---pig-identification-and-registration">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 6 - Pig identification and registration</h3>

<p>The aim of <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 6 is to reduce the risk of pig diseases spreading, through controlling movements and improving traceability. They apply to you if you keep any number of pigs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 6 specifies what you must do about registration and identification and keeping on-farm records. </p>

<p>You must not remove or replace a pig’s identification without permission unless it is lost, illegible or removed for welfare reasons. You must apply the required replacement identification.</p>

<p>Download <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 6 - pig identification and registration from the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/428d0e320d1ee4ee802573aa0054f2d0!OpenDocument">Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website (PDF, 915K).</a></p>

<h2 id="registration-and-on-farm-records-for-pigs">Registration and on-farm records for pigs</h2>

<p>Whether you keep one pig as a pet or a commercial herd, you need to be registered with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>). To register, you should contact the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>). They will ask for your nine-digit Country Parish Holding (<abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr>) number. </p>

<p>You will then be able to register your livestock over the phone. If your correspondence address is different from the herd/flock location, you should inform the <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> and confirm they have the correct details. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool</a> on the <abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</p>
</div>

<p>When your pigs are registered, a herd mark will be automatically created for them. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> will send you a registration document containing your personal details, <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> and flock/herd mark. If any of your details change, you must tell your <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> within one month of the change.</p>

<p>In addition to registration with <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>, you will also have to apply to the Environment Agency for an environmental permit if your livestock capacity exceeds:</p>

<ul>
<li>750 sows</li>
  <li>2,000 production pigs over 30 kilograms</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the detail on how to apply for an intensive pig farming permit on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/40069.aspx">Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<p>You must keep all records relating to pigkeeping - including registration, identification and movement - for a period of three years.</p>

<h2 id="identification-of-pigs">Identification of pigs</h2>

<p>Pig identification and traceability are central to disease control. This is why all of your pigs must be marked with your unique herd mark.</p>

<p>Before you move the animals to your land, you must apply to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> for your nine-digit <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number for the land on which you will keep the pigs. You can do this by calling the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 603 7777. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will then call you with your <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number.</p>

<p>Once you have a <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number for your land, you can move the pigs onto it. You must then register them with your nearest <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. As soon as you register a pig - whether a single animal or a commercial herd - you will automatically get your unique herd mark. The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> will send you a registration document containing your personal details, <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> and herd mark. The herd mark will be one or two letters followed by a four-digit number, eg A1234 or AB1234. The herd mark is a quick and effective way of identifying the premises that pigs have moved from. It is available to inspectors for rapid tracing.</p>

<p>You must pre-notify all movement of pigs from your holding. </p>

<p>Before they are moved off your holding, pigs must also have the herd mark applied by one of the following means:</p>

<ul>
<li>slapmark - a permanent ink mark of your herd mark, applied to each front shoulder area of the pig</li>
  <li>eartag - stamped or printed, not handwritten, containing the letters ‘UK’ followed by your herd mark</li>
  <li>tattoo - of your herd mark on the ear of the pig, including the use of compressed air to drive tattooing pins into the skin of pigs provided the tattoo is easy to read</li>
  <li>temporary paint mark, eg a red line, black cross or blue circle, which must last until the pig reaches its destination</li>
</ul>
<p>All pigs going to slaughter must be identified with their herd mark. All pigs over one year old moving to another holding, a collection centre, a market or for breeding must also be identified with a herd mark. Pigs under one year old must have a temporary paint mark if they are moving to another holding, but permanent marking is needed for other movements.</p>

<p>Note that if you import pigs from outside the European Union, you no longer have to apply a new identification mark if you are moving the animal directly to a slaughterhouse for slaughter within 30 days of arrival.</p>

<p>You can find an archived list of slapmark equipment manufacturers on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/pigs/slapmark_makers.htm"><abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You can also read more about the identification of pigs in <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/disease-prevention-for-livestock-farmers">disease prevention</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/pig-welfare-regulations">pig welfare</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pre-notification-of-pigs-before-movement-from-a-holding">Pre-notification of pigs before movement from a holding</h2>

<p>You must pre-notify all movements of pigs from their holdings before you move them. You will be able to do so in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Electronically - by entering prescribed information into the eAML2 electronic pig movement service from BPEX. You will then have to print off a summary movement document to give to your haulier. Use the BPEX online pig movement <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bpex-online-pig-movement">licence tool</a>. E-notification is also possible via the BPEX website.</li>
  <li>By telephone, fax or post - using paper form AML 2 to Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited (<abbr title="Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited">MLCSL</abbr>), BPEX or the British Pig Association. Note that you will not be permitted to move these pigs until you have received a document from <abbr title="Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited">MLCSL</abbr> recording keeper and stock information, with copies for sender, transporter and receiver of the animals.</li>
</ul>
<p>BPEX is the division of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board with responsibility for the pig industry in England.</p>

<p>Note that by using eAML2, you will be able to combine AML2 and Food Chain Information (<abbr title="Food Chain Information">FCI</abbr>) for farm-to-slaughter moves.</p>

<p>At the holding destination, the receiving keeper must use one of the above methods within three days of receipt to notify arrival of the pigs. Where paper forms are used, the keeper must retain a copy for at least six months.</p>

<p>On 1 April 2012, use of the BPEX eAML2 will become mandatory. Until then, when you send pigs to another holding, you can notify their movement by completing and signing a paper AML 2. The keeper taking receipt of the pigs must send it to <abbr title="Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited">MLCSL</abbr> within three days of receiving the transported animals.</p>

<p>If you choose to continue using the paper AML 2 during the transition period, you must not send it to your local authority, but to the <abbr title="Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited">MLCSL</abbr>:</p>

<p><abbr title="Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited">MLCSL</abbr><br>
Stoneleigh Park<br>
Kenilworth<br>
Warwickshire<br>
CV8 2TL</p>

<p>When you move pigs to a market or collection centre, you will not need to notify the movement in advance if the market or collection centre agrees to notify BPEX electronically on the day of the pigs’ arrival.</p>

<p>Additional identification will be required when you move pigs for showing or breeding purposes. This means that a pig must be marked with its herdmark, the letters “UK” and a unique individual identification number before you move it for any of these purposes off a holding:</p>

<ul>
<li>to a show or exhibition</li>
  <li>for breeding purposes with the intention of returning the pig to the holding from which it was moved</li>
  <li>for the purpose of collection of semen at a porcine semen centre</li>
</ul>
<p>If you move pigs intended for export from Great Britain from a holding to a port, the keeper at that holding must send a copy of the document to <abbr title="Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited">MLCSL</abbr> within three days of the animal leaving the holding.</p>

<h2 id="pig-welfare-in-transport">Pig welfare in transport</h2>

<p>When moving animals, you must transport them in a way that won’t cause them injury or unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>While European Union rules apply to all live, vertebrate animals transported for economic reasons, more stringent elements apply to the transport of farm livestock, such as pigs.</p>

<p>When transporting livestock, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>plan journeys thoroughly and keep their duration to a minimum</li>
  <li>ensure the animals are fit to travel and check them regularly</li>
  <li>ensure vehicle loading and unloading facilities are constructed and maintained to avoid injury and suffering</li>
  <li>ensure those handling animals are competent and don’t use violence or any methods likely to cause fear, injury or suffering</li>
  <li>provide sufficient floor space and height allowance</li>
  <li>provide water, feed and rest as required</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/farm-animal-welfare-during-transportation">farmed animal welfare during transportation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fitness-for-travel">Fitness for travel</h3>

<p>It’s illegal to transport an animal that’s considered unfit for travel. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>new-born mammals where the navel has not completely healed</li>
  <li>heavily pregnant females - where more than 90 per cent of the expected gestation period has passed</li>
  <li>females who have given birth during the previous seven days</li>
  <li>sick or injured animals where moving them would cause additional suffering - unless instructed by a vet</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="livestock-welfare-and-restrictions-at-market-and-shows">Livestock welfare and restrictions at market and shows</h3>

<p>Special requirements apply when transporting livestock to market, their welfare while at market and during movement between holdings, markets and/or slaughterhouses. For more information, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/farmed-animal-welfare-at-shows-and-markets">farmed animal welfare at shows and markets</a>.</p>

<p>Before moving pigs to your holding, you need to apply to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> for a <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number for the land where you will keep the pigs. Before moving pigs off a holding, you must pre-notify that movement. </p>

<h3 id="standstill">Standstill</h3>

<p>Once you move pigs onto your holding, you cannot move any other pigs off it for 20 days. You must also wait six days before you can remove any cattle, sheep or goats from the holding. There are exceptions to this rule for animals going to slaughter or slaughter market, market, collecting centre, show or breed inspection. If you move cattle, sheep or goats onto the holding, then you cannot move the pigs off it for six days.</p>

<p>This ‘standstill’ acts as an incubation period and slows down the potential spread of disease. There are some exemptions and exceptions, eg pig breeding pyramids or commercial pig pyramids. To apply to become an approved herd within a pig breeding pyramid, you should contact your local divisional veterinary manager.</p>

<p>Whenever you move pigs, you must follow the conditions of the General Licence for the Movement of Pigs.</p>

<p>To help you comply with the conditions, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>find and download AML2 and AML2A - report of a pig movement under the general licence on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/2011/03/30/aml2-pig-move-licence/"><abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>
</li>
  <li>download Annexes A-C  - movement standstill and exemptions for pigs and other livestock from the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/pigs/documents/annexa-c-090713.pdf"><abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 54K)</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exemptions---including-moves-to-markets-collecting-centres-shows-breed-inspections">Exemptions - including moves to markets, collecting centres, shows, breed inspections</h3>

<p>There are several specific exemptions to the movement standstill rule. For example, the movement of an animal onto premises licensed under the Animal Gatherings (England) Order 2010 for a sale, show or exhibition, for onward consignment within Great Britain for further rearing, finishing or slaughter or for an inspection to confirm specific breed characteristics will not trigger a standstill on that premises.</p>

<h3 id="electronic-pre-notification-is-replacing-the-paper-aml-2-movement-document">Electronic pre-notification is replacing the paper AML 2 movement document</h3>

<p>You can pre-notify pig movements electronically - ie under eAML2  instead of using the paper AML 2 paper document. As of 1 April 2012, electronic notification will be mandatory and you will no longer be permitted to use paper forms for pig movements.</p>

<p>Use the online pig movement licence tool from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bpex-online-pig-movement">BPEX.</a></p>

<p>You will need an AML 2 movement document to report movements of pigs under the General Licence, and you must keep the document for three years after the move. You must record movements within 36 hours and retain the records for three years.</p>

<p>You will need an AML 2 movement document to report movements of pigs under the General Licence, and you must keep the document for six months after the move. You must record movements within 36 hours and retain the records for six months.</p>

<p>You need to complete four copies of an AML 2 movement document when you move sheep and goats off the same premises in which you keep pigs. The recipient of the animals must send the white copy of the completed AML 2 form to their local authority within three days of the move. </p>

<p>The other copies are for the animals’ recipient, the haulier and you as the departure farmer. You can find and download AML 2 and AML2A documents on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/2011/03/30/aml2-pig-move-licence/"><abbr title="Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>
