  </header><p>A Lasting Power of Attorney lets you appoint someone to make decisions on your behalf.</p>

<ul>
<li>health and welfare</li>
  <li>property and financial affairs</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to make one type of Lasting Power of Attorney or both.</p>

<h2>Health and welfare Lasting Power of Attorney</h2>

<p>This allows you to choose one person or more to make decisions about things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>your daily routine (eg eating and what to wear)</li>
  <li>medical care</li>
  <li>moving into a care home </li>
  <li>refusing life-sustaining treatment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Property and financial affairs Lasting Power of Attorney</h2>

<p>This lets you choose one person or more to make decisions about money and property for you, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>paying bills</li>
  <li>collecting benefits </li>
  <li>selling your home</li>
</ul>
<p>You can appoint someone to look after your property and financial affairs at any time.</p>

</article><article id="choosing-your-attorney"><header><h1>Part 2: Choose your attorney</h1>
  </header><p>You can choose one person or more to make decisions on your behalf, as your ‘attorney’.</p>

<p>When choosing an attorney, think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>how well the person looks after their own affairs, eg their finances</li>
  <li>how well you know them</li>
  <li>if you trust them to make decisions in your best interests</li>
  <li>how happy they will be to make decisions for you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who can be your attorney</h2>

<p>Your attorney can be anyone 18 or over, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>a relative</li>
  <li>a friend</li>
  <li>a professional (like a solicitor)</li>
  <li>your husband, wife or partner</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who can’t be your attorney</h2>

<p>You can’t choose someone who:</p>

<ul>
<li>is under 18</li>
  <li>is unable to make decisions</li>
  <li>has been declared bankrupt (if you want them to look after property or money)</li>

<h2>Other ways a Lasting Power of Attorney can end</h2>

<p>A Lasting Power of Attorney will end automatically if the attorney:</p>

<ul>
<li>dies</li>
  <li>loses the ability to make decisions - ‘mental capacity’</li>
  <li>divorces or ends a civil partnership with the donor</li>
</ul>
<p>It can continue if:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are other attorneys</li>
  <li>they can make individual decisions on behalf of the donor</li>
</ul>
<p>If the attorneys have to make decisions together and ‘act jointly’, the Lasting Power of Attorney will come to an end.</p>

<p>A property and financial affairs Lasting Power of Attorney will end if the attorney becomes bankrupt, unless there are other attorneys in place.</p>

</article><article id="if-you-have-an-enduring-power-of-attorney"><header><h1>Part 8: If you have an Enduring Power of Attorney</h1>
