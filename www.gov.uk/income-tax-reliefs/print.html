  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>‘Tax relief’ means that you either:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay less tax to take account of money you’ve spent on specific things, like business expenses if you’re self employed</li>
  <li>get tax back or get it repaid in another way, like into a personal pension</li>
</ul>
<p>You get some types of tax relief automatically - but some you must apply for.</p>

</article><article id="pension-contributions-tax-relief"><header><h1>Part 2: Pension contributions: tax relief</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You automatically get tax relief on contributions to your own pension.</p>
</div>

<p>How you get the tax relief depends on the type of pension scheme you’re paying into. </p>

<h2>Workplace pension schemes</h2>

<p>Your employer usually takes pension contributions from your pay before they take Income Tax away. </p>

<p>So you don’t pay Income Tax on your pension contributions (but you do pay National Insurance contributions on them). </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Some workplace pension schemes are run like personal pension schemes - ask your employer if you’re not sure which applies to you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Personal pensions</h2>

<p>You’ve already paid tax on the income you pay into a personal pension. </p>

<p>Your pension provider claims back Income Tax from government at the basic Income Tax rate of 20% and adds it to your pension pot.</p>

<p>This means for every £80 you pay into your pension, you end up with £100 in your pension pot. </p>

<p>If you pay Income Tax at the 40% rate, you can claim back the extra 20% tax you’ve paid on your pension contributions through your <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return</a> if you fill one in each year. </p>

<p>If you don’t, you call or write to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) to reclaim the extra tax you’ve paid.</p>

<br></p></div></div>

<p>If you pay Income Tax at the 50% rate, you can only claim the difference through your <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return.</a></p>

<h2>Limits on tax relief for pension contributions</h2>

<p>The maximum amount of pension contributions that you can get tax relief on in each tax year is the lower of:</p>

<ul>
<li>100% of your earnings</li>
  <li>£50,000</li>
</ul>
<p>You pay Income Tax on any pension contributions you make above the limit.</p>

<h2>If you don’t pay Income Tax</h2>

<p>If you don’t pay Income Tax because you’re on a low income, you still automatically get tax relief at 20% on the first £2,880 you pay into a pension each tax year. </p>

<h2>If you pay into someone else’s pension</h2>

<p>If you pay into someone else’s pension, like your partner or spouse, they can get tax relief on your contributions instead of you. </p>

<p>If it’s a personal pension, they’ll automatically get the 20% tax you’ve paid added to their pension pot.</p>

<p>If it’s an occupational or workplace pension scheme, check the scheme’s rules. If it allows you to make contributions for other people, the person you’re paying for may need to claim the tax relief. They should write to or call <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

</article><article id="self-employed-tax-relief"><header><h1>Part 3: Self employed: tax relief</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re self-employed (a sole trader or partner in a partnership), you get tax relief on what you spend running your business. </p>

<p>You only pay Income Tax and National Insurance contributions on your profits.</p>

<p>You claim tax relief by filling in your <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must claim within 5 years of the end of the tax year that you spent the money.</p>
</div>

<h2>Costs you can claim</h2>

<p>You can claim tax relief on money that you must spend to run your business. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>wages and salaries you pay to staff</li>
  <li>the cost of goods for your business (like stock for a retailer or materials for a builder)</li>
  <li>rent of business premises (like an office or shop)</li>
  <li>rent, rates, power and water your business premises uses</li>
  <li>motor and travel expenses if they’re only for business (like visiting customers or delivering goods)</li>
  <li>bad debts (money your business is owed but isn’t paid)</li>
  <li>losses your business made in previous tax years</li>
  <li>accountancy and professional fees</li>
  <li>advertising</li>
  <li>business bank, PayPal and credit card charges</li>

  <li>postage</li>
  <li>safety clothing that you need for your business</li>
</ul>
<h2>Costs you can’t claim</h2>

<p>You can’t claim ‘private expenditure’ - money you spend on things that aren’t directly related to your business. For example, you can’t claim:</p>

<ul>
<li>day-to-day living expenses, like food or clothing that isn’t related to work</li>
  <li>household expenses</li>
  <li>the amount you take as wages (sometimes called ‘drawings’)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you use something both personally and for business - eg a landline at home - you can only claim for the part of the cost that you’ve used for business.</p>
</div>

<h2>Equipment, machinery and property</h2>

<p>If you buy equipment or machinery for your business, or things like furniture that you expect to last, you must claim the cost of them in a different way. These are called <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/pimmanual/pim3005.htm" title="Capital allowances">‘capital allowances’</a></p>

</article><article id="charity-donations-tax-relief"><header><h1>Part 5: Charity donations: tax relief</h1>
  </header><p>Donations to charity get tax relief if you make them through either a:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gift Aid scheme</li>
  <li>Payroll Giving scheme</li>
</ul>
<h2>Donations through Gift Aid</h2>

<p>Charities and amateur sports clubs can register with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) to be part of the Gift Aid scheme. When they’re registered, they can claim back the tax you’ve already paid on your donation.</p>

<p>The charity or sports club will give you a form to sign. They must also have an <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> charity reference number - ask the charity or sports club if you’re not sure.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’ve paid less tax than the charity or sports club gets back, you may be asked to pay the tax to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you pay Income Tax at 40% or 50%</h3>

<p>You can claim back the difference between the tax you’ve paid on the donation and what the charity got back when you fill in your <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return.</a></p>

<h3>If you get age-related Personal Allowances or Married Couple’s Allowance</h3>

<p>If you get a higher tax-free Personal Allowance because you’re over 65 or you claim Married Couple’s Allowance, donations you make through Gift Aid may mean your tax-free allowances increase.</p>

<p>If you fill in a <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return</a>, your allowances will be adjusted automatically if they need to be.</p>

<p>If you don’t, call <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to tell them about your charity donations.</p>

</div>

<h2>Payroll Giving schemes</h2>

<p>If your employer or pension provider offers a Payroll Giving scheme, any donations you give through the scheme will be taken before Income Tax is taken off. </p>

<p>You’ll still pay National Insurance contributions on the amount of your donation. But you won’t pay any Income Tax on the amount you donate.</p>


</article><article id="maintenance-payments-tax-relief"><header><h1>Part 6: Maintenance payments: tax relief</h1>
