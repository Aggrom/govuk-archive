  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can get a divorce if you have been married at least a year and your relationship has irretrievably (permanently) broken down.</p>

<p>You must have a marriage that is legally recognised in the UK, and have a permanent home in England or Wales.</p>

<p>There are 3 main steps to getting divorced:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>File a divorce petition</strong> - you have to apply to the court for permission to divorce, and show reasons why you want the marriage to end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply for a decree nisi</strong> - if your spouse agrees to the petition, you’ll get a document saying there’s no reason you can’t divorce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply for a decree absolute</strong> - this legally ends your marriage - you need to wait 6 weeks after you get the decree nisi before you can apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Arrange your own divorce</h2>

<p>You may be able to arrange your own divorce without involving solicitors if you agree on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the reasons for a divorce</li>
  <li>how you’ll look after any children</li>
  <li>how you’ll split up money, property and possessions</li>
</ul>
<p>If you agree on these things beforehand, you won’t have to go to a court hearing, and the divorce paperwork should be fairly straightforward.</p>

</article><article id="grounds-for-divorce"><header><h1>Part 2: Grounds for divorce</h1>
  </header><p>You must show there are good reasons for ending your marriage.</p>

<p>You can give 5 grounds for a divorce:</p>

<h2>1. Adultery</h2>

<p>Your husband or wife had sex with someone else of the opposite sex, and you can no longer bear to live with them.</p>

<p>You can’t give adultery as a reason if you lived with your husband or wife for 6 months after you found out about it.</p>

<h2>2. Unreasonable behaviour</h2>

<p>Your husband or wife behaved so badly that you can no longer bear to live with them.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>physical violence</li>
  <li>verbal abuse, eg insults or threats</li>
  <li>drunkenness or drug-taking</li>
  <li>refusing to pay for housekeeping</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Desertion</h2>

<p>Your husband or wife has left you:</p>

<ul>
<li>without your agreement</li>
  <li>without a good reason</li>
  <li>to end your relationship</li>
  <li>for more than 2 years in the past 2½ years</li>
</ul>
<p>You can still claim desertion if you have lived together for up to a total of 6 months in this period.</p>

<h2>4. You have lived apart for more than 2 years</h2>

<p>You can get a divorce if you’ve lived apart for more than 2 years and both agree to the divorce.</p>

<p>Your husband or wife must agree in writing.</p>

<h2>5. You have lived apart for more than 5 years</h2>

<p>Living apart for more than 5 years is usually enough to get a divorce, even if your husband or wife disagrees with the divorce.</p>

</article><article id="respond-to-a-divorce-petition"><header><h1>Part 4: Respond to a divorce petition</h1>
  </header><p>If your husband or wife has started divorce proceedings against you, the court will send you a ‘divorce petition’.</p>

<p>You will also get:</p>

<ul>
<li>a notice of proceedings form</li>
  <li>an acknowledgment of service form</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep the notice of proceedings form, which tells you the case number and what you should do next. </p>

<p>You need to respond by filling in the acknowledgment of service form.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you don’t respond within 21 days, your husband or wife can continue with the divorce as if you’ve agreed.</p>
</div>

<h2>Agree with the divorce</h2>

<p>To agree with the divorce petition, fill in and return the acknowledgment of service form to the court within 8 days, and the divorce will go ahead.</p>

<h2>Disagree with the divorce</h2>

<p>To disagree with the divorce petition fill in the ‘acknowledgment of service’ form and return it within 8 days. Fill in the part that says you’re defending the divorce.</p>

<p>The court will send copies to your husband or wife.</p>

<p>After you return the form, you have up to 21 days to say why you are defending the divorce. This is called ‘giving an answer’.</p>

<p>To do this, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2651" title="answer to a divorce petition">answer to a divorce petition.</a></p>

<h2>Start your own divorce proceedings</h2>

<p>You may want to start your own divorce against your husband or wife - eg if you have evidence of their adultery or unreasonable behaviour. To do this, fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1115" title="divorce petition form">divorce petition form.</a></p>

<p>You may have to pay a £230 <a href="/court-fees-what-they-are/" title="court fee">court fee</a>.</p>

<h2>Court hearing</h2>

<p>When a divorce is defended or both sides file divorce petitions, the court will usually hold a hearing to discuss the case. </p>

<p>You and your husband or wife will usually have to attend to try to come to an agreement over the divorce.</p>

</div>

</article><article id="apply-for-decree-nisi"><header><h1>Part 5: Apply for decree nisi</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for a decree nisi if your husband or wife doesn’t defend your divorce petition.</p>

<p>A decree nisi is a document that says that the court doesn’t see any reason why you can’t divorce.</p>

<p>If your husband or wife doesn’t agree to the divorce, you can still apply for a decree nisi. However, you’ll have to go to a hearing at the court to discuss the case, where a judge will decide whether to grant you a decree nisi.</p>

<h2>Fill in application form</h2>

<p>To get a decree nisi, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=154" title="application for a decree nisi">application for a decree nisi.</a></p>

<p>If your husband or wife is defending the case, fill in section B of the form, saying you want a ‘case management hearing’ before the judge.</p>

<p>You must also fill in a statement confirming that what you said in your divorce petition is true.</p>

<p>There are 5 statement forms - use the one that covers the grounds you’ve given for your divorce:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=142" title="adultery statement">adultery statement</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=144" title="unreasonable behaviour statement">unreasonable behaviour statement</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=146" title="desertion statement">desertion statement</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=149" title="2 years' separation statement">2 years’ separation statement</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=150" title="5 years' separation statement">5 years’ separation statement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Attach a copy of your husband or wife’s response to the divorce petition.</p>

<h2>Getting a decree nisi</h2>

<p>If the judge agrees, the court will send you and your husband or wife:</p>

<ul>
<li>a certificate of entitlement to a decree</li>
  <li>a form saying that arrangements for children aren’t a reason to delay the divorce</li>
  <li>a decree nisi</li>
</ul>
<p>After 6 weeks you can apply for a ‘decree absolute’ to end the marriage.</p>

<h2>Your application is rejected</h2>

<p>You may be sent a ‘notice of refusal of judge’s certificate’ form, saying why you can’t divorce.</p>

<p>The form will tell you what to do next. The judge may want more information in writing, or you may have to go to a court hearing.</p>

</div>

</article><article id="apply-for-a-decree-absolute"><header><h1>Part 6: Apply for a decree absolute</h1>
  </header><p>The decree absolute is the legal document that ends your marriage.</p>

<p>You need to wait at least 6 weeks after the date of the decree nisi before you can apply for a decree absolute.</p>

<p>The delay gives you a chance to discuss finances and other issues with your husband or wife before the marriage comes to an end.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Apply within 12 months of getting the decree nisi - otherwise you will have to explain the delay to the court.</p>
</div>

<h2>Fill in application form</h2>

<p>To apply for a decree absolute, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1114" title="notice of application for decree nisi to be made absolute form">notice of application for decree nisi to be made absolute form.</a></p>

<p>A decree absolute costs £45.</p>

<h2>If your husband or wife started the divorce</h2>

<p>If your husband or wife started the divorce, and they haven’t already applied for a decree absolute, you can apply.</p>

<p>You can do this 3 months and 6 weeks after the date of the decree nisi.</p>

<p>You’ll have to fill in an <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=98" title="application notice form">application notice form,</a> pay a £90 fee and go to a court hearing with your husband or wife.</p>

<h2>Getting the decree absolute</h2>

<p>The court will check that: </p>

<ul>
<li>arrangements for children aren’t a reason to delay the divorce</li>
  <li>time limits have been met</li>
  <li>there are no other reasons not to grant the divorce</li>
</ul>
<p>The court will then send you both a decree absolute.</p>

<p>Once you get the decree absolute, you are divorced, no longer married and free to marry again if you wish.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Keep the decree absolute safe - you will need to show it if you remarry or to prove your marital status.</p>
