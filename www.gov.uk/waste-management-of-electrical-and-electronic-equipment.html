<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>These regulations aim to increase treatment and recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>), and reduce the amount of <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> that goes to landfill. They place a number of duties on producers including joining an approved producer compliance scheme, providing information to the scheme, labelling products with a crossed-out wheeled bin symbol and producer identification mark, making information available to consumers and waste treatment and reprocessing facilities, and providing your producer registration number to customers and suppliers.</p>

<p>This guide explains when the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations apply to your products, when a product is exempt and how you must meet your <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> responsibilities.</p>

<h2 id="check-whether-weee-producer-responsibilities-apply-to-you">Check whether <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> producer responsibilities apply to you</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations apply to businesses that produce electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>). You are defined as a producer if you put <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> on the UK market by:</p>

<ul>
<li>manufacturing and selling <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> under your own brand</li>
  <li>reselling <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> products produced by another supplier under your own brand (rebranding)</li>
  <li>importing or exporting <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> into the UK or another European Union member state on a professional basis</li>
</ul>
<p>The regulations apply to all producers regardless of their size.</p>

<p>If you distribute, sell or use <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>, or deal with <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>, you also have legal duties. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1082900055&amp;r.l3=1087159649&amp;topicId=1082900279"><abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3 id="check-if-your-products-are-affected">Check if your products are affected</h3>

<p>There are a number of steps you should follow when assessing whether your products are covered by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. You need to check:</p>

<ol>
<li>the product’s power source and voltage rating</li>
  <li>whether the product falls into one of ten <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> categories</li>
  <li>whether it’s been put on the UK market </li>
  <li>whether the product is a finished product or a spare, sub-assembly or component</li>
  <li>whether it falls under an exemption</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/EEE_Scope_Guidance_V3_0_March_2010_-_Final.pdf">download guidance on when products are affected by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 571KB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="check-the-power-source-and-voltage-of-your-product">Check the power source and voltage of your product</h2>

<p>You need to check the power source and voltage of your product to see whether it is within the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="power-source">Power source</h3>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, a product must use electric currents or electromagnetic fields as its primary energy source in order to work properly, or must serve to generate, transfer or measure electric currents. For example, a massage chair requires electricity to provide its main purpose of giving a massage, so it’s within the scope of the regulations.</p>

<p>However, if your product doesn’t need electricity to provide its main purpose, it is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. For example, a gas cooker may use electricity for a timer and clock, but its primary energy source is gas. Similarly, a talking toy may use batteries to allow it to talk, but it can still perform its primary purpose of being a toy without the batteries.</p>

<h3 id="voltage-rating">Voltage rating</h3>

<p>Your product will fall under the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>needs or generates 1,000 volts or less for alternating current</li>
  <li>needs or generates 1,500 volts for direct current</li>
</ul>
<p>If your product has been designed for use with a voltage rating of more than this, you do not need to comply with the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="the-next-step">The next step</h3>

<p>If your product’s power source and voltage rating fall under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, check whether it falls within one of the ten product categories.</p>

<p>If you believe that your product is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, it is highly recommended that you keep relevant documentation to explain your decision.</p>

<h2 id="check-product-categories">Check product categories</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations may apply to your products if they fall into one of the following ten categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Category 1 - large household appliances, eg fridges, radiators and air conditioning appliances</li>
  <li>Category 2 - small household appliances, eg sewing machines, toasters and clocks</li>
  <li>Category 3 - IT and telecommunications equipment, eg computers and their accessories, calculators and phones</li>
  <li>Category 4 - consumer equipment, eg TVs, radios and musical instruments</li>
  <li>Category 5 - lighting equipment, eg fluorescent lamps and non-household luminaires</li>
  <li>Category 6 - electrical and electronic tools, eg drills, welding equipment and lawnmowers</li>
  <li>Category 7 - toys, leisure and sports equipment, eg electric train sets, video games and slot machines</li>
  <li>Category 8 - medical devices, eg dialysis machines, ventilators and radiotherapy equipment</li>
  <li>Category 9 - monitoring and control instruments, eg smoke detectors, thermostats and other instruments used in industrial installations</li>
  <li>Category 10 - automatic dispensers, eg drinks, food and money dispensers</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3289/schedule/2/made">Find examples of products covered by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulation categories on the Legislation.gov.uk website</a>.</p>

<p>If your products do not fall into any of these categories, or if it qualifies for an exemption, you may not need to comply with the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. Note that even if a product doesn’t obviously fit into a category it could still be affected by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="the-next-step-1">The next step</h3>

<p>If your product falls under one of the ten categories, check whether it’s been put on the UK market.</p>

<p>If you believe that your product is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, it is highly recommended that you keep relevant documentation to explain your decision.</p>

<h2 id="check-if-you-put-your-products-on-the-uk-market">Check if you put your products on the UK market</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations only cover products that you make available for the first time in the UK. This involves transferring a product from manufacture or import, in order to distribute or use it. It also includes transfers of second-hand items that have not previously been available in the UK. A product transfer can be a physical handover or a transfer of ownership.</p>

<p>A transfer can take place in a number of different ways, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>sale, loan, hire, lease and gift</li>
  <li>from a UK manufacturer to a UK distributor</li>
  <li>from a UK manufacturer to the final consumer or user in the UK</li>
  <li>from a manufacturer outside the UK to an importer in the UK, or to the person responsible for distributing the item in the UK</li>
  <li>from an authorised representative to the final user or consumer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="products-that-are-not-on-the-market">Products that are not on the market</h3>

<p>You have not put a product on the market if it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>manufactured solely for in-house use</li>
  <li>produced as a prototype or demonstration sample - unless supplied to a customer for use</li>
  <li>manufactured in the UK but exported outside the UK - unless you put the product on the market by distance communication in another European Union member state or in Iceland, Norway or Liechtenstein</li>
</ul>
<p>If your product hasn’t been put on the market, you do not need to comply with the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. However, it is advisable to keep documentation that explains your reasons for deciding your product is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. </p>

<h3 id="the-next-step-2">The next step</h3>

<p>If your product has been put on the market in the UK, you must check if your product is a final product or a spare, sub-assembly or component.</p>

<h2 id="final-products-spares-sub-assemblies-and-components">Final products, spares, sub-assemblies and components</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations apply to finished products. They do not apply to most spare parts, sub-assemblies and components.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-weee-regulations-define-a-finished-product">How the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations define a finished product</h3>

<p>A finished product is a device or piece of equipment that:</p>

<ul>
<li>an end user can operate with only simple adjustments or connections</li>
  <li>has its own enclosure and, if applicable, ports and connections intended for end users</li>
</ul>
<p>However, deciding whether a product is a finished product is not always straightforward. For instance, not all finished products need their own enclosure. Examples of products covered by <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scart leads or power leads fall within the definition of <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> and could be considered to fall within the scope of <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> category 3.</li>
  <li>A computer keyboard, mouse and screen are considered finished products in their own right, despite technically being components of a computer system - each fall within the definition of <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> and fall into <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> category 3.</li>
  <li>A cordless drill’s battery pack and charger fall within the definition of <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>, but on their own they do not appear to fall into any of the 10 <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> categories and so are outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. However, because their primary function is to enable a cordless drill to work properly, when placed on the market or discarded as <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> together with the cordless drill, they fall into the host item’s <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> category 6. Therefore, they are not considered to be a final product on their own, only when alongside the cordless drill.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your product is a finished product, you must check that it falls under one of the ten equipment categories.</p>

<p>If it is not a finished product, check if it is a spare part, sub-assembly or component.</p>

<h3 id="spare-parts">Spare parts</h3>

<p>Spare parts aren’t products in their own right but items provided to repair other products after they have been put on the market. If you put a repaired product on the UK market without changing its original performance, purpose or type, it won’t fall within the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations because it’s not a new product.</p>

<p>If you add a spare part to a product to modify its original purpose, performance or type, it may be considered a new product. If you then put it on the market in the UK, it may fall within the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="sub-assemblies">Sub-assemblies</h3>

<p>Sub-assemblies are packages of components assembled into individual units, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>populated mother boards</li>
  <li>light sensors and control units used in a street light</li>
  <li>display panels in hand-held gas monitors</li>
</ul>
<p>If your product is a sub-assembly, it does not fall within the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="components">Components</h3>

<p>Components are the separate items that must be assembled to enable a finished product to work. They are not finished products in themselves. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>resistors, transistors, capacitors and diodes</li>
  <li>internal wiring</li>
  <li>simple switches</li>
</ul>
<p>If you produce components and place them on the market as separate items, they are outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. However, components included as part of a finished product that’s placed on the market or discarded are covered by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="the-next-step-3">The next step</h3>

<p>If your products are covered by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, then you must comply with <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> producer responsibilities. If you’re unsure whether your products are covered, contact the Environment Agency Helpline on Tel 03708 506 506 for advice.</p>

<p>If you believe that your product is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, it is highly recommended that you keep relevant documentation to explain your decision. </p>

<h2 id="exemptions-under-the-weee-regulations">Exemptions under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations</h2>

<p>Some <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> you produce may be exempt from the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>consumables</li>
  <li>products designed specifically for military and national security purposes</li>
  <li>equipment that is part of equipment which falls outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations</li>
  <li>luminaires in households and filament light bulbs</li>
  <li>implanted and infected medical products</li>
  <li>large-scale stationary industrial tools</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consumables">Consumables</h3>

<p><abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> consumables do not generally come under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, unless they are part of another product that is covered. For example, an ink cartridge on its own is not <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>, but if it’s inside a discarded printer it becomes part of that product and is covered by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<p>However, some consumables - such as security tags - can be <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> and therefore do come under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="military-and-national-security-products">Military and national security products</h3>

<p>Arms, weapons, ammunition and other products used in warfare are exempt from the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. However, if your product is not designed exclusively for military purposes, the exemption does not apply. For example, computer, office or catering equipment supplied to the military or the security services would fall within the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="the-next-step-4">The next step</h3>

<p>If your product falls under one of the ten <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulation categories and none of the above exemptions apply, you must comply with the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. </p>

<p>If your product is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, it is highly recommended that you keep relevant documentation to explain your decision.  </p>

<p>If you are unsure whether your product is covered by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, contact the Environment Agency Helpline on Tel 03708 506 506.</p>

<h2 id="complying-with-weee-producer-responsibilities">Complying with <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> producer responsibilities</h2>

<p>If you produce, rebrand or import <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> and your products fall under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, you must comply with certain responsibilities.</p>

<h3 id="producer-compliance-schemes-pcss">Producer compliance schemes (<abbr title="Producer compliance schemes">PCSs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>All <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> producers must join a <abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr>. If you fail to do so you can be prosecuted and fined up to £5,000 in a magistrates’ court, or an unlimited amount in a Crown Court.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr> will be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>registering your business as a producer with the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>reporting the <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> you place on the UK market</li>
  <li>arranging the collection of household <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> from designated collection facilities or other established collection networks</li>
  <li>arranging the treatment and recovery of <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>providing evidence that you have complied with your <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> treatment and recovery obligations</li>
  <li>providing advice on complying with obligations regarding household and non-household <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to pay the <abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr> for collecting, treating, recovering and disposing of the same amount of household <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> that you place on the UK market. There are separate collection and funding arrangements for non-household equipment. </p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32086.aspx">find a list of approved <abbr title="Producer compliance schemes">PCSs</abbr> on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-eee-producer-responsibilities">Other <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> producer responsibilities</h3>

<p>In addition, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>label your products correctly</li>
  <li>make information available to <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> treatment and reprocessing facilities about how to dismantle and recycle your products at the end of their life</li>
  <li>give your producer registration number to distributors you supply equipment to</li>
  <li>keep records for at least four years, including the amounts of <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> placed on the UK market and sales to end users in other member states</li>
  <li>comply with restrictions on the use of hazardous substances - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/restriction-of-the-use-of-certain-hazardous-substances-in-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-rohs">restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment">ROHS</abbr>)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marking-your-products-under-the-weee-regulations">Marking your products under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations</h2>

<p>If you produce, rebrand or import <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> which falls under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, you must mark it with:</p>

<ul>
<li>the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol - so householders know not to dispose of the product with their unsorted household waste</li>
  <li>a producer identification mark</li>
  <li>a date mark</li>
</ul>
<p>These marks should be clearly visible and permanent, and should be on the product itself. However, if this is not possible - eg because the product is too small or if this would affect its function - you can print the marking on the packaging, instructions or warranty.</p>

<p>The British Standards Institution (BSI) has published a European standard on <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> marking that you can use. <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030142395">Buy the European standard on <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> marking on the BSI website</a>. Alternatively, you can call BSI Standards and Publications on Tel 020 8996 9001.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.valpak.co.uk/Libraries/WEEE_Compliance/cenelec_report.sflb.ashx">download <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> marking guidance from the Valpak website (PDF, 104K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="marking-household-products">Marking household products</h3>

<p>For household products, you can no longer show purchasers the cost of collecting, treating and recovering the product when it reaches the end of its life. This applies from 13 February 2013 for large household appliances.</p>

<p>The displayed cost must:</p>

<ul>
<li>not exceed the actual cost of collecting, treating, recovering and reprocessing an equivalent item of historic <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>explain how it’s been calculated - you can put these details on your website and provide purchasers with the web address</li>
  <li>be clearly identified so people don’t confuse it with the product’s purchase price</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="financing-and-take-back-arrangements-for-weee">Financing and take-back arrangements for <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you produce, rebrand or import <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>, and your products fall under the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, you must join a producer compliance scheme (<abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr>). Through the <abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr> you must finance the collection, treatment and recovery of the future waste created by your products.</p>

<h3 id="household-weee">Household <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr> will deal with separately collected household <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> on your behalf. The <abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr> calculates the amount you pay for this, based on the amount of equipment that you sell and what is collected through designated collection sites. </p>

<h3 id="non-household-weee">Non-household <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you sell <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> for non-household use, either you or your <abbr title="Producer compliance scheme">PCS</abbr> is responsible for collecting, treating and recycling:</p>

<ul>
<li>waste that is being replaced by the products you sell - this only applies if the equipment was originally purchased from you or another producer before 13 August 2005</li>
  <li>equipment you have sold since 13 August 2005, when it is discarded as waste</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can negotiate an agreement with customers that buy non-household <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>. This kind of agreement can be part of normal contract negotiations and can allow customers to take responsibility for waste that they are replacing, or for new equipment that becomes <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> at the end of its life.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-the-weee-regulations-dont-apply">What to do if the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations don’t apply</h2>

<p>If one or more of your products is not covered by the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, it is recommended that you keep documentation which explains your reasons for this decision. If this is difficult, it may be because your product is covered by the regulations. You should go back and check that your product really is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations. </p>

<p>You should also remember that if the intended use of your product changes, you will need to review whether this change will bring it within the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<p>It’s also a good idea to make sure that your sales staff understand and can explain why your business doesn’t have to comply with marking or financing responsibilities for any product that you have decided is outside the scope of the <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>
