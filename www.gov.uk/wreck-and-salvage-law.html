<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are thousands of wrecked vessels and aircraft around the UK coast. Many wreck sites are protected for their historic importance or because they are considered dangerous.</p>

<p>If you recover wreck material within UK territorial waters, or bring wreck material into UK territorial waters, you must report it to the Receiver of Wreck.</p>

<p>This guide explains the roles and responsibilities of the Receiver of Wreck and the law relating to wreck and salvage. You will also find information about the responsibilities and rights of wreck owners and salvors, and how to report wreck material. There are also contact details for organisations that can provide help, advice and information on wrecks.</p>

<h2 id="responsibilities-of-the-receiver-of-wreck">Responsibilities of the Receiver of Wreck</h2>

<p>In the UK, the Receiver of Wreck administers the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 in relation to wreck and salvage. The Receiver is appointed directly by the Secretary of State and the post of Receiver of Wreck currently sits within the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>). The Receiver is responsible for processing incoming reports of wreck and ensures that the interests of both salvor and owner are taken into consideration by:</p>

<ul>
<li>researching and establishing who owns the wreck</li>
  <li>liaising with the finder and owner, and other interested parties such as archaeologists and museums</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="definition-of-wreck">Definition of wreck</h3>

<p>According to section 255 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the definition of wreck includes “jetsam, flotsam, lagan and derelict found in or on the shores of the sea or any tidal water”.</p>

<h3 id="jetsam-flotsam-lagan-and-derelict">Jetsam, flotsam, lagan and derelict</h3>

<p>Jetsam describes goods cast overboard to lighten a vessel in danger of sinking. The vessel may still perish.</p>

<p>Flotsam describes goods lost from a ship which has sunk or otherwise perished. Goods are recoverable because they remain afloat.</p>

<p>Lagan describes goods cast overboard from a ship which afterwards perishes. The goods are buoyed so they can be recovered.</p>

<p>Derelict describes property, whether vessel or cargo, which has been abandoned and deserted at sea by those who were in charge of it without any hope of recovering it.</p>

<p>If a boat comes off its moorings, it is not generally classified as a wreck for the purposes of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, as it has not been abandoned without hope of recovery.</p>

<p>Also, buoys such as data buoys and mooring buoys are not classed as wreck. However, buoys which form part of fishing equipment may be classed as wreck when adrift.</p>

<h3 id="the-receivers-remit-and-duties">The Receiver’s remit and duties</h3>

<p>The Receiver’s remit is set down in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Part IX. This covers wreck from UK territorial waters, and wreck brought into the UK from outside UK territorial waters.</p>

<p>The Receiver’s remit extends to tidal waters in the UK, so it does not cover lakes or rivers beyond tidal reach.</p>

<p>The Receiver aims to give owners the opportunity of having their property returned and to make sure a fair salvage award payment is made where necessary. The Receiver will also recover any costs paid from the public purse during this process.</p>

<p>The Receiver is required to notify Lloyds of recovered property considered to be worth more than £5,000.</p>

<h3 id="the-duties-and-rights-of-the-salvor">The duties and rights of the salvor</h3>

<p>If you recover wreck material, you must declare it to the Receiver. Finders should report their recoveries by submitting a completed Report of Wreck and Salvage Form within 28 days of the recovery. You should give a full description of the wreck and will usually be asked to hold recovered material to the Receiver’s order. </p>

<h3 id="the-duties-and-rights-of-wreck-owners">The duties and rights of wreck owners</h3>

<p>If you own a wreck, you must prove ownership to the satisfaction of the Receiver where wreck material has been recovered and reported. You must provide proof of ownership within one year of the material being reported. You will be entitled to have your property back as soon as you have paid any due expenses and an appropriate salvage award.</p>

<h3 id="unclaimed-wreck">Unclaimed wreck</h3>

<p>If wreck from UK waters remains unclaimed at the end of one year, it becomes the property of the Crown or grantee of the Crown such as the Duchy of Cornwall.</p>

<p>If you believe you are entitled to unclaimed wreck, you must provide evidence of entitlement to the satisfaction of the Receiver.</p>

<p>If wreck from UK territorial waters is unclaimed at the end of one year, the Receiver will dispose of the find on behalf of the Crown. If wreck from outside UK territorial waters is unclaimed at the end of one year, the Crown makes no claim.</p>

<h3 id="salvage-awards">Salvage awards</h3>

<p>A salvor, acting properly under the law, is likely to be entitled to a salvage award. This salvage award cannot exceed the salved value of the recovered material.</p>

<p>The Receiver can arrange for independent valuations to help owners and finders agree on a fair salvage award.</p>

<p>Other factors are also taken into account when determining salvage awards, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the measure of success obtained by the salvor</li>
  <li>the skills and efforts of the salvor</li>
  <li>the nature and degree of danger</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wreck-law">Wreck law</h3>

<p>Some wrecks are also covered by other pieces of legislation including the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 or the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. </p>

<p>The Receiver of Wreck is responsible for enforcing the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 in relation to wreck and salvage and actively monitors diving and salvage activities as well as informing and educating sea users of their responsibilities.</p>

<p>The Receiver works closely with other government departments and heritage organisations involved in matters related to wreck.</p>

<p>The Respect our Wrecks initiative is a PADI, BSAC and SAA initiative supported by the Receiver. It highlights the concern for sensitive and correct behaviour by all divers when visiting wreck sites. These three main diving organisations have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to implement best practice in matters of wreck.</p>

<h2 id="the-law-relating-to-wreck">The law relating to wreck</h2>

<p>In the UK, there are three main laws which apply to shipwrecks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Merchant Shipping Act 1995</li>
  <li>Protection of Wrecks Act 1973</li>
  <li>Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on where the wreck site is, the Ancient Monuments &amp; Archaeological Areas Act 1979 may also apply.</p>

<h3 id="merchant-shipping-act-1995">Merchant Shipping Act 1995</h3>

<p>Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, you must report to the Receiver of Wreck all wreck material recovered from UK territorial waters and any wreck material brought into the UK from outside UK territorial waters. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>wreck material found in or on the sea</li>
  <li>wreck material washed ashore in tidal waters</li>
  <li>material recovered from a wreck site - regardless of age, size or apparent importance or value</li>
</ul>
<p>When you report recovered wreck material to the Receiver, you may be entitled to a salvage award.</p>

<h3 id="protection-of-wrecks-act-1973">Protection of Wrecks Act 1973</h3>

<p>Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 is designed to protect wrecks which are of historic, archaeological or artistic importance. This is administered by National Heritage organisations on behalf of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (<abbr title="Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>).</p>

<p>When a wreck is protected under this legislation, there is a protected area around the designated site and diving is prohibited unless an appropriate licence has been issued by the relevant National Heritage Agency.</p>

<p>Section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act covers wrecks considered as being potentially dangerous and is administered by the Receiver of Wreck through the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>In the interest of safety, there is a strict no-entry policy for wrecks considered dangerous because of their contents. These wrecks have a prohibited area around them.</p>

<h3 id="protection-of-military-remains-act-1986">Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</h3>

<p>The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 deals with wrecks of both aircraft and ships, and all military aircraft is automatically protected under this legislation. This act is administered by the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) - RAF for aircraft, Navy for vessels.</p>

<p>Under this act, vessels may be designated either as a protected place or as a controlled site. Divers may visit a protected place on a ‘look but don’t touch’ basis, however they are prohibited from visiting controlled sites.</p>

<h2 id="the-process-of-reporting-wreck">The process of reporting wreck</h2>

<p>Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, you must report to the Receiver of Wreck all wreck material (regardless of size or significance) recovered from within UK territorial waters - up to the 12 nautical mile limit - or recovered outside the UK and brought within UK territorial waters. Reporting wreck is a simple process. You just need to complete a Report of Wreck and Salvage Form and send it to the Receiver of Wreck.</p>

<p>Wreck material can take many forms, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>portholes</li>
  <li>bells</li>
  <li>compasses</li>
  <li>fixtures and fittings</li>
  <li>personal belongings</li>
  <li>cargo material</li>
  <li>aircraft</li>
  <li>medieval pots, gold coins, cannon etc</li>
</ul>
<p>If wreck material comes from non-tidal waters, it is treated as if it was found on land and falls under other legislation, such as the Treasure Act 1996, or the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.</p>

<h3 id="settlement-of-salvage">Settlement of salvage</h3>

<p>When you report a find - whether modern or historic material - to the Receiver, you may be entitled to a salvage award.</p>

<h3 id="settlement-of-ownership">Settlement of ownership</h3>

<p>When you report wreck material to the Receiver, wreck owners are given the opportunity to be reunited with their property, and the salvor may receive a salvage award.</p>

<h3 id="find-out-who-owns-wreck-items">Find out who owns wreck items</h3>

<p>The Receiver investigates ownership of wreck items. If you find wreck, you should assume that it has an owner, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>an individual</li>
  <li>a company or insurance company</li>
  <li>a dive club</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> or the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department of Transport">DfT</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>An owner has one year after the Report Form is received in which to come forward and prove ownership of the property. During this time, the finder is normally allowed to hold the wreck on indemnity to the Receiver of Wreck.</p>

<p>If an owner decides that they would like their property returned, they will first have to settle salvage with the legal finder of the material. </p>

<h3 id="historic-wreck-material">Historic wreck material</h3>

<p>When material of historical or archaeological importance is reported, the Receiver may seek further advice from experts in a related field. For wreck material that is of historical or archaeological importance, the Receiver of Wreck will try to ensure that it is offered to an appropriate museum. If you find historic wreck material, your views will be taken into consideration when placing the material in a museum and you may still be entitled to a salvage award.</p>

<h3 id="fees-and-forms">Fees and forms</h3>

<p>The Receiver does not currently charge a fee, but will expect to recover any expenses incurred such as storage or obtaining a valuation of the salved property.</p>

<p>If you recover any wreck material, you will need to complete a Report of Wreck and Salvage Form and send it to the Receiver within 28 days of the recovery. Both you and a witness should sign a hard copy of the form before returning it to the Receiver. Download a Report of Wreck and Salvage Form from the <a rel="external" href="https://afrmmcanet.mcga.gov.uk/formspublic/ROW/MSF6200.pdf"><abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 174KB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="receiver-of-wreck---enforcement-and-penalties">Receiver of Wreck - enforcement and penalties</h2>

<p>The Receiver of Wreck tries to ensure the fair treatment of both legal salvors and legal owners. They also expect all sea and coast users to abide by the law when recovering wreck.</p>

<p>The Receiver will investigate any report of possible offences regarding the treatment of wreck. If the investigation reveals sufficient evidence, the Receiver may prosecute those suspected of having committed an offence.</p>

<p>The Receiver may share information with other prosecuting authorities, for instance, when offences come to light in relation to the Theft Act 1968 or the Firearms Act 1968.</p>

<h3 id="summary-of-offences-and-penalties">Summary of offences and penalties</h3>

<p>Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, there are offences for illegal activity which carry penalties, for example:</p>

<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="time-limit-for-declaring-recovered-wreck-material">Time limit for declaring recovered wreck material</h3>

<p>The Receiver considers that 28 days is a reasonable time for a finder to declare wreck by completing and submitting a Report of Wreck and Salvage Form. Download Report of Wreck and Salvage Form from the <a rel="external" href="https://afrmmcanet.mcga.gov.uk/formspublic/ROW/MSF6200.pdf"><abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 174KB)</a>.</p>

<p>If you recover wreck material and require more time to declare it, you may apply to the Receiver in writing, giving details of the reasons why.</p>

<p>However, if a find is not registered within 28 days, or a request for an extension is considered unreasonable, the Receiver may, without further notification, commence proceedings under section 236(2).</p>

<h3 id="monitoring-diving-activities">Monitoring diving activities</h3>

<p>Where possible the Receiver monitors diving activities in conjunction with Ministry of Defence, Police, Coastguard, Diving Organisations and other interested parties, and will continue to educate all sea-users through leaflets, presentations and visits.</p>

<h2 id="protected-wrecks">Protected wrecks</h2>

<p>Around the coast of the UK there are more than 100 wreck sites designated as protected wrecks by one of three main pieces of legislation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Protection of Wrecks Act 1973</li>
  <li>Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</li>
  <li>Ancient Monuments &amp; Archaeological Areas Act 1979</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-1-of-the-protection-of-wrecks-act-1973">Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973</h3>

<p>Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 provides protection for designated wrecks which are deemed to be important by virtue of their historical, archaeological or artistic value.</p>

<p>You can find page one of a list of protected wrecks designated under Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-receiverofwreck/mcga-protectedwrecks/mcga-protectedwrecks-wrecksact1973_1.htm"><abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Diving at these sites is prohibited unless an appropriate licence has been issued by the relevant National Heritage Agency.</p>

<p>There are four levels of licence:</p>

<ul>
<li>visitor licence</li>
  <li>survey licence</li>
  <li>surface recovery licence</li>
  <li>excavation licence</li>
</ul>
<p>The administration of Section 1 of this Act and associated licences is the responsibility of:</p>

<ul>
<li>English Heritage in England</li>
  <li>Historic Scotland in Scotland</li>
  <li>Cadw in Wales</li>
  <li>Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-2-of-the-protection-of-wrecks-act-1973">Section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973</h3>

<p>Section 2 of the Protection of Wrecks Act provides protection for wrecks that are designated as dangerous because of their contents. It is administered by the Receiver of Wreck through the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Diving on these wrecks is strictly prohibited.</p>

<h3 id="the-protection-of-military-remains-act-1986">The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986</h3>

<p>The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 makes it an offence to interfere without a licence with the wreckage of any crashed, sunken or stranded military aircraft or designated vessel. This is irrespective of loss of life or whether the loss occurred during peacetime or wartime.</p>

<p>You can find wrecks designated as military remains on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2616/contents/made">Legislation.gov website</a>.</p>

<p>Download a list of crashed military aircraft of historical interest from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/2318DD7B-2DDC-41E0-8D35-7AD12333A1C4/0/POMRACTBOOKLET_Jun09.pdf"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> website (PDF, 63KB</a>.</p>

<p>All crashed military aircraft receive automatic protection, but vessels must be individually designated. Wrecked vessels are protected under this Act both in UK waters and abroad.</p>

<p>There are two levels of protection offered by this Act, designation as a protected place or as a controlled site.</p>

<h3 id="protected-places">Protected places</h3>

<p>The designation of protected places includes the remains of any aircraft which crashed while in military service or any vessel which sank or stranded in military service after 4 August 1914.</p>

<p>Although crashed military aircraft receive automatic status as a protected place, vessels need to be specifically designated by name. The location of the wreck does not need to be known for it to be designated as a protected place.</p>

<p>You are allowed to dive on an aircraft or vessel designated as a protected place, on a ‘look but do not touch’ basis only, however it is an offence to:</p>

<ul>
<li>conduct unlicensed diving or salvage operations</li>
  <li>tamper with, damage, remove or unearth any remains</li>
  <li>enter any hatch or other opening</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="controlled-sites">Controlled sites</h3>

<p>Controlled sites are specifically designated areas which cover the remains of a military aircraft or a vessel sunk or stranded in military service within the last 200 years.</p>

<p>Within a controlled site, diving operations are prohibited unless you are authorised by a specific licence. It is also an offence to:</p>

<ul>
<li>conduct diving, salvage or excavation operations for the purposes of investigating or recording the remains</li>
  <li>tamper with, damage, move or unearth any remains</li>
  <li>enter any hatch or opening</li>
</ul>
<p>You can obtain further information on this Act and its administration by contacting the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="ancient-monuments-and-archaeological-areas-act-1979">Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979</h3>

<p>The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 relates primarily to land-based sites and structures and provides for the scheduling of monuments of national importance.</p>

<p>In recent years, this act has also been used to provide some level of protection for underwater sites.</p>

<p>Once a wreck has been scheduled a maritime monument, public access to it - ie diving on the site - is permitted on a ‘look but do not touch’ basis. Without scheduled monument consent, it is an offence to:</p>

<ul>
<li>demolish</li>
  <li>destroy</li>
  <li>alter or repair</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, only suitably robust sites are likely to be scheduled, such as the remains of the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. Contact the relevant National Heritage Agency for further information.</p>

<h3 id="other-types-of-protected-wrecks">Other types of protected wrecks</h3>

<p>There are restrictions on other wrecks not covered by the legislation above, for example by harbour authorities or by directives issued by the Secretary of State’s representative for maritime salvage and intervention.</p>

<p>You can find the most up-to-date list of protected wrecks by contacting the appropriate authority. </p>

<p>Any artefact that is recovered from a protected wreck site under licence to the Secretary of State must still be reported to the Receiver of Wreck.</p>
