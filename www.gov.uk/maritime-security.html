<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The maritime community has a series of special measures to enhance maritime security. These are contained in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (<abbr title="International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea">SOLAS</abbr>) Chapter XI-2 and the International Ship and Port Facility (<abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr>) Code.</p>

<p>The EU regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security transposes <abbr title="International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea">SOLAS</abbr> XI-2 and the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code into UK law and requires EU member states to introduce effective sanctions for breaching provisions of the regulation.</p>

<p>This guide explains how maritime security is managed in the UK, how security measures are applied and how you should comply with them. It also provides guidance on how to deal with stowaways and deter acts of violence against merchant ships, such as piracy and armed robbery.</p>

<p>You can find guidance on complying with European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) inspections of ships and shipping companies, and information on maritime security training. It also explains how Ship Identification Numbers (<abbr title="Ship Identification Numbers">SINs</abbr>) and Continuous Synopsis Records (<abbr title="Continuous Synopsis Records">CSRs</abbr>) work.</p>

<h2 id="maritime-security-management">Maritime security management</h2>

<p>The Security Policy Branch is part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>) and co-ordinates a series of special measures to ensure security in the maritime community.</p>

<h3 id="the-mca-security-policy-branch">The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> Security Policy Branch</h3>

<p>The Security Policy Branch provides technical advice and guidance to make sure that <abbr title="International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea">SOLAS</abbr> Chapter XI-2 and <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code are consistently applied and maintained.</p>

<h3 id="the-department-for-transport-and-the-mca-security-policy-branch">The Department for Transport and the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> Security Policy Branch</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> is responsible for security across all forms of transport, including maritime.</p>

<p>As policy leaders and advisers, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> implements measures in UK ports and on UK-registered ships carrying more than 12 passengers to ensure that security arrangements meet UK standards.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-shipsregsandguidance/mcga_dops_maritimesecurity_mainpage/dops_maritimesecurity-transeccontactdetails.htm">Find <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> contact details on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> is responsible to <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
<li>implementing the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code for all UK-registered cargo ships</li>
  <li>undertaking security aspects of Port State Control (<abbr title="Port State Control">PSC</abbr>) inspections of foreign vessels in UK ports, including passenger ships where this is a logical extension of the <abbr title="Port State Control">PSC</abbr> inspection</li>
  <li>receiving and handling ship security alerts in line with agreed standard operating procedures</li>
  <li>approving and auditing training providers for Ship Security Officer (<abbr title="Ship Security Officer">SSO</abbr>) and Company Security Officer (<abbr title="Company Security Officer">CSO</abbr>) courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code is a comprehensive set of measures designed to strengthen the security of ships and port facilities.</p>

<p>It is implemented through the EU regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security (725/2004). The code has two parts, one mandatory (Part A) and one recommendatory (Part B). The EU regulation makes some of Part B of the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code mandatory.</p>

<p>The code takes the approach that ensuring the security of ships and port facilities is a risk management activity and that, to determine what security measures are appropriate, an assessment of the risks must be made in each particular case.</p>

<p>The purpose of the code is to provide a standardised, consistent framework for evaluating risk. This enables governments to counteract changes in threat with changes in vulnerability for ships and port facilities by adopting the appropriate security levels and corresponding security measures.</p>

<p>For further information, you can call the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> Security Policy Branch on 023 8032 9478 or email them at <a href="mailto:HQ_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk">HQ_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ship-security-plans">Ship Security Plans</h2>

<p>To comply with the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code requirements, every company/ship must have a Ship Security Plan (<abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr>). As a minimum, this must address the requirements in paragraph A/9.4 and B/9.2 (made mandatory by EU regulation) of the code.</p>

<p>The purpose of an <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr> is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>help prevent illegal acts against the ship, crew and passengers</li>
  <li>minimise damage to the marine environment and port facilities</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Ship Security Plans">SSPs</abbr> for UK-registered vessels must be approved by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>, except for passenger ships, which are approved by the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>).</p>

<p>When you submit an <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr> it must be accompanied by a <abbr title="Ship Security Assessment">SSA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Ship Security Assessment">SSA</abbr> is an essential and integral part of the process of developing and updating an <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-shipsregsandguidance/mcga_dops_maritimesecurity_mainpage/dops_ms-guidance/mcga_dops_msb_ssp/ncga_dops_msb_guidance_ship_security_plans.htm">Read the full requirements of an <abbr title="Ship Security Assessment">SSA</abbr> at each security level on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>To get an idea of how to develop your <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/msf_5616_rev_1.0-3.doc">download a model <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr> from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (DOC, 236KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Cargo Ship Security Instructions show <abbr title="Company Security Officers">CSOs</abbr> for UK-registered cargo ships what must be contained within <abbr title="Ship Security Plans">SSPs</abbr>. For a copy of the Cargo Ship Security Instructions, email the Security Policy Branch at <a href="mailto:hq_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk">hq_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You should send your <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr> to your assigned security liaison officer for approval. There is no charge applicable for approving <abbr title="Ship Security Plans">SSPs</abbr> at present.</p>

<h3 id="ship-security-alert-systems-ssas">Ship Security Alert Systems (<abbr title="Ship Security Alert Systems">SSAS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ship Security Alert Systems">SSAS</abbr> is part of the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code. It is a system that contributes to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) efforts to strengthen maritime security and suppress acts of terrorism and piracy against shipping.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ship Security Alert Systems">SSAS</abbr> for UK-registered ships should be programmed to send an alert to the competent authority approved by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>, and to Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre Falmouth.</p>

<p>To apply for registration as a competent authority for the receipt of ship security alerts, or to notify <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> of changes in contact details of the competent authority or of the <abbr title="Company Security Officer">CSO</abbr>, the <abbr title="Company Security Officer">CSO</abbr> should complete Marine Safety Form (<abbr title="Marine Safety Form">MSF</abbr>) 5608 and send it the address detailed on the form.</p>

<p>For further information, you can call the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> Security Policy Branch on 023 8032 9478 or email them at <a href="mailto:HQ_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk">HQ_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ships-that-must-comply-with-maritime-security-requirements">Ships that must comply with maritime security requirements</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea">SOLAS</abbr> Chapter XI-2 and the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code apply to the following types of ships engaged on international voyages:</p>

<ul>
<li>passenger ships, including high-speed passenger craft</li>
  <li>cargo ships, including high-speed craft, of 500 gross tonnage and upwards</li>
  <li>mobile offshore drilling units</li>
</ul>
<p>European Commission Regulation 725/2004 extends the scope of compliance to include:</p>

<ul>
<li>domestic ‘Class A’ passenger ships (domestic ships which travel more than 20 miles from a place of refuge)</li>
  <li>domestic ships required to comply by an EU member state’s risk assessment - for the UK this covers ships certified to carry more than 250 passengers and tankers</li>
  <li>port facilities serving any of the types of ships detailed above</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information, you can call the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> Security Policy Branch on 023 8032 9478 or email them at <a href="mailto:HQ_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk">HQ_maritimesecurity@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ec-inspections-for-marine-security">
<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> inspections for marine security</h2>

<p>Under European Commission Regulation 324/2008, the Commission has powers to inspect UK-registered ships while in a port of an EU member state. A ship may be selected by the Commission for inspection when it is berthed in a port that is undergoing a security inspection. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/regulation_324-2010.pdf%20">Download the Commission’s Regulation 324/2008 from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 55KB)</a> </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> or <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> normally notify ships or shipping companies of any inspection. Sometimes notification comes from the maritime administration of the EU member state of the port the ship is located in.</p>

<p>It is a legal requirement to help the Commission conduct these inspections, and they have the same right to inspect all aspects of the ship’s maritime security compliance as UK flag inspectors.</p>

<p>The Merchant Shipping (Ship Inspection and Survey Organisations) Regulations 1996 (contained in Merchant Shipping Notice No. M.1672) contains information on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/m.1672.pdf">Download Merchant Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr>) 1672 (M) The Merchant Shipping (Ship Inspection and Survey Organisations) Regulations 1996 from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 153KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="council-directive-9457ec">Council Directive 94/57/<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Council Directive 94/57/<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> establishes measures to be followed by the EU member states and organisations concerned with the inspection, survey and certification of ships. This complies with the international conventions on safety at sea and prevention of marine pollution.</p>

<h2 id="ship-identification-numbers-and-continuous-synopsis-records">Ship Identification Numbers and Continuous Synopsis Records</h2>

<p><abbr title="Ship Identification Numbers">SINs</abbr> and <abbr title="Continuous Synopsis Records">CSRs</abbr> are special measures to ensure maritime safety contained in the <abbr title="International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea">SOLAS</abbr> Chapter XI-1. They are also closely associated with the application of the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code.</p>

<p><abbr title="International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea">SOLAS</abbr> Chapter XI-1 Regulation 3/4.1 requires that a <abbr title="Ship Identification Number">SIN</abbr> be permanently marked in a visible place on the vessel, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>on the stern</li>
  <li>on either side of the hull, amidships port and starboard, above the deepest assigned load line</li>
  <li>on either side of the superstructure, port and starboard</li>
  <li>on the front of the superstructure</li>
  <li>in the case of passenger ships, on a horizontal surface visible from the air</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identification-for-large-commercial-yachts">Identification for large commercial yachts</h3>

<p>UK-registered large commercial yachts are authorised to display the <abbr title="Ship Identification Number">SIN</abbr> on a ‘horizontal surface visible from the air’, in the same way as passenger ships.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-synopsis-record">Continuous Synopsis Record</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Continuous Synopsis Record">CSR</abbr> is intended to provide an on-board record of the history of the ship. Every ship that <abbr title="International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea">SOLAS</abbr> Chapter I applies to must have an updated <abbr title="Continuous Synopsis Record">CSR</abbr> containing specified information, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>name of the state for which the ship is entitled to fly the flag</li>
  <li>date of ship registration</li>
  <li><abbr title="Ship Identification Number">SIN</abbr></li>

<h2 id="training-for-company-security-officers-and-ship-security-officers">Training for Company Security Officers and Ship Security Officers</h2>

<p>Shipping companies are required to designate a <abbr title="Company Security Officer">CSO</abbr> to co-ordinate the security activities of the company and its ships, and to liaise with port facilities and governments. All ships must have a properly trained <abbr title="Ship Security Officer">SSO</abbr> on board.</p>

<h3 id="cso-training-and-duties">
<abbr title="Company Security Officer">CSO</abbr> training and duties</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code defines the <abbr title="Company Security Officer">CSO</abbr> as the person designated by the company to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Ship Security Assessment is carried out</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr> is developed, submitted for approval and thereafter implemented and maintained</li>
  <li>liaison with port facility security officers and the <abbr title="Ship Security Officer">SSO</abbr> is upheld</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no requirement for these duties to be included in the <abbr title="Ship Security Plan">SSP</abbr>, but evidence of the activities having taken place will be sought during verification visits.</p>

<p>A key requirement of the <abbr title="International Ship and Port Facility">ISPS</abbr> Code is for the people with security responsibilities to be appropriately trained to carry out their duties. The government requires that <abbr title="Company Security Officers">CSOs</abbr> and <abbr title="Ship Security Officers">SSOs</abbr> associated with UK-registered ships undergo approved training, in accordance with Maritime Safety Committee (MSC)/Circular 1154. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/msc-circ-1154.pdf">Download MSC/Circular 1154 from the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website (PDF, 161KB)</a>.</p>

<p>For companies with more than 50 per cent of ships registered in the UK, the training provider must have been approved by the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/workingatsea/mcga-trainingandcert/ds-stc-usefulcontacts/ds-stc-externalorgs-colleges.htm">Find contact details for <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>-approved colleges on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website</a>.</p>
