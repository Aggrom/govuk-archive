<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are various regulations, guidelines and codes of practice that govern the storing and landspreading of farm wastes. They cover a wide variety of products, such as sewage, sludge, slurry, solid manure, silage, waste milk and agricultural fuel oil. Agricultural fuel oil is a major contributor to water pollution on farmland. Any possible leaks and spillage from storage facilities must therefore be addressed quickly.</p>

<p>This guide covers farming in England and explains what you should do when you are:</p>

<ul>
<li>making or storing silage</li>
  <li>storing slurry</li>
  <li>taking delivery of and applying sewage sludge</li>
  <li>applying waste milk</li>
  <li>storing and spreading solid manure</li>
  <li>managing and storing agricultural fuel oil</li>
</ul>
<p>It also shows how cross compliance impacts on how you manage these waste products.</p>

<h2 id="sewage-sludge-treatment">Sewage sludge treatment</h2>

<p>Sewage sludge is a by-product of the waste-water treatment process that you can use on your farm. Treated sewage sludge - also known as ‘biosolids’ - has several valuable properties. It:</p>

<ul>
<li>is a readily available alternative soil-building material</li>
  <li>contains nutrients and valuable trace elements essential to animals and plants</li>
  <li>is a more efficient and sustainable alternative to inorganic fertilisers and mineral fertilisers - such as phosphate</li>
  <li>provides a source of slow release nitrogen ideal for use in land restoration</li>
  <li>is a good substitute for peat in land reclamation projects, thus conserving valuable natural peatland</li>
</ul>
<p>However, sewage sludge may contain heavy metals which can be harmful to humans and animals unless it is applied correctly. If you supply or spread sludge on agricultural land, you must meet the requirements of the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations.</p>

<p>The key requirements of the regulations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>sewage sludge must have been tested according to the sludge regulations</li>
  <li>you must have tested the soil and checked that the concentration of metals in the soil will not exceed the limit</li>
  <li>you must not spread sludge on a soil with a pH below five</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/soil-management-standards-for-farmers">soil use</a>.</p>

<p>You must not use sewage sludge and septic tank sludge:</p>

<ul>
<li>when fruit - other than fruit trees - or vegetables are growing or are to be harvested in the soil at the time of use</li>
  <li>without considering plants’ nutrient needs</li>
  <li>if it will damage soil, surface water or groundwater quality</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of sewage sludge on farms is covered by Statutory Management Requirement (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr>) 3 under cross compliance. You can read more about sewage sludge and cross compliance on the page in this guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-sewage-sludge-slurry-and-silage">how cross compliance affects sewage sludge use</a>. For more information, see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">cross compliance: the basics</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-management-requirements"><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If sewage sludge gets into a watercourse, you should call the Environment Agency - Water Pollution Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 immediately. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/water-pollution-on-farms">water pollution on farms</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-bring-sludge-onto-your-farm">How to bring sludge onto your farm</h3>

<p>When sewage sludge passes from one person to another, the Environmental Protection (Duty of Care) Regulations apply.</p>

<p>If you have used a different sewage sludge producer in the past, you must give your current producer details of where, when and how much sludge you used and who supplied it.</p>

<p>You cannot transport sewage sludge unless you are registered as a waste carrier, and you must complete duty of care waste transfer notes.</p>

<p>To find out how to reduce how much waste your farm produces, see the guide on minimising farm waste, composting and recycling.</p>

<h2 id="how-cross-compliance-affects-sewage-sludge-use">How cross compliance affects sewage sludge use</h2>

<p>The use of sewage sludge on farms is covered by <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 3 under cross compliance. <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 3 aims to ensure that if you use sewage sludge on your land, there is no risk to human, animal or plant health and there are no harmful effects on soil. It also tells you what you should and should not do when using sewage sludge.</p>

<p>Farmers registered with the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) are restricted in how much sludge they can spread and when they should apply it. For example, you must not spread slurry on waterlogged soil, or within two metres of the centre of a hedgerow or watercourse.</p>

<p>For more information, read theguides on cross compliance: the basics, SMRs and the SPS.</p>

<p>You can also order the Cross Compliance Handbook for England by calling the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) Publications Orderline on 08459 556 000, or the Cross Compliance Helpline on 0845 345 1302.</p>

<h2 id="storage-and-spread-of-slurries-and-solid-manure">Storage and spread of slurries and solid manure</h2>

<p>There is guidance for farmers in England who spread or store livestock slurry or solid manure from agriculture.</p>

<h3 id="spread-of-slurry-and-solid-manure">Spread of slurry and solid manure</h3>

<p>You should always spread manure, dirty water and slurry in line with statutory requirements and voluntary codes of good agricultural practice (<abbr title="Codes of Good Agricultural Practice">CoGAP</abbr>). This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>drawing up a nutrient management plan</li>
  <li>drawing up a manure management plan for solid manure - see the page introduction to management plans for manure, nutrients, soil and crop protection in the guide on air, water and soil pollution: the basics.</li>
  <li>supervising the work of contractors spreading your slurry</li>
  <li>monitoring the content of metals in pig and poultry manures and in the soil</li>
</ul>
<p>You should not spread or store slurry or solid manure:</p>

<ul>
<li>within 10 metres of a watercourse - including field drains or ditches</li>
  <li>within 50 metres of a source of drinking water for human consumption or of water for farm dairies</li>
  <li>on steeply sloping fields where there is a risk of run-off</li>
  <li>on waterlogged or compacted land</li>
  <li>when fields are frozen or snow-covered</li>
  <li>when the soil is cracked down to field drains, or has been pipe- or mole-drained within the last 12 months</li>
</ul>
<p>If you let livestock slurry or manure enter rivers, streams or other watercourses, you may be committing a pollution offence.</p>

<p>For more information, <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=252412&amp;id=252413">download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s water, soil and air protection guidance from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 1.37MB)</a>.</p>

<p>Special rules apply if your farm is in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (<abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>). For more information, see the guide on NVZs.</p>

<p>For information on storing and spreading manure and slurry on or near land which produces ready-to-eat crops, see the section within this guide on managing manures for food safety.</p>

<p>For information on storing and spreading organic manure, see the page on organic manures in the guide on fertiliser recommendations for crops.</p>

<h3 id="storage-of-slurry">Storage of slurry</h3>

<p>If you are storing slurry, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>inform your environmental regulator in writing at least 14 days in advance if you plan to install a new silo or alter an existing one</li>
  <li>make sure any new or substantially reconstructed or enlarged stores last for at least 20 years with proper maintenance</li>
  <li>make sure the slurry storage tank accommodates at least four months’ production, including rainwater, otherwise, you must prepare a manure management plan as this will help you decide when and where to spread your organic manures - you can see the page introduction to management plans for manure, nutrients, soil and crop protection in the guide on air, water and soil quality: the basics or <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=11169&amp;id=15584">download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s draft Manure Management Plan from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 92KB)</a>
</li>
  <li>install two valves in series on any drainage pipe and lock them shut when not in use</li>
  <li>follow the Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) Regulations 1991 if your storage facilities were constructed or substantially altered after 1 September 1991, as older storage facilities are normally exempt - however, your environmental regulator can stop you using the storage until you’ve carried out improvement work</li>
  <li>find out whether you are within an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> - if you are, you will need to follow certain rules, such as limiting use of organic and inorganic nitrogen fertiliser and keeping records - <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> are designated areas of land which drain to waters polluted by nitrates from agricultural land</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>, see the guide on NVZs.</p>

<h3 id="slurry-and-ammonia">Slurry and ammonia</h3>

<p>Slurry is likely to release ammonia when it comes into contact with air. Ammonia can damage and disrupt vegetation, soil and foliage. The UK is required to reduce ammonia emissions to meet air quality standards.</p>

<p>You can reduce ammonia emissions by using different:</p>

<ul>
<li>storage methods for manure</li>
  <li>handling and spreading methods for slurry</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out more about how you can reduce ammonia emissions, <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=252412&amp;id=252413">download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s water, soil and air protection guidance from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 1.37MB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="management-of-manures-for-food-safety">Management of manures for food safety</h2>

<p>Manures may contain micro-organisms which cause food-borne illnesses - such as E. coli O157, salmonella, listeria, campylobacter, cryptosporidium and giardia. To avoid contamination of food crops by manure - particularly for ready-to-eat crops - you must manage your application, timing and storage of manures. You should create a safety plan and keep farm records of using manure on your farm.</p>

<p>Always spread manure on farmland in line with statutory requirements and voluntary <abbr title="Codes of Good Agricultural Practice">CoGAP</abbr>. For more information, see the guide on managing nutrients and fertilisers.</p>

<h3 id="ready-to-eat-crops">Ready-to-eat crops</h3>

<p>Ready-to-eat crops include fruit and salads, but also vegetables that may be eaten raw or juiced. These are particularly susceptible to microbial contamination, so you should avoid planting them on land which:</p>

<ul>
<li>has been spread with fresh manure or slurry, or used for livestock grazing, within the previous six months, or within 12 months of harvesting time</li>
  <li>is next to livestock buildings</li>
  <li>risks surface run-off from yards or manure storage areas</li>
</ul>
<p>You should keep track of when you have spread fresh manure or grazed livestock on land where you intend to grow ready-to-eat crops. Your records should identify the manure’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>type</li>
  <li>rate</li>
  <li>date of application</li>
  <li>source and management of the manure before spreading</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also keep records of your livestock grazing. These should detail the:</p>

<ul>
<li>livestock type</li>
  <li>stocking rate</li>

<h3 id="how-to-use-stored-and-treated-manure-and-slurries">How to use stored and treated manure and slurries</h3>

<p>If you intend to use manure on your land, you should ensure that you store and treat it in a way that will kill off any pathogenic micro-organisms. During storage, pathogenic micro-organisms in manures can be killed by:</p>

<ul>
<li>temperatures above 55°C</li>
  <li>freezing</li>
  <li>sunlight</li>
  <li>acid or alkaline conditions</li>
  <li>time - in some conditions they can survive for several months</li>
  <li>drying out</li>
</ul>
<p>The safest ways of storing and treating manure include:</p>

<ul>
<li>batch storage of solid manures and slurries for at least six months</li>
  <li>composting solid manures for at least three months, using active management to generate temperatures above 55°C for three days</li>
  <li>lime treatment of slurry to raise the pH to 12 for at least two hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Manure and slurries that have been stored or treated in these ways are safe to apply to land where you are going to plant ready-to-eat crops.</p>

<h3 id="prevention-of-contamination-of-growing-crops-and-how-to-reduce-risks-during-and-after-harvest">Prevention of contamination of growing crops and how to reduce risks during and after harvest</h3>

<p>There are several ways to avoid contamination in your crops from manure while they are growing, and during and after harvest.</p>

<p>To avoid contamination of growing crops, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>not apply any manure or slurries to crops once they have been drilled or planted</li>
  <li>not spread manure on nearby fields if there’s a likelihood of run-off or contamination through slurry spray</li>
  <li>use clean equipment in fields where you’re growing ready-to-eat crops</li>
  <li>make sure irrigation water hasn’t been contaminated by run-off from manure storage areas, manure spreading or grazing livestock</li>
  <li>keep livestock and pets away from ready-to-eat crops</li>
</ul>
<p>You can reduce contamination risks from manure during and after harvest by ensuring that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the harvesting machinery and equipment are clean and haven’t been driven through manure on the way to the field</li>
  <li>containers and packaging are clean and sanitised before use, and packing crates are not contaminated by soil if crops are packed in the field</li>
  <li>you keep all birds and animals out of packing sheds and storage areas</li>
  <li>you don’t use fresh fruit for human consumption if it’s fallen off trees onto ground which has been grazed by livestock within the last 12 months</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="silage-effluent">Silage effluent</h2>

<p>Silage effluent is one of the strongest effluents produced on the farm. As a farmer, you need to comply with several legal requirements and <abbr title="Codes of Good Agricultural Practice">CoGAP</abbr> in order to safeguard the farm and the environment.</p>

<p>Those legal requirements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>informing the Environment Agency in writing at least 14 days in advance if you plan to install a new silo or alter an existing one - although facilities built before March 1991 are exempt, you should still meet the regulation standards</li>
  <li>ensuring silos and baled, bagged or wrapped silage are more than ten metres away from a watercourse</li>
  <li>having a tank to contain effluent - the tank must have capacity of 20 litres per cubic metre of silo capacity (up to 1,500 cubic metres), and then an additional 6.7 litres per cubic metre thereafter</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-silage-effluent-as-a-soil-fertiliser">How to use silage effluent as a soil fertiliser</h3>

<p>You should dilute silage effluent with the same amount of water, then apply it to land at no more than 50 cubic metres per hectare (4,500 gallons per acre).</p>

<p>For full guidance on the requirements for using silage, <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=252412&amp;id=252413">download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s water, soil and air - protection guidance from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 1.38MB)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="waste-milk">Waste milk</h2>

<p>You must discard any milk that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>surplus</li>
  <li>visibly abnormal</li>
  <li>from the first milking after antibiotic treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be able to spread waste milk on land if it is carried out as a benefit to agriculture.</p>

<p>You will need to register an exemption from environmental permitting (U10 exemption) if you spread milk on land. It is free to register an exemption with the Environment Agency. If you cannot meet the conditions of this exemption, you must get a standard environmental permit (standard permit SR2010 No.4) before spreading milk on land.</p>

<p>New environmental permitting regulations came into force across England and Wales on 6 April 2010. If you registered an exemption before 6 April 2010, you must re-register in the new system by 1 October 2013.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/117085.aspx">Find out about the conditions for the U10 exemption on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/116406.aspx">register an exemption on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/117161.aspx">read about the standard permit for landspreading on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also get information and guidance by calling the Environment Agency Helpline on 03708 506 506.</p>

<h2 id="fuel-oil-storage">Fuel oil storage</h2>

<p>If you operate a farm in England or Wales that stores more than 1,500 litres of fuel oil for agricultural purposes, and which has storage facilities that were constructed or substantially altered after 1991, you must abide by the Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) Regulations 1991.</p>

<p>The regulations include the following provisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>containers should be sited more than ten metres from the nearest watercourse</li>
  <li>oil tanks, drums and intermediate bulk containers and their associated equipment should be within a bund or secondary containment system</li>
  <li>valves and taps should be kept locked when the tank is not in use</li>
  <li>flexible pipes should be fitted with an automatic closure valve and locked within the bund when not in use</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-the-regulations-are-enforced">How the regulations are enforced</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency enforces the regulations in England and Wales.</p>

<p>Before you use new or substantially reconstructed or enlarged fuel storage areas, you must notify the enforcing authority at least 14 days in advance.</p>

<p>Normally, older storage facilities are exempt from the regulations. However, even if your fuel oil storage facilities are exempt, the enforcing authority may consider that they could cause pollution and you may therefore need to carry out improvements to the storage equipment.</p>

<p>If you do not comply with the regulations, you are committing a criminal offence and could be prosecuted or fined up to £5,000.</p>

<p>Advice on storing oil is contained in the <abbr title="Codes of Good Agricultural Practice">CoGAP</abbr> published by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=252412&amp;id=252413">Download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on protecting water, soil and air from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 1.38MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="waste-fuel-oil-how-to-recycle">Waste fuel oil: how to recycle</h3>

<p>You can burn waste oils for heating, providing you obtain approval for the installation from the local authority Environmental Health Department. You should also check with the Environment Agency (EA) whether you need to register an exemption from environmental permitting requirements.</p>

<p>You may find opportunities to recycle your waste fuel oil. You can find details of your nearest waste recycling centre by entering your postcode into the online Waste Recycling Directory. <a rel="external" href="http://www.wasterecycling.org.uk">Find your nearest registered waste site on the Waste Directory website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spills-how-to-deal-with-them">Spills: how to deal with them</h3>

<p>You will also need to have an incident response plan to refer to in the event of a spill. You must ensure that staff are fully trained and know what to do when an incident arises. You can <a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0309BPNA-e-e.pdf">download a sample incident response plan in Pollution Prevention Guideline (<abbr title="Pollution Prevention Guideline">PPG</abbr>) 21 from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 319KB)</a>.</p>

<p>As part of your incident response plan, you should ensure that appropriate materials are always close to your oil store. These can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>earth</li>
  <li>sand or other commercial absorbent</li>
  <li>an oil spill kit</li>
  <li>gully seals</li>
  <li>booms</li>
</ul>
<p>If a spill does occur, you can use these to manage the outflow of oil. For example, the earth can contain the spread of the oil and the sand can be used to soak it up. Do not hose oil down or use detergents to try to disperse it.</p>

<p>You must dispose of any materials contaminated with oil as hazardous waste. For further information see the guide on managing your hazardous waste.</p>

<p>You should act immediately in the event of a spillage to prevent oil reaching drains or watercourses. You can call the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on 0800 80 70 60 to report an incident.</p>

<h2 id="farm-waste-learning-tool">Farm waste learning tool</h2>

<p>NetRegs has developed an online learning tool that will help you understand how to manage your farm waste. There are seven subjects:</p>
