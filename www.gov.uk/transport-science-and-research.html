<h2 id="international-transport-research">International transport research</h2>

<p>Much of the department’s research has an international dimension, either because the policy context is international or because the research objectives are also of interest to other countries and international research organisations. </p>

<p>The department has a direct interest in a number of international research programmes and initiatives including the European Union framework programmes, European Co-operation in Science and Technology (<abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr>) and research activities of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr>).</p>

<p>The Chief Scientific Adviser’s unit co-ordinates and (where appropriate) manages the department’s interests in the EU, <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> and <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> research programmes. It seeks to ensure that <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and UK policy objectives are met in the strategic formulation, coverage and content of these programmes.</p>

<p>The following pages provide an overview of EU, <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> and <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> research, together with details on how to access further information, in particular the EU’s framework programme of research.</p>

<h3 id="european-research-area">European research area</h3>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html">European Research Area (ERA)</a> was initiated in 2000 and all new EU research framework programmes (FPs) form the key pillars of this strategy.</p>

<p>ERA objectives include:</p>

<ul>
<li>networking of existing centres of excellence in Europe and the creation of virtual centres through the use of new interactive communication tools.</li>
  <li>a common approach to the needs and means of financing large research facilities in Europe.</li>
  <li>more coherent implementation of national and European research activities and closer relations between the various organisations of scientific and technological co-operation in Europe.</li>
  <li>establishment of a common system of scientific and technical reference for the implementation of policies.</li>
  <li>greater European cohesion in research based on the best experiences of knowledge transfer at regional and local levels and on the role of the regions in the European research efforts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="framework-programmes-of-research-and-technological-development-fps">Framework programmes of research and technological development (FPs)</h3>

<p>The framework programmes are European Community funded, multi-annual research and technological development programmes (started in 1984), to improve the competitiveness of European industry and provide support for the development of common policies. The programmes provide a framework and financial support for collaborative research in areas defined as being high priority at the European level.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> encourages the use of EU funded research in the policy making decisions of the department, and has participated in projects under the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th framework programmes.</p>

<h3 id="seventh-framework-programme-2007-to-2013-fp7">Seventh framework programme 2007 to 2013 (FP7)</h3>

<p>FP7 is the short name for the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fp7uk.dti.gov.uk/Site/overview/default.cfm">7th framework programme for research and technological development</a>. This is the EU’s main instrument for funding research in Europe and it will run from 2007 to 2013.</p>

<p>The EC budget for the next 7 years is € 50.5 billion. FP7 supports research in selected priority areas – the aim being to make, or keep, the EU as a world leader in those sectors, and is also designed to respond to Europe’s employment needs and competitiveness.</p>

<p>FP7 is made up of blocks of activities forming 5 specific programmes. The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> has involvement principally with:</p>

<ul>
<li>information and communication technologies</li>
  <li>environment (including climate change)</li>
  <li>transport (including aeronautics)</li>
  <li>security</li>
  <li>space</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge lies at the heart of the European Union’s Lisbon strategy to become the “most dynamic competitive knowledge-based economy in the world”. The ‘knowledge triangle’ – research, education and innovation – is a core factor in European efforts to meet the ambitious Lisbon goals. Numerous programmes, initiatives and support measures are carried out at EU level in support of knowledge.</p>

<p>The 7th framework programme (FP7) links all research-related EU initiatives together under a common roof playing a crucial role in reaching the goals of growth, competitiveness and employment; along with a new competitiveness and innovation framework programme (<abbr title="Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme">CIP</abbr>), education and training programmes, and structural and cohesion funds for regional convergence and competitiveness. It is also a key pillar for the European research area (ERA).</p>

<h3 id="sixth-framework-programme-2002-to-2006-fp6">Sixth framework programme 2002 to 2006 (FP6)</h3>

<p>The proposal for the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm">6th framework programme</a> was more ambitious than the previous programmes, with the aim of mobilising the critical mass of European research and expertise to an extent not previously done. The 6th framework programme is therefore seen as one of the major instruments in the development of a European research area.</p>

<h3 id="fifth-framework-programme-1998-to-2002-fp5">Fifth framework programme 1998 to 2002 (FP5)</h3>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp5.html">5th framework programme</a> was launched in spring 1999 and has now closed to new proposals. However a number of results will not be available for 2 to 3 years as many research projects still have some time to run.</p>

<h3 id="cordis">CORDIS</h3>

<p>The European Union’s RTD electronic database – CORDIS – provides information on all EU supported research and technology programmes.</p>

<p>The European Union also produces a brochure, <a rel="external" href="http://cordis.europa.eu/news/focus/home_en.html">CORDIS Focus</a> which summarises the latest news on European Union research programmes.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> actions consist of basic and pre-competitive research as well as activities of public utility.</p>

<p>There are 35 <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> member countries.</p>

<p>Four basic principles underlie <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
<li>all cost member countries, as well as the European Commission, can propose <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> actions</li>
  <li>participation in these actions is voluntary, associating only interested countries</li>
  <li>the research to be co-ordinated is funded nationally - the co-ordination costs are funded both by the participating countries and by the European Commission</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> action aims to co-ordinate national research at a European level (concerted action) - the work undertaken by each action is administered by a management committee</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to community research programmes, this form of collaboration does not require an agreed overall research policy. It focuses on specific themes for which there is particular interest in the <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>There are 18 areas of <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> Actions, the most relevant to this department being the transport areas.</p>

<h4 id="cost-eligibility">
<abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> eligibility</h4>

<p>All member countries and international organisations can propose actions through national representatives. Approval of actions is through the <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> transport technical committee comprising representatives of member states. Proposals for transport actions should be submitted by June each year.</p>

<p>The decision making body for <abbr title="European Co-operation in Science and Technology">COST</abbr> is the committee of senior officials which meets 3 to 4 times a year. Actions recommended by the technical committees are authorised by the CSO. The UK is represented on the CSO by the Office of Science and Innovation.</p>

<h4 id="the-organisation-for-economic-co-operation-and-development-oecd-road-and-intermodal-transport-research-programme-rtr">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr>): road and intermodal transport research programme (RTR)</h4>

<p><abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> provides a co-operative framework for co-ordinating national research in road transport and intermodal linkages (where other modes interface with roads), primarily through concerted actions and seminars. A triennial programme is adopted by member states participating in the programme which is adjusted biennially. Participation is voluntary, associating only interested states. Actions are funded through:</p>

<ul>
<li>subscription by member states</li>
  <li>pilot country activities (sponsored by a member state)</li>
  <li>voluntary dedicated budget (for undertaking a programme of new research)</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme has also established 2 self-financing international databases:</p>

<ol>
<li>International Transport Research Documentation (ITRD)</li>
  <li>International Road Traffic and Accident Database (IRTAD)</li>
</ol>
<p>Research areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>sustainable transport development</li>
  <li>multimodal transport strategies</li>
  <li>economic performance, transport infrastructure and management</li>
</ul>
<p>The mandate for the RTR programme is due to be renewed in 2003 to cover a further 3 years (2004 to 2006). Work on identifying the topics to be investigated has started.</p>

<h4 id="oecd-online-database">
<abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> online database</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> has an <a rel="external" href="http://www.oecd.org/findDocument/0,3770,en_2649_34337_1_1_1_1_1,00.html">online database</a> which provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>general information on the transport and environment related research programmes</li>
  <li>information on research projects</li>
  <li>recent publications</li>
  <li>access to two databases: the International Transport Research Documentation (ITRD) and the International Road Traffic and Accident Database (IRTAD)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="international-transport-forum-itf">International Transport Forum (ITF)</h4>

<p>The International Transport Forum (ITF) at the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> is an intergovernmental organisation with 52 member countries. It acts as a strategic think tank for transport policy and organises an annual summit of ministers.</p>

<p>The ITF’s goal is to help shape the transport policy agenda on a global level, and ensure that it contributes to economic growth, environmental protection, social inclusion and the preservation of human life and well-being.</p>

<p>The International Transport Forum evolved from the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) in 2006 to 2007. At the time, ministers decided to invite new members from non-European countries in order to address transport issues on a global level and for all transport modes, and to create a public platform for a broad policy dialogue.</p>

<p>In the post-war years, the challenge was to rebuild Europe’s battered transport infrastructure, and the ECMT provided a welcome mechanism for coordination. As prosperity grew in Europe, increased trade flows and exploding tourism shifted the emphasis to expanding transport infrastructure to meet the new demands. With European integration progressing and globalisation posing challenges of a new magnitude for the transport sector, ministers at their <a rel="external" href="http://www.internationaltransportforum.org/about/about.html">meeting in Dublin, Ireland, in May 2006</a> created the International Transport Forum by adopting the <a rel="external" href="http://www.internationaltransportforum.org/about/about.html">Dublin Declaration</a>.</p>

<p>Further information is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.internationaltransportforum.org/">ITF website</a>.</p>

<h4 id="transport-research-knowledge-centre-trkc">Transport Research Knowledge centre (<abbr title="Transport Research Knowledge centre">TRKC</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.transport-research.info/web/index.cfm">Transport Research Knowledge centre (<abbr title="Transport Research Knowledge centre">TRKC</abbr>)</a> project attempts to collect, structure, analyse and disseminate transport research results, covering not only European Union (EU) supported but also nationally financed research in the European research area (ERA), as well selected global transport research and technological development (RTD) programmes and projects.</p>

<h2 id="research-database">Research database</h2>

<p>Introduced at the end of 2003, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/rmd">research database</a> is intended to contain details of research projects funded by the department and completed after 1 April 2001.</p>

<h2 id="social-research-and-evaluation">Social research and evaluation</h2>

<p>The social research evaluation team is cross-cutting and covers a wide range of <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> policy areas. The team works with <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> economists, statisticians, operational researchers and scientists.</p>

<p>The teams role includes commissioning, managing and conducting high quality social research and policy evaluation, and advising staff across <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Social research generates data and analysis using the methods of social science such as social surveys, focus groups, in-depth interviews, case studies and innovative methods such as deliberative research. In addition to these methods, policy evaluation also involves cost-benefit analyses, and measures the delivery of policies and initiatives against objectives. This enables <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> to better understand policy impacts and outcomes, and lessons learned can then be applied to improve <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> policies and services in the future.</p>

<p>Information about our research programme, including planned research is available from the <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100413203302/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/otherresearch/evidenceactivity0809">strategy, economics and mobility unit evidence and research strategy</a>.</p>

<p>All of SRE’s work is carried out in adherence to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/gsr-code">GSR code</a>. SRE has also implemented measures to ensure compliance with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/publications">GSR publications protocol</a> introduced in April 2010. This protocol is intended to ensure transparency and openness of government social research, in part by requiring all final research outputs to be published within 12 weeks of the approval of a final draft report. A full list of SRE research within the scope of the publications protocol ongoing or newly commissioned since this date is presented – see <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/grs-publications-protocol-publication-table">GSR publications protocol – publication table</a>.</p>
