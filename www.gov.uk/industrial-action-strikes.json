This is called a 'lock-out'.\r\n\r\n##Calling industrial action##\r\nIndustrial action happens when trade union members are in a dispute with their employers that can't be solved through negotiations. \r\n\r\nA trade union can only call for industrial action if a majority of its members involved support it in a [properly organised postal vote](holding-a-ballot \"holding a ballot\") - called a 'ballot'. \r\n\r\nBefore organising a ballot, a union must decide which members affected by a dispute it wants to ask to take industrial action. It must tell all members entitled to vote and the employer what the ballot results were. \r\n\r\nA trade union calls industrial action by telling members and the employer when and how this action will be taken. This should be done by a trade union official or committee that has the legal right to do so. Your voting paper must have said who this is.\r\n\r\n##Taking part in industrial action - your rights##\r\nIf you're a trade union member, you have the right to vote before your union asks you to take industrial action. You don't have to take part in industrial action and can't be disciplined by your union if you don't.\r\n\r\nIf you do get excluded or expelled from your union, you can complain to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals \"employment tribunals\").","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Your union must have a vote (a 'ballot') that's properly organised according to legal rules. \r\n\r\n##Properly organised ballots##\r\nA ballot for industrial action must:\r\n\r\n+ be supervised by a qualified independent person (a 'scrutineer' - often someone from an organisation like the Electoral Reform Society) appointed by the union if over 50 members are being balloted\r\n+ be held before the union asks members to take or continue taking action\r\n+ be open to all members the union wants to take action\r\n+ be a postal ballot where members vote by marking a box on a voting paper and return it in a prepaid envelope \r\n+ include information on what the ballot is about and where to post your vote\r\n\r\nThe union must tell everyone entitled to vote how many people voted, the number of yes votes, no votes or spoiled papers as soon as it can after the ballot. \r\n\r\nIt must also give the employer one week's notice of the start of the ballot and tell them the result as soon as\u00a0possible once it's available.\r\n\r\nThere are other rules in 'The Code of Practice on industrial action ballots'.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n[Download 'The Code of Practice on industrial action ballots' (PDF, 193KB)](http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/I/05-1462-industrial-action-ballots-notice-to-employers.pdf \"Download 'The Code of Practice on industrial action ballots'  (PDF, 193KB)\"){:rel=\"external\"} \r\n$D\r\n\r\n##Questions on the voting paper##\r\nWhen you're balloted, your voting paper must ask whether you want to take part in either (or both):\r\n\r\n+ strike action\r\n+ action short of a strike\r\n\r\nThe union can only call on members to take action if a majority of members who voted were in favour of that particular action.

You can take legal advice before doing this.\r\n\r\nThe court may order the union not to organise action if it decides a ballot wasn't held according to the rules.\r\n\r\nYou can apply for a temporary injunction that tells the union not to call industrial action if your case can't be heard in court straight away.\r\n\r\nIf the union doesn't do what the court says, you can ask them to 'declare the union to be in contempt of court' and the union can be fined. \r\n","slug":"holding-a-ballot","title":"Holding a ballot "}},{"table":{"body":"You have the right to take industrial action and you can't be legally forced to stay at, or go back to, work (unless a ballot wasn't organised properly).\r\n\r\nIf you take industrial action, you'll probably have broken (be 'in breach of') your employment contract and your employer:\r\n\r\n+ is unlikely to pay for the work you didn't do when you took industrial action \r\n+ can sue you for breaking your contract (this doesn't happen often)\r\n\r\nTaking industrial action doesn't usually mean that your employer will say you've broken your period of continuous employment with them.

Usually flying pickets are illegal - you can only join a picket line at your workplace. \r\n\r\nTrade union reps can be on picket lines at different workplaces if they're responsible for organising workers in those workplaces. \r\n ","slug":"going-on-strike-and-picketing","title":"Going on strike and picketing"}}],"type":"guide"}
