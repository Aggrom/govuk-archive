When dismissing staff, you must do it fairly.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of dismissal:\r\n\r\n- fair dismissal\r\n- unfair dismissal\r\n- constructive dismissal\r\n- wrongful dismissal\r\n\r\n##Fair and unfair dismissal\r\n\r\nA dismissal is [fair](/fair-dismissals \"fair dismissals\") or [unfair](/unfair-dismissals \"unfair dismissals\") depending on:\r\n\r\n- your reason for it\r\n- how you act during the dismissal process\r\n\r\n##Constructive dismissal\r\n\r\nThis is when an employee resigns because you've breached their employment contract. This could be a single serious event or a series of less serious events.\r\n\r\nAn employee could claim constructive dismissal if you: \r\n\r\n- cut their wages without agreement\r\n- unlawfully demote them\r\n- allow them to be harassed, bullied or discriminated against\r\n- unfairly increase their workload\r\n- change the location of their workplace at short notice\r\n- make them work in dangerous conditions\r\n\r\n^A constructive dismissal isn't necessarily unfair - but it would be difficult for you to show that a breach of contract was fair.^\r\n\r\n##Wrongful dismissal\r\n\r\nThis is where you break the terms of an employee's contract in the dismissal process, eg dismissing someone without giving them proper notice.\r\n\r\nWrongful dismissal isn't the same as [unfair dismissal](/unfair-dismissals \"unfair dismissals\").\r\n\r\nIf an employee thinks you've dismissed them unfairly, constructively or wrongfully, they might take you to an [employment tribunal](/being-taken-to-an-employment-tribunal-by-an-employee/overview \"employment tribunals\").\r\n\r\n^In Northern Ireland, an employee would take you to an industrial tribunal.\"","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"You must have a fair reason for dismissing an employee.

If it doesn't, you should suspend the employee on full pay and investigate the circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf you feel summary dismissal's your only choice, you must still follow a fair procedure as you would do for any other disciplinary matter.\r\n\r\n^In Northern Ireland, an employer must follow the statutory dismissal procedure.^\r\n\r\n*[Acas]:Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service","slug":"fair-dismissals","title":"Fair dismissals"}},{"table":{"body":"Even if you think you've dismissed someone fairly, they could still claim unfair dismissal against you if they think that:\r\n\r\n- the reason you gave for the dismissal wasn't the real one\r\n- the reason was unfair \r\n- you acted unreasonably, eg by failing to give them plenty of warning about their dismissal\r\n\r\n##Automatically unfair reasons for dismissal\r\n\r\nEven if you've acted reasonably, some reasons for dismissal are classed automatically unfair.
