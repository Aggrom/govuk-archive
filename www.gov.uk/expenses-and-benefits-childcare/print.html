  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing childcare to your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Employer supported childcare is normally provided through <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/payroll/special-pay/salary-sacrifice.htm" title="salary sacrifice" rel="external">salary sacrifice.</a> This means an employee gives up part of their salary in return for a non-cash benefit.</p>
</div>

<h2>What’s covered</h2>

<p>What you have to pay and report depends on whether:</p>

<ul>
<li>you provide a workplace childcare facility yourself</li>
  <li>your employees pay for childcare themselves and you pay them back</li>
  <li>you contract directly with a childcare provider, such as a commercial nursery or a childminder</li>
  <li>you give your employees childcare vouchers</li>
  <li>your employees applied to join your employer supported childcare scheme on or after 6 April 2011</li>
</ul>
<p>It also depends on whether the employee is a director, and how much they earn.</p>

</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You might not have to report anything to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) or pay tax and National Insurance.</p>

<h2>Workplace nurseries</h2>

<p>If you provide places for employees’ children in a workplace nursery, you don’t have to report or pay anything. To be exempt, a workplace nursery must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have the appropriate <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM22003.htm" title="registrations and approvals">registrations and approvals</a>
</li>
  <li>be available to all your employees</li>
  <li>provide childcare for your employees’ children, or children they have parental responsibility for</li>
  <li>provide childcare up to the end of the week of 1 September following each child’s 15th birthday, or 16th birthday for children with a disability</li>
</ul>
<p>The facility doesn’t have to be at your workplace. It can be in other premises that you manage and finance, as long as they’re not a private residence.</p>

<h2>Commercial childcare or vouchers</h2>

<p>You can provide a fixed amount of employee supported childcare to all employees without having to pay or report anything.</p>

<p>To be exempt, the childcare you provide (or provide vouchers for) needs to meet the criteria for workplace nurseries.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Certain low-paid employees may be excluded from the requirement for childcare to be available to all employees. See <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-childcare/technical-guidance" title="technical guidance">technical guidance</a> on childcare voucher exemption.</p>
</div>

<h3>Limits for exemption</h3>

<p>For any employees who applied to join a childcare scheme you run before 6 April 2011, the limit is £55 a week, or £243 a month.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are different rules for employees who joined employer-supported childcare schemes on or after 6 April 2011.</p>
</div>

<p>The main difference is that the limit for these employees depends on the rate of income tax they pay. The limits are shown in the following table:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Rate of income tax</th>
      <th>Weekly exempt limit</th>
      <th>Monthly exempt limit</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Basic (20%)</td>
      <td>£55</td>
      <td>£243</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Higher (40%)</td>
      <td>£28</td>
      <td>£124</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Additional (50%)</td>
      <td>£22</td>
      <td>£97</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You’ll need to carry out a ‘basic earnings assessment’ to work out the correct rate, and keep certain records. See <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s guide to employer supported childcare for full details.</p>

<h3>Commercial childcare for employees earning at a rate of less than £8,500 per year</h3>

<p>You don’t have to report or pay anything for these employees if you contract directly with a childcare provider, regardless of the cost of the childcare.</p>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If any of the childcare you provide isn’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-childcare/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to report the costs to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>), and you may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on the cost to you.</p>

<h2>Commercial childcare</h2>

<p>If you provide commercial childcare above the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-childcare/whats-exempt" title="exempt limit">exempt limit</a> to employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more per year, or directors, you need to: </p>

<ul>
<li>fill in the amount above the limit on form P11D, section M</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the amount above the limit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Childcare vouchers</h2>

<p>If you provide childcare vouchers to employees above the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-childcare/whats-exempt" title="exempt limit">exempt limit</a>, the following table shows what you’ll need to report and pay.</p>

<h2>Childcare your employees pay for and you pay them back</h2>

<p>If you cover the costs of employees’ childcare in any of the following ways, this counts as earnings:</p>

<ul>
<li>paying them back for their childcare bills</li>
  <li>providing a cash allowance to cover childcare costs</li>
  <li>providing additional salary to meet the cost of childcare</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the amount you pay the employee to their other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and Class 1 National Insurance through payroll</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><p>The amount you need to report depends on the kind of vouchers, and how you provide them.</p>

<h2>Commercial childcare or vouchers</h2>

<p>The value to use is the cost of the childcare <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-childcare/whats-exempt" title="above the exempt limit">above the exempt limit</a>.</p>

<h2>Childcare your employees pay for and you pay them back</h2>

<p>Use the amount that you pay the employee back for childcare costs.</p>
