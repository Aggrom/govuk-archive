<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The welfare of animals at the time of slaughter or killing is covered by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive 93/119 and UK regulations. These rules state that it is an offence to cause or permit an animal to suffer avoidable excitement, pain or suffering. Animals must be handled, stunned and killed using specific methods by licensed slaughtermen.</p>

<p>This guide covers the welfare of farm animals at slaughter or killing. It explains the legal requirements that protect animals at slaughter or killing and how these rules are enforced.</p>

<p>It alsoÂ explains how to applyÂ for a provisional or registered slaughtermanâs licence - and outlines the training, skills and knowledge you will need.</p>

<p>From January 2013, Directive 93/119 will be replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No.1099/2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing.</p>

<h2 id="legal-requirements-for-animal-welfare-at-killing-and-slaughter">Legal requirements for animal welfare at killing and slaughter</h2>

<p>There are legal requirements that you must follow regarding the protection of animals at the time of their killing or slaughter. This includes <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation 1099/2009 - which replaces Directive 93/119/EC and will come into effect on 1 January 2013.</p>

<p>Directive 93/119/EC has been implemented in Great Britain by the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) (<abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr>) Regulations 1995 - as amended in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2012. The regulations:</p>

<ul>
<li>make it an offence to cause - or permit - avoidable pain, excitement or sufferingÂ to any animal</li>
  <li>state how animals must be handled, stunned, slaughtered or killed</li>
  <li>state thatÂ the peopleÂ involved in moving, lairaging, restraining, stunning, slaughtering or killing any animal must have the knowledge and skill to perform those tasks humanely and efficiently</li>
  <li>state that only permitted methods can be used to stun and kill animals, and the person involved must have a registered licence </li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/slaughter/index.htm">read information on the legal requirements for animal welfare at slaughter on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h2 id="enforcement-of-animal-welfare-at-slaughter">Enforcement of animal welfare at slaughter</h2>

<p>All approved Food Business Operators (<abbr title="Food Business Operators">FBOs</abbr>) are supervised by Official Veterinarians (<abbr title="Official Veterinarians">OVs</abbr>) of the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>). They ensure that all <abbr title="Food Business Operators">FBOs</abbr> comply with rules for:</p>

<ul>
<li>meat hygiene</li>
  <li>animal welfare</li>
  <li>statutory regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Official Veterinarians">OVs</abbr> will take immediate action to correct any problems they find. This action could include written or verbal advice, warnings and -Â if necessary -Â recommendations for prosecution.</p>

<p>If your animals are slaughtered or killed on your farm or at a knackerâs yard, Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) monitors their welfare. While there is not the same level of supervision as at approved premises, veterinary officers will monitor slaughtering during visits to farms. They also regularly visit knackersâ yards andÂ hatcheries, and go to seasonal poultry slaughter premises in the run-up to Christmas.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> follows up on reports and claims of poor welfare practices. If necessary, they will also investigate and prosecute those who donât follow welfare regulations.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/slaughter/index.htm#3">Read enforcement information on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="on-farm-killing-or-slaughtering">On-farm killing or slaughtering</h2>

<p>If you plan to slaughter an animal or bird on your farm, you will need a licence - unless the animal is being killed:</p>

<ul>
<li>for disease control byÂ a competent authority</li>
  <li>by a free bullet in the field by a person who holds a firearms certificate</li>
  <li>because it is suffering and is being killed for emergency reasons relating to the welfare of the animal, and where the animal needs to be killed/slaughtered immediately</li>
  <li>for an ownerâs private consumption</li>
  <li>by a qualified veterinary surgeon</li>
</ul>
<p>Any killing or slaughter must be carried out without causingÂ the animals anyÂ avoidable excitement, pain or suffering. Anyone carrying out killing or slaughter - by means other than a free bullet - must ensure that the animal is restrained appropriately and is stunned before slaughter.</p>

<p>Also note that the Food Hygiene Regulations may apply to on-farm killing. You can get advice on these regulations from the <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="regulations-for-animal-welfare-during-on-farm-slaughter">Regulations for animal welfare during on-farm slaughter</h3>

<p>Killing or slaughtering on the farm must adhere to the <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr> Regulations 1995, as amended. These rules implement European Directive 93/119/EC into UK law. Further amendments to the <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr> Regulations 1995 came into forceÂ on 6 April 2012 through the <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr> Amendment (England) Regulations 2012.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 of <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr> sets out the requirements for licences. Schedule 4 sets out the requirements for restraining animals and parts I and II of Schedule 5 deal with stunning. Schedule 5 also lists the permitted methods of stunning and any specific requirements for those methods. An animal must be killed in accordance with the permitted methods of killing listed in Part III of Schedule 5 of <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Read information about on-farm killing on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/slaughter/index.htm#3a"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>If you are considering slaughtering a bird or animal on your farm, itâs recommended that you contact your veterinary surgeon for advice before the killing takes place. They can advise you on the most appropriate ways to ensure your animalâs welfare before and during the process, in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3 id="killing-birds-and-poultry">Killing birds and poultry</h3>

<p>Birds and poultry may be killed on-farm using gas. The <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr> Amendment (England) Regulations 2012 removed the limitations on the use of gas to cull birds on-farm. The regulations permit the use of gas to kill any type of bird on-farm. In addition, the use of biphasic CO2 is permitted for the killing and slaughter of poultry in a slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>A competent and licensed slaughterman must carry out any gas killing of your birds or poultry. If you are using a bird shed for the gas chamber, this must also be directly supervisedÂ by your veterinary surgeon. You must carry out the killing in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A of <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264340&amp;id=264341">Download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>âs guidance on the welfare of poultry at slaughter or killing from the Agricultural Document Library (ADLib) website (PDF, 494KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="religious-slaughter-of-farmed-animals">Religious slaughter of farmed animals</h2>

<p>There are long-standing provisions in UK law which - subject to specific requirements - allow the slaughter of animals without stunning to meet Jewish and Muslim religious requirements.</p>

<p>Religious slaughter must be carried out only in approved red meat slaughterhouses or, in the case of poultry, in approved or other officially regulated slaughterhouses. Find information on <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/slaughter/qurbani-udhia.htm">religious slaughter for the Muslim community on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="halal-slaughter">Halal slaughter</h3>

<p>Where an animal is slaughtered without prior stunning for consumption by Muslims, the slaughter must be carried out by a Muslim holding a slaughtermanâs licence. It must also take place in a licensed abattoir, in a licensed poultry slaughterhouse under official veterinary supervision, or in other officially regulated poultry slaughterhouses.</p>

<p>Slaughter without prior stunning is not allowed in any other place, even for personal consumption. Only cattle, sheep, goats, turkeys, chickens, hens, guinea fowl, ducks, geese and quail may be slaughtered in accordance with the rules of Islam. </p>

<h3 id="shechita-jewish-slaughter">Shechita Jewish slaughter</h3>

<p>Shechita is the Jewish method of slaughtering animals and poultry for food. It is the only method of producing kosher meat and poultry allowed by Jewish law. Under this law, any stunning is forbidden. The animal must be healthy and killed with respect. It is forbidden to slaughter an animal in front of other animals or to slaughter an animal and its young on the same day.</p>

<p>Shechita is normally performed while the animal is lying on its back, but this is not allowed in the UK. Where an animal is slaughtered without prior stunning for consumption by a Jew, the slaughter must take place in a licensed abattoir, licensed poultry slaughterhouse under official veterinary supervision, or in another officially regulated poultry slaughterhouse. Slaughter without prior stunning is not allowed in any other place.</p>

<p>A shochet performs the shechita. Shochetim are highly trained over a number of years in animal anatomy, pathology and welfare. They are licensed every 12 months by the Rabbinical Commission for the Licensing of Shochetim and must also be licensed by the local authority where they practise.</p>

<h2 id="licensing-and-training-of-slaughtermen">Licensing and training of slaughtermen</h2>

<p>All slaughtermen must comply with the legal requirements of the <abbr title="Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing)">WASK</abbr> as amended. </p>

<p>The regulations require anyone who kills or slaughters animals or birds to hold a provisional or registered licence for the following procedures:</p>

<ul>
<li>restraining an animal to stun, slaughter or kill it</li>
  <li>assessment of effective stunning or killing</li>
  <li>stunning, slaughtering or killingÂ animals</li>
  <li>shackling or hoistingÂ stunned animals</li>
  <li>bleedingÂ animals not yet dead</li>
  <li>pithingÂ stunned animals</li>
</ul>
<p>A licence is not required for the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>emergency slaughter or killing - when anÂ animal needs to be killed immediately</li>
  <li>slaughter or killing by the owner of an animal for his private consumption - when slaughter doesnât take place in a slaughterhouse or knackerâs yard</li>
  <li>slaughter or killing for a non-commercial purpose - âcommercialâ as defined in the Regulations</li>
  <li>killing by using a free bullet in the field</li>
  <li>neck dislocation or decapitation of poultry on agricultural premises where the birds were reared</li>
  <li>usingÂ automatic equipment - where the operator does not carry out any task which would otherwise require a licence</li>
  <li>shackling birds before stunning</li>
  <li>slaughter or killing under the direction of a veterinary surgeon</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a licence is not required to kill:</p>

<ul>
<li>animals for the purposes of disease control</li>
  <li>farmed fox or mink</li>
  <li>surplus chicks or embryos in hatchery waste</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these operations must be carried out in accordance with the specific requirements of the Regulations.</p>

<h3 id="procedures-for-licensing-slaughtermen">Procedures for licensing slaughtermen</h3>

<p>If you wish to become a slaughterman, you must first obtain a provisional licence - the minimum age for this licence is 18 years old. While competence, knowledge and skill to do the work are important, you must also be a âfit and properâ individual.</p>

<p>The provisional licence is valid for up to three months and can be obtained free of charge. It will state the species, equipment types and operations that you are licensed for. During this time, you must work in the presence - and under the direction - of a registered licence holder who works with the same species, equipment and operations. If a registered licence holder is not available, then you must work under the direction of a veterinary surgeon.</p>

<p>There are no exams to sit to become a licensed slaughterman, but you will be assessed under normal working conditions after undergoing on-the-job training. This assessment is normally carried out by <abbr title="Official Veterinarians">OVs</abbr> at the slaughterhouse where you work.</p>

<p>If you work at other premises, youâll need to apply to your localÂ <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> and they will arrange for you to be assessed by one of their Veterinary Officers (<abbr title="Veterinary Officers">VOs</abbr>). </p>

<p>When you successfully pass your assessment, you will receive a Certificate of Competence (<abbr title="Certificate of Competence">CoC</abbr>) for the species, equipment and operations you studied for.</p>

<h3 id="registered-licence">Registered licence</h3>

<p>Your registered licence is permanent and valid throughout Great Britain. It covers the species, equipment and operations that are listed on your <abbr title="Certificate of Competence">CoC</abbr>. If you wish to add new species, operations or equipment, then you need to apply for a provisional licence for those areas.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2010, a registered licence costs Â£26. If you need to register changes to it - or have it replaced - there is a Â£7 fee.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h3>

<p>If you wish to apply for a provisional licence or <abbr title="Certificate of Competence">CoC</abbr>, you must complete Form WAS 1. If you work in a licensed slaughterhouse, give it to the <abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr>. Alternatively, you will need to send it to your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Find an application for a provisional licence to kill or slaughter animals on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/2011/03/30/was1-provlicence-killanimal/"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You should include a cheque for Â£40 for an <abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr> assessment at a licensed slaughterhouse and Â£117.80 per hour if you need a visit from an <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <abbr title="Veterinary Officer">VO</abbr>. This fee is payable in advance and is not refundable.</p>

<p>To apply for a registered licence, you should complete Form WAS 4.</p>

<p>You must send your certificate or Rabbinical Licence (if applicable), a registration fee and two passport-style photographs with your name written on the back of each photo to the <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> Agency.

<h2 id="support-and-advice">Support and advice</h2>

<p>Several organisations offer support and advice to farmers about the welfare of animals at slaughter.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> aims to help the farming industry operate as efficiently as possible. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> administers European Commission support policies that provide around Â£3 billion to UK agriculture. They also oversee a number of agencies that work with farmers, regulate imports and exports of crops and implement pest and disease controls. For more information on this you can call the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> Helpline on Tel 08459 33 55 77.</p>

<p>The AHLVA is a <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> agency responsible for ensuring that farm animals in the UK are healthy and well cared for. Working together with local authorities, <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> officers - who are based in regional <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agencies">AHVLAs</abbr> - carry out farm inspections to enforce farmed animal welfare law.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> is the central competent authority in the UK responsible for carrying out official controls. These controls require specified inspections of all animals, carcasses and offal through risk-based audits to verify that approved fresh meat premises comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Food Hygiene Regulations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> also undertakes official controls on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> on animal health and welfare to ensure compliance with legislative requirements. It carries out these controls in slaughterhouses, cutting plants, farmed and wild game facilities, and co-located minced meat and meat products premises. The <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> has a statutory duty to provide these services on demand, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, throughout England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>You will come into contact with local authorities over a number of animal welfare, farming, land use, food standards and environmental regulations. Your local authority may also be able to provide further information or resources. </p>

<p>Local authority and <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> animal welfare enforcement powers include:</p>

<ul>
<li>emergency powers in relation to animals in distress</li>
  <li>powers of entry and inspection, including the power to seize documents</li>
  <li>prosecution powers</li>
  <li>the authority to serve improvement notices</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an offence to obstruct an inspector in the course of their duty.</p>

<p>In England, the Farm Advisory System advises farmers about cross compliance. For further information, call the Cross Compliance Helpline on Tel 0845 345 1302. Alternatively, find information on cross compliance requirements on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.crosscompliance.org.uk">Cross Compliance website.</a></p>

<p>Find information about animal welfare on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farming-advice/cross-compliance/">Cross Compliance website.</a></p>

<p>Natural England is another <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> agency that works to ensure sustainable use and management of the natural environment. It hosts events around the country, including cross compliance farm walks and farming drop-in clinics.</p>

<p>The Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) is responsible for licences and schemes for farmers, as well as for running the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>). For more information about the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> and how it can help your farming business, you can call the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on Tel 0845 603 7777.</p>

<p>You can also read the guide on the SPS.</p>

<p>The National Farmersâ Union (<abbr title="National Farmers' Union">NFU</abbr>) represents the farmers and growers of England and Wales. It aims to promote successful and socially responsible agriculture and horticulture, while ensuring the long-term viability of rural communities.</p>
