</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>For Winter 2012 to 2013, you can get a £130 discount on your electricity bill. </p>

<p>The money is not paid to you, it’s a one-off discount on your electricity bill, usually between October and March. </p>

<h2>Pre-pay or pay as you go customers</h2>

<p>People using pre-pay or pay as you go electricity meters can also qualify for the discount. </p>

<p>If eligible, your electricity supplier can tell you how you’ll get the discount. For example, a voucher you can use to top up your meter.</p>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>Usually, you qualify for the discount if on 21 July 2012 your supplier was part of the scheme, your name (or your partner’s) was on the bill and you were either: </p>

<ul>
<li>80 or over and getting the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit </li>
  <li>under 80 and only getting the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You might still get the discount even if you don’t qualify.</p>
</div>

<p>Some suppliers offer the discount to people who wouldn’t normally qualify. They have their own rules about who else can get the discount – contact them to check their rules. </p>
