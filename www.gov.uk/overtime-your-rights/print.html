  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><h2>What is overtime?</h2>
<p>If you have normal working hours, overtime usually means any time you work beyond these hours. </p>

<p>Normal working hours are the hours fixed by your employment contract.</p>

<h2>Overtime pay</h2>
<p>Your employer doesn’t have to pay you for overtime. However, your average pay for the total hours you’ve worked mustn’t fall below the <a href="/your-right-to-minimum-wage" title="Your right to the minimum wage">National Minimum Wage</a>.</p>

<p>Your <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="Employment contracts and conditions">employment contract</a> will usually include details of any overtime pay rates and how they’re worked out.</p>

</article><article id="compulsory-overtime"><header><h1>Part 2: Compulsory overtime</h1>
  </header><h2>Can you be forced to work overtime?</h2>
<p>You only have to work overtime if your contract says so. </p>

<p>Even if it does, by law, you can’t usually be forced to work more than an average of <a href="/maximum-weekly-working-hours" title="Maximum weekly working hours">48 hours per week</a>. You can agree to work longer - this agreement must be in writing and signed by you.</p>

<h2>Can you be stopped from working overtime?</h2>
<p>Unless your contract guarantees you overtime, your employer can stop you working it. </p>

<p>However, your employer can’t <a href="/discrimination-your-rights/discrimination-at-work" title="Discrimination at work">discriminate against you</a>, eg by letting others work overtime but stopping you from doing so.</p>

</article><article id="parttime-workers"><header><h1>Part 3: Part-time workers</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Usually, <a href="/part-time-worker-rights" title="Part-time workers' rights">part-time workers</a> mustn’t be treated less favourably than full-time staff.</p>
</div>

<p>Unless it says differently in your employment contract, your employer will usually only pay you overtime if you work:</p>

<ul>
<li>longer hours than set out in your contract</li>
  <li>more than the normal working hours of full-time staff and full-time staff would get extra pay for working these hours</li>
  <li>unsocial hours (eg late at night) for which full-time staff would get more pay</li>
</ul></article><article id="time-off-and-paid-leave"><header><h1>Part 4: Time off and paid leave</h1>
  </header><h2>Time off in lieu (TOIL)</h2>
<p>Some employers give you time off instead of paying for overtime. This is known as ‘time off in lieu’. </p>

<p>The terms (eg when you can take it) are agreed between you and your employer.</p>
