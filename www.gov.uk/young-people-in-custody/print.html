  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>People under 18 who are sentenced to custody aren’t sent to adult prisons, but to secure centres for young people.</p>

<h2>Why young people are sent to custody</h2>

<p>A court can give a young person a <a href="/types-of-prison-sentence/sentences-for-young-people" title="Types of prison sentence for young people">custodial sentence</a> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the crime is so serious there is no other suitable option </li>
  <li>the young person has committed crimes before </li>
  <li>the judge or magistrate thinks the young person is a risk to the public</li>
</ul>
<p>A young person can also be sent to custody on <a href="/charged-crime/remand" title="Being put on remand">remand</a>.</p>

<p>The Youth Justice Board decides which secure centre a young person will be sent to.</p>

<p>They will choose somewhere that:</p>

<ul>
<li>can deal with the young person’s needs safely (eg if they have a health problem)</li>
  <li>is suitable for their age, sex and background</li>
  <li>is as near to their home as possible</li>
</ul></article><article id="arriving-at-custody"><header><h1>Part 2: Arriving at custody</h1>
  </header><h2>Interview and assessment</h2>

<p>The young person is interviewed by the reception officer as soon as they arrive.</p>

<p>The reception officer uses this interview to make sure the young person is properly looked after - eg if they need any health care.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>The young person will have some of their belongings taken away, like their money and phone. </p>

<p>They will also be searched to make sure they don’t have things on them like drugs.</p>

<h2>Personal officer</h2>

<p>Within the first few days, the young person will meet their personal officer. This person is in charge of the young person’s well-being for as long as they are in the secure centre.</p>

</article><article id="what-custody-is-like-for-young-people"><header><h1>Part 3: What custody is like for young people</h1>
  </header><p>Time in custody is spent:</p>

<ul>
<li>in lessons</li>
  <li>learning skills to get a job or to return to education</li>
  <li>taking part in programmes to improve behaviour</li>
  <li>participating in sport, fitness, and other activities</li>
</ul>
<p>There are strict rules about what young people can and can’t do, and they may have to go through alcohol or drug counselling.</p>

<h2>Types of secure centre</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of custody for young people:</p>

<ul>
<li>young offender institutions </li>
  <li>secure training centres </li>
  <li>secure children’s homes</li>
</ul>

<h2>If the young person is on remand</h2>

<p>Contact the young person’s <a href="/youth-offending-team" title="Youth offending teams">youth offending team</a>, who can organise a visit.</p>


</article><article id="advice-and-support"><header><h1>Part 5: Advice and support</h1>
  </header><p>For advice or support, a young person can speak to a member of staff, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>their personal officer</li>
  <li>a chaplain, social worker or teacher</li>
  <li>a doctor, nurse or other health worker</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal officer is the person in charge of the young person’s well-being.</p>

<p>Chaplains provide support to everyone, whatever their faith. A young person can ask to speak to a chaplain of their own faith if they want.</p>

<h2>Support from the youth offending team</h2>

<p>Someone from the local <a href="/youth-offending-team" title="Youth offending teams">youth offending team</a> will continue to stay in contact with the young person when they are in custody. The young person can get in touch with them whenever they need.</p>

<h2>Friends and family</h2>

<p>A young person will be able to contact their family regularly, and can arrange for them to <a href="visiting-young-people-in-custody" title="Visiting young people in custody">visit</a>.</p>

<h2>Advocacy services</h2>

<p>Young people can also speak to someone from an <a href="advocacy-services" title="Advocacy services">advocacy service</a>.</p>


</article><article id="advocacy-services"><header><h1>Part 6: Advocacy services</h1>

  <li>don’t understand something</li>
  <li>can’t make themselves understood</li>
