<h2 id="recognition-1">Recognition</h2>

<p>The veterans team is responsible for ensuring that former service in the Armed Forces is recognised, appreciated and valued by both the government and general public. It does this by formulating, developing, evaluating and reviewing policy taking account of financial and presentational aspects.</p>

<h3 id="raising-awareness">Raising awareness</h3>

<p>The Veterans team is responsible for raising awareness of the role of veterans and their contribution to society, through initiatives such as <a rel="external" href="http://www.armedforcesday.org.uk/Default.aspx" title="Armed Forces Day website">Armed Forces Day</a>, and the provision of HM Armed Forces and UK Merchant Seafarers Veterans Lapel Badges.</p>

<h3 id="heroes-return-2">Heroes Return 2</h3>

They can also receive funding to take part in an official commemorations in the UK. </p>

<p>Originally scheduled to close in January 2011, the scheme has been extended and will continue to run until 31 December 2012.</p>

<h2 id="transition-1">Transition</h2>

<p>Information about some of the issues which may affect Servicemen and women who are due to leave and veterans who have left the Armed Forces, including homelessness and support for veterans in the criminal justice system.</p>

<h3 id="support-following-discharge">Support following discharge</h3>

<p>A smooth transition to civilian life is about ensuring ex-Service personnel have the support they need once they have been discharged from the Armed Forces. </p>

<p>The vast majority of the 20,000 Servicemen and women leaving the Armed Forces each year make the transition from Service to civilian life without significant difficulties. However, there are some who do need additional support. The current focus is on homeless veterans and veterans in the criminal justice system.</p>

<h3 id="homeless-veterans">Homeless veterans</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> supports a co-ordinated approach to meet the needs of ex-Service personnel, working with policy leads from across government to ensure that those ex-Service personnel who require support in securing accommodation receive appropriate assistance. The Department for Communities and Local Government (<abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government">DCLG</abbr>) in England and the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have primary responsibility for homelessness policy.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>The Combined Homelessness and Information Network (<abbr title="Combined Homelessness and Information Network">CHAIN</abbr>) provide data on the number of veterans seen rough sleeping in London. </p>

<p>The latest <abbr title="Combined Homelessness and Information Network">CHAIN</abbr> survey (funded by <abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government">DCLG</abbr>) estimated that 3% of those found rough sleeping in London, from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011, had previously served in HM Armed Forces. The number of veterans who are ‘statutory’ homeless is not available.  </p>

<h3 id="supported-housing">Supported housing</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> has supported the establishment of two supported housing schemes for ex-Service personnel - Mike Jackson House in Aldershot, which opened in 2008 and The Beacon at Catterick, which opened to residents in September 2011. The focus is on helping individuals in Service to ensure the risk of becoming homeless is minimised through the provision of schemes which offer affordable housing solutions.</p>

<h3 id="early-service-leavers">Early Service Leavers</h3>

<p>Early Service Leavers have been identified as a group particularly at risk of facing homelessness. This group receive appropriate assistance, however, it must be recognised that those who leave early tend to be vulnerable individuals from the outset, rather than become vulnerable as a result of their short career in the Armed Forces.</p>

<h3 id="veterans-in-the-criminal-justice-system">Veterans in the Criminal Justice System</h3>

<p>Veterans in prison</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) have been working to provide up to date and authoritative data on the number of veterans in prison in England and Wales. Defence Analytical Services and Advice (<abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr>) of the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> have estimated that, as at November 2009, Regular ex-Service Personnel represented 3.5% of offenders in prison. </p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr> have also determined that ex-Service personnel in prison are predominantly male, British nationals, ex-Army other ranks. The time between discharge from the Armed Forces and the start of their current prison sentence ranged from 0 to 41 years. However, <abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr> estimated that for males aged 18 to 54, the proportion of ex-Service personnel in prison was 30% less than the proportion of the general population in the same age group.</p>

<p>Veterans on Probation</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr> has also determined that, as at 30 September 2009, 3.4% of those supervised by Probation Trusts in England and Wales had previously served as Regulars in the UK Armed Forces. </p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr> also found this group to be predominately male, ex-Army other rank, with 50% being aged 35 years and over. The time between discharge from the Armed Forces and the start of their current supervision record varied from 0 to 47 years, with 49% having received their supervision record within 10 years of leaving and only 6% within a year of leaving. </p>

<p>Information on previous cases of supervision records for these individuals was not available. However, <abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr> estimated that overall, a male member of the general population aged 18 to 54 was 12% more likely to have a probation supervision record than a former member of the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>You can read more about <abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr>’s findings in the three <abbr title="Defence Analytical Services and Advice">DASA</abbr> reports. </p>

<h2 id="ex-service-offenders-working-group">Ex Service Offenders Working Group</h2>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>
<p>The Ex-Service Offenders Working Group (ESOWG) is a non-executive group with a clear reporting chain within the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> and the MOJ who each report to their respective Ministers. This ensures that the Working Group remains core business.</p>

<p>The Working Group aims to ensure that the ex-service prison and probation offender population, their families and the Resettlement Services, are fully informed of the forms and levels of support and assistance available from the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (<abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>) and the Voluntary and Community Sector.</p>

<p>This support and assistance applies during imprisonment as well as pre and post discharge. This work is designed to contribute to wider government policy for reducing the risk of reoffending by those offenders either in custody or serving community sentences, and ensure a common and collaborative approach to veterans in the criminal justice system across the UK, including coordination, communication and effective working practices between all the major stakeholders.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

<h2 id="homelessness">Homelessness</h2>

<h3 id="homelessness-definition">Homelessness definition</h3>

<p>Homelessness is defined as having no permanent accommodation, and includes people in hostels and those couch-surfing. Rough sleeping is only those people actually sleeping on the streets.</p>

<h3 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h3>

<p>The primary responsibility for homelessness policy lies with <abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government">DCLG</abbr> in England and the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Each policy lead has a strategy for handling homelessness among the general population and assigning social housing to particular individuals. </p>

<p>There are variations in the way that waiting lists are operated by the social housing provider, for example, a Local Authority, Housing Association, or Registered Social Landlord, as responsibility has been devolved to them provided they operate within the framework of the centrally agreed Housing regulations.</p>

<p>While in-Service, accommodation needs are met by the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> and so in-Service personnel are a low priority on a social housing waiting lists.</p>

<h3 id="local-connection">Local connection</h3>

<p>Until recently, no recognition was given to Service personnel if, on leaving the Armed Forces, they wanted to apply for social housing in an area local to their duty station; their application could only be based on their place of origin. This meant some Service leavers struggled to secure accommodation.</p>

<p>Legislation changed in England, Scotland and Wales to enable Service personnel to establish a ‘local connection’ with the area in which they are serving or have served to allow parity of treatment with civilians already living in the area with regards to accessing social housing. This puts the Armed Forces on an equal footing to others when applying for social housing. The changes do not mean that Service personnel can ‘queue jump’ others on the social waiting list. Where they still have an entitlement to <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> accommodation, they would be treated the same as anybody else who is suitably housed but wish to apply for social housing, i.e. at low priority. The provisions in Northern Ireland are already of a good standard.</p>

<h3 id="certificate-of-cessation">Certificate of Cessation</h3>

<p>Service personnel can inform the social housing provider that they will lose their entitlement to <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> accommodation up to 6 months in advance of a discharge date through issue of a Certificate of Cessation to Occupation of <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> living accommodation. This warns the social housing provider that the housing options available need to be considering, taking into account family construct, future employment, and the individual’s finances. It does not mean an automatic entitlement to social housing, or a ticket to move to the top of the waiting list.</p>

<p>There is often some misunderstanding of the role of the Certificate. There is a perception that this takes the place of a social housing application, or gives an automatic entitlement to social housing on or before discharge date. The Certificate is only a guidance note for social housing providers. It is not legislative, but it should alert all parties to start engaging on housing options for the individual in advance of a discharge date. This minimises uncertainty for the individual and prevents <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> having to go to court to gain a Possession Order for the Service accommodation.</p>

<h3 id="possession-orders">Possession Orders</h3>

<p>Homelessness legislation only applies to a Service person once a Possession Order has been issued. The effect of the issuing of Possession Order is that the Service person’s social housing application moves from consideration under social housing regulations to homelessness legislation. Under homelessness legislation, the Service person’s application is prioritised, depending upon circumstances (family construct and finances), and they may be given temporary/interim living accommodation (such as bed &amp; breakfast), until a permanent solution can be found. A permanent solution may vary from family to family depending on circumstances, availability and timelines.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-homeless-veterans-mike-jackson-house">Supporting homeless veterans: Mike Jackson House</h2>

<p>Mike Jackson House (<abbr title="Mike Jackson House">MJH</abbr>) is a supported housing project based in Aldershot specifically designed for homeless veterans.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mike Jackson House">MJH</abbr>’s main aim is to support and assist veterans back into an independent way of living.</p>

<p>The accommodation block, which has 25 furnished, self-contained flats, is located in Aldershot and was opened to tenants in July 2008. It is named after General Sir Mike Jackson who was formerly Head of the British Army and is run by the English Churches Housing Group (<abbr title="English Churches Housing Group">ECHG</abbr>), part of the Riverside Group who receive annual funding from Hampshire County Council.</p>

<p>Clients ages have ranged from 17 through to 61, presenting with numerous support needs from alcohol and drugs issues, mental health, post traumatic stress disorders, homelessness, unemployment and poor education skills.</p>

<p>The staff at <abbr title="Mike Jackson House">MJH</abbr> are pro-active in finding solutions and support to help the tenants achieve their goals whilst they stay at <abbr title="Mike Jackson House">MJH</abbr>. They currently employ 3 Support Workers and 1 Peer Support Worker, with a client caseload of 7 clients each with the Peer Support Worker picking up the remaining 4 clients who present the most challenging behaviour.</p>

<h3 id="facilities">Facilities</h3>

<p>Communal areas - places for veterans to meet and chat with fellow peers, providing a relaxing atmosphere for staff to relax with the veterans, away from an interview room setting.</p>

<p>IT Suite - This is the most used facility in the scheme. <abbr title="Mike Jackson House">MJH</abbr> have to operate a booking system as it is always full, they currently have five PC’s run it on the same basis as an internet café for the residents.</p>

<p>Training Kitchen - Staff have supported residents in cooking skills, cooking on a budget, skills that 90% of the veterans had not previously acquired.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-homeless-veterans-the-beacon">Supporting homeless veterans: The Beacon</h2>

<p>The Beacon is a new facility in Catterick for homeless single ex-service leavers and those who are at risk of becoming homeless.</p>

<p>The Beacon provides a supported housing facility for 31 homeless veterans and opened to residents in September 2011. It is managed and operated by Riverside English Churches Housing Group (RECHG) in Catterick near the existing garrison. It provides training and support (e.g. a training kitchen, a workshop, IT suite and garden are some of the partnering arrangements that will come on stream in due course). It is able to accept complex referrals, such as veterans with PTSD and substance abuse issues.</p>

<p>The Prince’s Trust also plan to run an entrepreneurship programme at The Beacon using part of a £5 million fund provided by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for supporting veterans under the age of 30 to run their own businesses.</p>

<p>The Beacon’s official opening will take place in early 2012. <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> gifted the land on which the scheme is built and provided start-up funding from the Veterans Challenge Fund. Partnership funding was also secured for the Homes and Communities Agency and the <abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government">DCLG</abbr>, in addition to voluntary and community sector organisations.</p>

<h2 id="ministerial-working-group-on-preventing-and-tackling-homelessness">Ministerial Working Group on Preventing and Tackling Homelessness</h2>

<p>The aim of the Ministerial Working Group is to improve people’s lives by preventing and tackling homelessness. By bringing the relevant government departments together to share information, resolve issues and avoid unintended policy consequences, we will be able to help enable communities to tackle the multi-faceted issues that contribute to homelessness.</p>

<p>Formal policy decisions made by the Working Group will be subject to the usual processes of collective Cabinet Committee clearance. </p>

<p>The Working Group will usually meet quarterly.</p>

<h2 id="voluntary-and-community-sector-1">Voluntary and Community Sector</h2>

<p><abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> works closely with many different organisations within the Voluntary and Community Sector. We are committed to working in partnership with the ex-Service charitable sector to deliver a high level of support where needed and particularly to the more vulnerable individuals in the Armed Forces Community.</p>

<p>There is a long and distinguished history of charitable contributions supporting the welfare and recreation of Service personnel and veterans. Many charities have historical connections with the Armed Forces, The Royal British Legion and SSAFA-Forces Help are good examples.</p>

<p>The Defence Budget cannot meet every welfare and recreational need that is identified among the Armed Forces Community. The continuing generous support of charities sits alongside the provision of facilities from public funds, as is the practice in many walks of life in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Forging stronger partnerships by building on existing arrangements and developing better relationships with the Voluntary and Community Sector helps to meet these welfare and recreational needs.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> the lead responsibility for Voluntary and Community Sector issues rests with the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel and Training). Several areas within Head Office, including DCDS Pers and the Director of Media and Communications enjoy a good relationship with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.cobseo.org.uk" title="Website for the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations">Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations</a> (<abbr title="Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations">COBSEO</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations">COBSEO</abbr> is a membership organisation of 169 organisations, including 66 Regimental Associations. Their members range from larger charities such as <a rel="external" href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk" title="Royal British Legion website">The Royal British Legion</a> and the British Limbless Ex Servicemen’s Association to smaller organisations such as the Burma Star Association. <abbr title="Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations">COBSEO</abbr> provides a focus to communicate the concerns of its member organisations, and to consult with the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> ensuring that the needs of the Armed Forces Community are considered when <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> polices are developed.</p>

<p>Practical examples of Voluntary and Community sector partnerships include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Welfare Pathway</li>
  <li>Army Recovery Capability</li>
  <li>Mental Health Pilots</li>
</ul>
<p>Identified needs could be as individual as a seriously injured serving soldier requiring adaptations to their property to the provision of a supported housing facility for Service leavers at risk of becoming homeless. </p>

<h2 id="commemoration-war-graves">Commemoration: war graves</h2>

<p>Members of the Armed Forces who died during either of the two World Wars, between 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921, and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 are buried in official World War graves. The graves of Service personnel who died after 1947 are categorised as non-World War graves. The definition of non-World War graves also encompasses the graves of those Service dependents who died overseas, while accompanying Service personnel, and are buried in military cemeteries.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s commitment to the maintenance of Service graves is largely determined by the age of the grave. </p>

<h3 id="pre-world-war-1">Pre-World War 1</h3>

<p>Before World War 1, the burying of the deceased was traditionally a function of the Ship or Regiment to which they belonged. No formal assistance was offered by the, then, Admiralty or War Office, and only a limited number of such graves are maintained at <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s expense. These are generally graves located in a military cemetery funded by the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> where all graves are maintained automatically and failure to do so would detract from the overall appearance of the cemetery.</p>

<h3 id="world-war-1-and-2">World War 1 and 2</h3>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.cwgc.org" title="Commonwealth War Graves Commission website">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> (<abbr title="Commonweath War Graves Commision">CWGC</abbr>) was established and is funded to provide a permanent official commemoration for those who died in the two World Wars. It maintains in perpetuity the graves and the official memorials which commemorate those who have no known graves. The <abbr title="Commonweath War Graves Commision">CWGC</abbr>’s principle of non-repatriation of war dead was implemented for both World Wars so that those who fought and fell together could be honoured together. The UK government, one of the six member Commonwealth countries supporting the <abbr title="Commonweath War Graves Commision">CWGC</abbr>, contributes over 78% of the funding for this work which is proportionate to our number of war dead.</p>

<h3 id="the-inter-war-years">The inter-war years</h3>

<p>Between 1 September 1921 and 2 September 1939, responsibility for Service burials reverted to the pre-1914 arrangements whereby Ships, Regiments and Units buried their own dead without central assistance. However, dependent on Service, some casualties were provided with an official headstone and, in some instances, they received a Service (as distinct from a private) funeral. Exceptionally, these relatively few graves are maintained at public expense. As with pre-World War 1 graves, inter-war year graves may be maintained at public expense if they are located in a military cemetery funded by the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> where all graves are maintained automatically and failure to do so would detract from the overall appearance of the cemetery.</p>

<h3 id="and-beyond">1948 and beyond</h3>

<p>Since 1 January 1948, it has been the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s policy that if a member of the Armed Forces dies in service, their next of kin (<abbr title="Next of kin">NOK</abbr>) are offered the opportunity of the individual having a Service funeral and official headstone, to be maintained in perpetuity at public expense. </p>

<p>Service personnel and, if serving overseas, their accompanying dependents, who died post 1 January 1948, were buried in non-World War graves locally or could be repatriated at private expense for a private funeral. </p>

<p>In 1963, the UK government’s policy of non-repatriation changed and if Service personnel or their accompanying dependents died whilst serving in North West Europe, next of kin were allowed the choice of either repatriating and burying the body at public expense or for two relatives to travel out to attend the Service funeral overseas. </p>

<p>In 1967, the policy was extended to cover the rest of the world. </p>

<p>It was decided at the time that these arrangements would not be retrospective. However, Service personnel, or their accompanying dependents, who died whilst serving overseas after 1 January 1948 can be repatriated at private expense for a private funeral.</p>

<h3 id="private-graves">Private graves</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> will maintain in perpetuity the graves of all personnel who died in Service on or after 1 January 1948, who had both a Service funeral and a Service headstone, and the grave has been registered to the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr>. Where the <abbr title="Next of kin">NOK</abbr> elect to have a private funeral, or choose a non-<abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> pattern headstone, the graves are maintained privately and the <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> has no responsibility for them.</p>

<h2 id="non-regular-permanent-staff---pension-and-attributable-benefits-schemes-and-nrps-redundancy-scheme-regulations">Non Regular Permanent Staff - Pension and Attributable Benefits Schemes and NRPS Redundancy Scheme Regulations</h2>

<h3 id="non-regular-permanent-staff-pension-scheme">Non Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme</h3>

<p>The Non Regular Permanent Staff pension scheme, previously under Chapter 9 of TA Regulations 1978, has been re-stated in Schedule 1 of the Defence Council Regulations and contains no fundamental change to the benefits payable.</p>

<p>The re-made Scheme incorporates amendments required as a result of changes to occupational pension legislation including provisions for pensions on divorce, payment to civil partners and increasing the upper age limit for payment of children’s pensions. It also makes provision to pay pensions for life to all adult dependants where death is caused by Service, reflecting changes to <abbr title="Ministry  of Defence">MOD</abbr> policy. The attributable benefits for injury or death caused by Service have been removed to a separate scheme to comply with tax legislation.</p>

<h3 id="non-regular-permanent-staff-attributable-benefits-scheme">Non Regular Permanent Staff Attributable Benefits Scheme</h3>

<p>A <a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/BCB11994-82E5-45DD-8900-8250C481E2D5/0/NRPSPensionandAttribBenefitsSchemesRegs2011.pdf" title="Download Non Regular Permanent Staff Attributable Benefits Scheme">separate attributable benefits scheme</a> has been established at Schedule 2 of the Defence Council Regulations for injury or death caused by Service before 6 April 2005. (payment for injury or death caused by Service from 6 April 2005 is made under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme). This is because the Finance Act 2004 introduced a new pension tax regime under which payments from a pension scheme for attributable injury or death would be unauthorised payments and tax charges would be levied on both the individual member of the scheme and the pension scheme. There are no changes to the level of benefits previously set out in Chapter 9 of TA Regulations 1978. but in line with changes to the pension scheme provision is made to pay benefits to civil partners and unmarried partners, and benefits to all adult dependants are payable for life.</p>

<h3 id="non-regular-permanent-staff-redundancy-scheme">Non Regular Permanent Staff Redundancy Scheme</h3>

<p>On 9 August 2012, <a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/06D54984-7D96-4F8F-A895-EBA3407D9144/0/20120809NRPSRedundancySchemeRegulations2012.pdf" title="Download Reserve Forces Non Regular Permanent Staff (Redundancy Scheme) Regulations">The Reserve Forces Non Regular Permanent Staff (Redundancy Scheme) Regulations</a> were extended to members of the NRPS who are made redundant.

<h2 id="medical-and-dental-officers-bonus-scheme">Medical and Dental Officers Bonus Scheme</h2>

<p>The bonus arrangements for Medical and Dental Officers replace the benefits available to members of Armed Forces Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>) 05 (and those who have opted out) under the Early Departure Payments (<abbr title="Early departure payments">EDP</abbr>) Scheme.</p>

<p>The bonus arrangements not only replace the <abbr title="Early departure payments">EDP</abbr>, but also the Commission Transfer Grant (<abbr title="Commission Transfer Grant">CTG</abbr>) currently paid to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (<abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr>) who transfer from a ‘short’ to ‘medium’ commission. <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr> who chose to transfer to <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> 05 and are eligible for the first primary care bonuses having already received a <abbr title="Commission Transfer Grant">CTG</abbr> will receive the bonus payment less the value of the <abbr title="Commission Transfer Grant">CTG</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-i-find-out-more-about-the-bonus-scheme">Where do I find out more about the Bonus Scheme?</h3>

<h2 id="pension-tax-relief---annual-allowance-and-scheme-pays">Pension Tax Relief - annual allowance and scheme pays</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-the-annual-allowance">What is the Annual Allowance?</h3>

<p>This is the annual limit on pensions savings, i.e. the annual growth in the value of the pension pot, allowed without incurring a tax charge. In the case of the Armed Forces pension schemes, this is the amount of value that can be added each year to the value of the pension.</p>

<p>Significant changes to the Annual Allowance (<abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr>) came into effect on 6 April 2011 when the annual tax free allowance was reduced from £255,000 to £50,000.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-likely-to-be-affected">Who Is likely to be affected?</h3>

<p>Only a small number of Service personnel will exceed the new limit on the basis of their Armed Forces pension alone. Other Ranks are highly unlikely to be affected by these changes, but some officers may incur a tax liability on promotion. This is likely to start to impact on promotion from OF3 (Major and equivalent) to OF4 (Lieutenant Colonel and equivalent), particularly for those promoting late in their career; but the most pronounced effect is expected at the ranks of OF5 (Colonel and equivalent) and above. Additionally, the most senior officers (OF7 and above) may also incur a tax liability as a consequence of annual pay increments.</p>

<h3 id="the-introduction-of-scheme-pays">The introduction of Scheme Pays</h3>

<p>On 11 Aug 11 HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HN Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) introduced a process called Scheme Pays to assist individuals in meeting part or all of any tax bill arising as a result of breaching the <abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr>. Armed Forces Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>) members who incur an <abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr> tax bill exceeding £2,000 may elect for the tax due to be paid by the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>. This amount will then be recovered by a reduction in the pension benefits paid on retirement. </p>

<h3 id="breaching-the-annual-allowance">Breaching The Annual Allowance</h3>

<p>Individuals who exceed the <abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr> because of the growth in the value of their <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> benefits will be alerted by <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>, via pension statements sent by the end of October following the end of the tax year (October 2012 for FY 11/12).  Where the <abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr> is exceeded, individuals will need to declare this to <abbr title="HN Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> via a Self Assessment Tax Return, due no later than 31 Jan following the end of the tax year (31 Jan 13 for FY 11/12).</p>

<p><abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> cannot take into account any personal pension arrangements that individuals may have made when calculating potential <abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr> tax charges.</p>

<p>Individuals who believe that they may have exceeded the <abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr> because of a combination of personal and <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr> pension savings must make their own independent calculations for the cumulative value of all pension schemes.</p>

<p>Service personnel may request a pension statement to assist them with this calculation once per year free of charge by writing to <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>. This can be requested at any time and in addition to the statement that will be issued in October.</p>

<h3 id="electing-scheme-pays-and-other-methods-of-meeting-the-tax-charge">Electing Scheme Pays and other methods of meeting the tax charge</h3>

<p>Individuals will need to request a Scheme Pays forecast from <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr>, a request proforma will be issued alongside the <abbr title="Annual Allowance">AA</abbr> pension statement. Upon issuing the forecast, <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> will also automatically issue an election form for Scheme Pays. </p>

<p>Members should give careful consideration as to which method of meeting the tax charge is most appropriate for them given their financial circumstance and should seek independent financial advice if needed. This may include a personal payment in full, or in part payment in conjunction with Scheme Pays, to meet the charge.</p>

<h3 id="adjustment-of-tax-code">Adjustment of tax code</h3>

<p>For tax charges below £3,000 individuals can request <abbr title="HN Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to adjust their tax code to allow the tax charge to be recovered. A request for a tax code adjustment needs to be made directly to <abbr title="HN Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in the normal self assessment process. The deadline for requesting this facility is 30 December.</p>

<p><abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> will not be able to provide advice or guidance on meeting the tax charge via tax code adjustments.</p>

<h3 id="deadline-for-electing-scheme-pays">Deadline for electing Scheme Pays</h3>

<p>The deadline for completing an election form for Scheme Pays will normally be the 31 July in the year following the year in which the tax charge relates ended. For the first year of operation (FY 2011/12) this deadline has been extended to 31 Dec 2013.</p>

<p><abbr title="HN Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> must also be informed of a decision to elect for Scheme Pays by 31 Jan following the end of the tax year. This is done through the normal Self-Assessment Tax Return process. For 2011/12 the deadline will be 31 Jan 2013.</p>

<h2 id="pension-tax-relief---lifetime-allowance">Pension Tax Relief - Lifetime Allowance</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-the-lifetime-allowance">What is the Lifetime Allowance?</h3>

<p>Lifetime Allowance (<abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr>) is the limit on total pension savings eligible for tax relief. It was initially introduced in tax year 2006 to 2007 at a limit of £1.5 million, rising to £1.8 million in 2010 to 2011. From 6 April 2012 the <abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr> limit was reduced from £1.8 million to £1.5 million.  If the <abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr> is exceeded a tax charge is applied.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr> applies to the total amount of pension savings held in registered pension schemes, including occupational pension schemes such as the Armed Forces pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr> is assessed either at point of retirement or when pension benefits are drawn. Any tax due is automatically recovered from the pension, with a reduced pension being paid. Widows/Widowers and Dependants pension benefits will be calculated on the unreduced pension.</p>

<h3 id="what-changes-have-been-introduced-to-the-lta">What Changes Have Been Introduced To The <abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr>?</h3>

<p>On 11 August 2011 <abbr title="HN Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> announced the availability of a protection regime called Fixed Protection to assist individuals who have or expect to have a pension pot in excess of £1.5 million (for Armed Forces Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Scheme">AFPS</abbr>), broadly equivalent to an annual pension of £65,000) after 6 April 2012.</p>

<p>Fixed Protection allows an individual to ‘fix’ his/her <abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr> up to a maximum of £1.8 million after 6 April 2012, rather than the reduced <abbr title="Lifetime Allowance">LTA</abbr> of £1.5 million. Members had to notify <abbr title="Service Personnel and Veterans Agency">SPVA</abbr> of their intention to apply for Fixed Protection by 31 March 2012 and <abbr title="HN Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 05 April 2012.  Members can no longer apply for Fixed Protection.</p>
