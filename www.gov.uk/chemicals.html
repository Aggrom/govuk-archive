<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide provides an overview of the chemicals sector, the key regulations that exporters or importers must comply with, and selected sources of further help and support.</p>

<p>The guide also includes information on dangerous, banned or restricted chemicals, their registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction under <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, and their disposal under waste regulations. </p>

<p>It provides information on how to research the destination countries you plan to export to and how to comply with regulations on hazard information, safety data sheets and dangerous goods notes.</p>

<h2 id="export-regulations-in-the-chemicals-sector">Export regulations in the chemicals sector</h2>

<p>Regulations, charges or other restrictions may apply to chemicals exports as they leave the UK and when they arrive at their destination country. It is important that you research both sides of the transaction.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu">Exporting your goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to a third country.</a></p>

<p>First, you need to classify your goods. Use of standardised classification codes makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply. You can use the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff) to classify your goods.</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with the Tariff, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a>. If you are new to the Tariff, see the section on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/finding-commodity-codes">classification rules</a> and using the tariff.</p>

<p>Generally, it’s simpler to trade with other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries than with countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> because the goods are in free circulation. The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is a single market and the UK is in a customs union so you can trade with other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries without restriction - although some local charges and licensing requirements may still apply.</p>

<p>For information on sector-specific export rules and procedures, see the pages in this guide on ‘Export regulations for dangerous, banned and restricted chemicals’ and ‘Classifying, packaging and labelling requirements for chemicals’. You can also read about the rules for transporting hazardous products in the guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-dangerous-goods">moving dangerous goods.</a></p>

<h3 id="export-licensing-and-certification">Export licensing and certification</h3>

<p>An export licence is required to export specific goods with military or potential military uses. To find out more about strategic export controls, see our section on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/about-the-export-control-organisation">Export Control Organisation.</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/export-control-organisation/eco-training-skills-academy/eco-films">Watch a video about your export control responsibilities and how you can ensure you have the correct licences on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<p>An export licence issued by the Home Office is required for precursor chemicals. Exports to some markets may require a Certificate of Free Sale, which states that the goods can be lawfully sold in the UK if they meet the relevant statutory requirements. For chemicals and detergents, this can be obtained from the Import Licensing Branch of <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>. You can call their helpline on 01642 364 333 or email them at <a href="mailto:CFS.enquiries@berr.gsi.gov.uk">CFS.enquiries@berr.gsi.gov.uk.</a></p>

<p>Exports are permitted for ozone-depleting chemicals (ODS), subject to an export authorisation issued by the European Commission. You can also find out how to apply to export ODS on the Europa website.</p>

<p>For information on export licences, read our guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">Do you need an export or import licence?</a></p>

<h3 id="exporting-goods-for-processing">Exporting goods for processing</h3>

<p>You may be able to obtain customs duty relief when re-importing <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> goods previously exported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for processing. Outward Processing Relief (<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>) enables you to claim relief from customs duty if you can show that the exported goods were used in, or are incorporated into, the products being imported. Before you can claim duty relief under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>, however, you must have the appropriate authorisation. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000225#P20_925">Read notice 235 on <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) website.</a> and see our guide on customs procedures</p>

<h2 id="export-regulations-for-dangerous-banned-and-restricted-chemicals">Export regulations for dangerous, banned and restricted chemicals</h2>

<p>If you export dangerous, banned or restricted chemicals, be aware of specific rules and procedures.</p>

<h3 id="safety-data-sheets">Safety data sheets</h3>

<p>If you produce or trade in dangerous chemicals you must provide accurate safety data sheets with all consignments, detailing the hazards posed. When sending chemicals to others for the first time you must also provide safety data sheets containing enough information to ensure the chemicals are used safely. If the sheet is updated you must send a copy to recipients of the chemical within the last year.</p>

<p>It’s your responsibility to ensure that the sheet is accurate.</p>

<p>Safety data sheets aren’t needed when:</p>

<ul>
<li>medicines and cosmetics are covered by other legislation and have different rules for packaging and labelling</li>
  <li>you’re a retailer and you’re supplying goods to the general public</li>
</ul>
<p>Safety data sheets are covered by the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>) Regulation, as amended, and not as previously by <abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr> 4 regulations. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/reachsds.pdf">download the <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> information leaflet on safety data sheets from the Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website (PDF, 158KB).</a></p>

<p>In addition, safety data sheets for substances must be revised so as to include classification and labelling information. For more information on the <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> amendments, you can <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:133:0001:0043:en:PDF">download Commission Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 453/2010 from the Europa website (PDF, 1.07MB).</a> Safety data sheets for mixtures will only have to undergo parallel change as of 1 June 2015. However, you can introduce the changes now if you prefer to do so.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/index.htm">find the latest <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> news and resources or subscribe to updates on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>The Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (<abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr>) implementing Directive (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, adopts the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of chemicals in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. It will take over some of the provisions of <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> and gradually replace the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009. For more information on <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr>, see the page in this guide on classifying, packaging and labelling requirements for chemicals.</p>

<h3 id="dangerous-goods-notes">Dangerous goods notes</h3>

<p>When dangerous goods such as hazardous chemicals are transported, the consignment must be accompanied by a dangerous goods note. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-dangerous-goods">Moving dangerous goods.</a></p>

<h3 id="banned-or-restricted-chemicals">Banned or restricted chemicals</h3>

<p>Under the Prior Informed Consent (<abbr title="Prior Informed Consent">PIC</abbr>) system, if you export certain banned or restricted chemicals, you must provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>notification to <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> at least 30 days prior to export of all chemicals listed in Annex 1 to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, which listings were amended in late January 2010 by Commission Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 15/2010</li>
  <li>assurances that chemicals are exported at least six months before their expiry date</li>
  <li>packaging and labelling to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> standards, whether you’re importing within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or beyond</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://edexim.jrc.it/">Find a list of chemicals subject to Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 on the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre website</a> or you can <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:006:0001:0005:EN:PDF">download Commission Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No. 15/2010 from the Europa website (PDF, 742KB).</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> sends the information to the European Commission, which allocates a unique reference number to the chemical you have exported. <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> then sends you a confirmation by fax, which must be included in documents for all subsequent exports of that chemical during the calendar year.</p>

<p>Exports are permitted for ozone-depleting chemicals (ODS) subject to an export authorisation issued by the European Commission. You can also <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/ods_export.htm">find out how to apply to export ODS on the Europa website.</a></p>

<p>Certain chemicals with potential military applications may be defined as dual-use goods and subject to licensing, restrictions or banning controls. For more information, see the guide on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/about-the-export-control-organisation">Export Control Organisation.</a></p>

<p>There are regulations relating to dual use chemicals which are covered by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) Schedules of Chemicals.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/nuclear/nonprolif/chemical_bio/cwc_uk_auth/cwc_uk_auth.aspx">Read about the regulations relating to the CWC on the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change (<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h2 id="classifying-packaging-and-labelling-requirements-for-chemicals">Classifying, packaging and labelling requirements for chemicals</h2>

<p>When exporting, you must package and label chemicals as you would for supply within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. However, the labels should preferably be in the language of the importing country. You must also comply with any other requirements specified by the importing country.</p>

<p>For chemicals, the general principles of classification and labelling for supply are explained by the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009 (<abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr>) and the Classifying, Labelling and Packaging Regulation. <a rel="external" href="http://books.hse.gov.uk/hse/public/saleproduct.jsf?catalogueCode=9780717663705">Read a copy of the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> Approved Classification and Labelling Guide.</a> However, <abbr title="Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009">CHIP</abbr> is in the process of being phased out.</p>

<p>If, under the <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> regulations you manufacture or import more than one tonne of a chemical substance per year, you must register it with the European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>) (unless it was pre-registered before 1 December 2008).</p>

<p>This relates to chemicals on their own, in a preparation (mixture) of substances, or in an article (manufactured goods) from which it is intended to be released.</p>

<p>If you fail to register, you will not be allowed to manufacture or import the substance concerned.</p>

<p><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> is the UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/index.htm">find out about <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="the-classifying-labelling-and-packaging-regulation">The Classifying, Labelling and Packaging Regulation</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> applies directly in all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.  It is changing requirements for manufacturers and importers of chemicals who must classify and label chemicals according to their health, physical and environmental hazards, based on the United Nations (UN)-agreed Globally Harmonised System.</p>

<p>The Regulation introduces new classification criteria for hazardous substances and mixtures, ie substances and mixtures subject to <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, together with changed hazard pictograms and hazard and precautionary statements for labels. </p>

<p>The following substances must be notified to the Classification &amp; Labelling (C&amp;L) Inventory of European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Substances which are subject to registration under <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> (≥ 1 tonne/year) and placed on the market. This will include substances on their own, substances contained in mixtures and certain substances contained in articles where <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> Article 7 provides for their registration. Notification of these substances is not necessary where a manufacturer, importer or Only Representative has already registered the substance with the classification and labelling according to <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> when its notification in line with <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> Article 40(1) is due.</li>
  <li>Substances classified as hazardous under <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> and placed on the market irrespective of the tonnage. This includes substances which are classified as hazardous under <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr>, but which are exempted from registration, e.g. polymers referred to in <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> Article 6(3).</li>
  <li>Substances classified as hazardous under <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> and present in a mixture above the concentration limits specified in Annex I of <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> or as specified in Directive 1999/45/EC, where relevant, which results in the classification of the mixture as hazardous, and where the mixture is placed on the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/17235/pg_7_clp_notif_en.pdf">download guidance how to notify substances in the Classification and Labelling Inventory from the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> website (PDF, 182KB).</a></p>

<p>Any substances placed on the market on 1 December 2010 must be notified on or before 3 January 2011 to the Classification &amp; Labelling (C&amp;L) Inventory of <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>. However, not all manufacturers need to themselves register substances. Any business with a pre-registered substance under <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, must belong to a Substance Information Exchange Forum (<abbr title="Substance Information Exchange Forum">SIEF</abbr>) comprising members with the same substance pre-registered. Note that the UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority is not involved in the operation of SIEFs. You can <a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp">find more information on SIEFs on the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You must use <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> to classify, label and package substances, including chemical elements such as arsenic or compounds such as acetone. <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> became mandatory on 1 December 2010 for substances and will be mandatory on 1 June 2015 for mixtures, but suppliers may classify and label according to the new system straight away.</p>

<p><abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> applies to you if you manufacture, import, use or distribute chemical substances or mixtures. You must classify, label and package any substance or mixture, regardless of its annual tonnage, in accordance with the <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> Regulation before you place it on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market. Placing on the market of a substance or mixture means making it physically available to third parties, whether in return for payment or free of charge.</p>

<p>If you are a manufacturer or importer, you are required under <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> to classify substances that are subject to registration or to notification in line with Article 7 or 9 of <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>, even if you do not place them on the market. This includes, for example, the classification of substances that are used for product and process-orientated research and development (PPORD).</p>

<p>If you are a manufacturer or importer you must notify hazardous substances that you place on the market on their own or contained in hazardous mixtures above certain applicable concentration limits, regardless of the annual tonnage manufactured or imported, as well as substances subject to registration under <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> and that you place on the market, to the Classification &amp; Labelling Inventory established at the Agency.</p>

<p>If any of the above applies to your business, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/ghs/eureg.htm">find guidance on the <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> Regulation on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/clp/clp_regulation_en.asp">read about your wider C&amp;L and <abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation">CLP</abbr> duties and how they fit in with <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> on the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="researching-your-export-destination-in-the-chemicals-sector">Researching your export destination in the chemicals sector</h2>

<p>You should thoroughly research your export destination country when planning to export.</p>

<p>There are a number of issues that you ought to consider. As a starting point, you may wish to seek advice from <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/unitedkingdom/contactus.html">Find your local international trade team on the <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> website.</a> There’s also a <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> National Chemical Sector base at Wilton, near Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>As well as considering the business pros and cons when you research a potential export destination, you will need to check whether: </p>

<ul>
<li>your goods are affected by restrictions and/or licensing requirements</li>
  <li>duties and/or taxes will be charged in the destination country</li>
  <li>there any bans or quotas in place for your type of product</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various ways you can research a potential export destination:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/sectors/chemicals.html">find chemical sector business opportunities and trade events listings on the UK Trade &amp; Investment (<abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr>) website</a></li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/countries.html">find country listings including trade relations status and economic forecasts on the <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> website</a> </li>
  <li>trade associations can also offer help - see the page in this guide on sources of help and support in the chemicals sector</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider product safety and other technical standards in your export market. Your goods may need to be adapted to comply with these standards. Rules in your export market may be less or more strict than in the UK.</p>

<p>For a general guide to market information on sectors and countries, see the guide on researching and entering overseas markets and for general information on exporting, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/imports-exports">importing and exporting basics</a>.</p>

<p>You can also ask for information about your export destination country from a range of organisations, including:
* your local <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> trade team
* your <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> team within the commercial section of the UK embassy in your destination country
* chemicals sector trade associations
* the Chambers of Commerce in the UK and in your destination country</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> is a government organisation that supports UK businesses trading internationally and overseas enterprises seeking to set up or expand in the UK. <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> has an impartial global presence in countries throughout the world and helps businesses realise their international potential through knowledge transfer and ongoing partnership support.</p>

<h2 id="tariffs-and-duties-in-the-chemicals-sector">Tariffs and duties in the chemicals sector</h2>

<p>All businesses in this sector must comply with a range of import- and/or export-specific regulations. The key issues relate to the Tariff, duties and Intrastat. Also see the page in this guide on import regulations in the chemicals sector.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-integrated-tariff">Using the Integrated Tariff</h3>

<p>A common customs tariff is applied across all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on goods imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can use the Tariff to determine the specific classification code of your goods and to find:</p>

<ul>
<li>any licensing requirements that apply</li>
  <li>the rates of duty and import VAT that apply</li>
  <li>any additional charges, such as anti-dumping duties</li>
  <li>any available preferential duty rates</li>
</ul>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are already familiar with the UK Trade Tariff, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff.</a></p>
</div>

<p>If you are new to the Tariff, see the section on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/finding-commodity-codes">classification rules and using the tariff</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preferential-duty-rates">Preferential duty rates</h3>

<p>The Generalised System of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>) allows originating products from a wide range of countries to be imported into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> at a reduced or zero duty rate. You can find more information on the page on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/importing-and-exporting-using-international-trade-preferences">Generalised System of Preferences and <abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>+. </a></p>

<p>For more information on how to determine whether a product is an originating one, <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_030799#P19_929">read Notice 830 - Tariff Preference: New <abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr> rules of origin on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>The European Community (EC) has a number of other trade agreements with third countries and regional trading blocs, as a result of which goods may attract preferential rates of duty. You can find more information in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/rules-of-origin">rules of origin.</a></p>

<h3 id="intrastat">Intrastat</h3>

<p>If you are VAT-registered and the goods you acquire from or supply to VAT-registered businesses in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries reach the Intrastat exemption threshold for the year, you must submit monthly supplementary declarations to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. The 2012 thresholds are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>Intrastat is the method of collecting information and producing statistics on goods traded between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states. See our guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/introduction-to-intrastat">Intrastat - reporting the value and volume of intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade.</a> Intrastat is only applicable to VAT-registered traders.</p>

<h2 id="import-regulations-in-the-chemicals-sector">Import regulations in the chemicals sector</h2>

<p>As the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is a customs union you can buy most goods from other member countries without restrictions - although VAT and excise duty can still apply. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/trading-in-the-eu">trading in the European Union.</a> You can also see the page about VAT on goods from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries in the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/imports/importing.htm">imports and purchases from abroad: paying and reclaiming VAT.</a>.</p>

<p>If you import from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you may have to comply with import licensing requirements and with common customs tariffs that apply across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For more information, see our guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/importing-goods-from-outside-the-eu">importing your goods from outside the European Union.</a></p>

<h3 id="import-licences-and-restrictions">Import licences and restrictions</h3>

<p>Import restrictions can be product-specific or trade-specific. Many products are subject to product-specific standards and need to be supported by applicable certificates, product-specific licences and documentation.</p>

<p>If you wish to import any of the 12 category 1 drug precursor chemicals you must be licensed by the Home Office. This category includes raw opium, coca leaves, crude drugs and preparations.</p>

<p>To apply for an import or export licence for a specific consignment of controlled drugs, you will need to hold a domestic licence for that type of drug, complete the appropriate application form, and email it as a Word attachment to <a href="mailto:import_export_druglicences@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">import_export_druglicences@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If your company holds a blanket export licence, you must complete an export declaration form immediately following each shipment.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/import-export/">find import and export licence application information on the Home Office website.</a></p>

<p>Quite separately, quantitative restrictions or limitations and anti-dumping duties may apply to certain imported commodities. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/anti-dumping-duty-to-protect-eu-businesses-against-cheap-imports">anti-dumping and countervailing duties.</a> You can check the Tariff to see if an import licence is required.</p>

<p>Use the Tariff for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/finding-commodity-codes">classifying your goods</a> in order to find out which duties and measures apply. </p>

<h3 id="alcohol-and-excise-duties">Alcohol and excise duties</h3>

<p>Excise duties are payable on alcohols imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. However, spirits that have been made unsuitable for human consumption by the addition of denaturants can qualify for relief. The goods should be entered on the Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>), form C88. For more information, see the page on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/declarations-and-the-single-administrative-document">using the Single Administrative Document for imports and exports.</a> To find out about classification of goods, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/finding-commodity-codes">classification of goods.</a></p>
