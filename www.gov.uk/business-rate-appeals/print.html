  </header><p>The rates you pay on your business property depend on its ‘rateable value’. This is calculated by the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>).  </p>

<p>If you think the current value for your property is wrong you can: </p>

<ul>
<li>appeal to the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> and ask them to correct the details you think are wrong</li>
  <li>appeal your rates if you and the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> can’t agree (you do this through the <a href="/business-rate-appeals/the-valuation-tribunal" title="the Valuation Tribunal">Valuation Tribunal</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must continue to pay your rates during the appeal.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This information applies to England and Wales only - appeals are handled differently in <a href="http://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/businessratesappeals" title="business rates appeals in Northern Ireland" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a> and <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/17999/11199/brief-guide/valuationappeal" title="business rates appeals in Scotland" rel="external">Scotland.</a></p>
</div>


</article><article id="before-you-appeal"><header><h1>Part 2: Before you appeal</h1>
  </header><p>The first step in appealing your business rates is to ask the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) to check the details.  This can change how much you pay for your business rates.  </p>

<p>If you think your rateable value is wrong:  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.2010.voa.gov.uk/rli/en/basic/find" title="Check the details of your property">check the details</a> used to value your property</li>
  <li>make a <a rel="external" href="http://www.2010.voa.gov.uk" title="VOA website">valuation enquiry</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> will change your rateable value if it was wrong.  They may need to visit your property.</p>

<p>You can start an appeal with the Valuation Tribunal at any time.</p>

<h2>Material changes</h2>

<p>A material change is a physical change to part or all of your property. This can change its rateable value.</p>

<p>Material changes can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>changes to how the property is used</li>
  <li>new developments in the area</li>
  <li>changes to access routes or footpaths to the area</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> becomes aware of a material change, they’ll look at how it affects the rental value and whether this means the rateable value needs to be adjusted.</p>

<h2>Extreme flooding</h2>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/contact/index.html" title="find your local VOA office">tell the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr></a> immediately if extreme flooding is affecting the use of your property. There might be a reduction in your business rates.</p>


</article><article id="types-of-appeals"><header><h1>Part 3: Types of appeals</h1>
  </header><h2>Valuation appeals</h2>

<p>If you disagree with the rateable value set at <a href="/introduction-to-business-rates/revaluation" title="revaluation">revaluation</a>, you can appeal against it. </p>

<p>You must still pay your bill during the appeal.  </p>

<h3>Grounds for appeal</h3>

<p>Grounds to appeal include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the valuation was wrong  </li>
  <li>there has been a change to the property or area that should be shown in the rateable value  </li>
  <li>a change made to the valuation by the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) is wrong  </li>
</ul>
<p>All the grounds fall into one of <a rel="external" href="http://www.2010.voa.gov.uk/rli/static/HelpPages/English/faqs/faq100-grounds_of_appeal.html" title="Valuation Office Agency - on what grounds can I appeal">12 categories.</a> You can only appeal once on each of these.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>If your rateable value is altered, you can appeal once against it.</p>
</div>

<p>The rateable value is set every 5 years. This was last done on 1 April 2010.</p>

<h2>Penalty notice appeals</h2>

<p>You can get a penalty notice if you don’t give the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> information they’ve asked you for to set their rateable value. If you get a penalty notice, you can appeal against it. </p>

<p>If you appeal, you don’t have to pay the penalty until after the appeal tribunal has made a decision. However, you may get more penalties during the appeals process.</p>

<h2>Completion notice appeals</h2>

<p>Your local council will give you one of these when it thinks that a new property:</p>

<ul>
<li>is finished</li>
  <li>can be finished by a certain date</li>
</ul>
<p>This means you must start paying business rates on the property once the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> has added it to the ratings list (the list of all rateable values for non-domestic properties).  </p>

<p>If you get a completion notice, you can appeal against it if you don’t agree.</p>

<h2>Transitional certificate appeals</h2>

<p>A transitional certificate is given when a valuation officer knows there is something wrong with the ratings list but can’t fix it. </p>

<p>The certificate is given to show the correct amount in your business rates bill. You can appeal against the value of the transitional certificate but not against being given one.</p>

</article><article id="the-valuation-tribunal"><header><h1>Part 5: The Valuation Tribunal</h1>
  </header><p>The Valuation Tribunal is a free service but you have to pay for your own costs, eg legal help, travel.</p>

<h2>Before the hearing</h2>

<p>You’ll be given between 4 and 10 weeks’ notice of your hearing date. If your case is urgent, your hearing can be earlier.  </p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>appoint someone to argue for you at the tribunal - but you must let the Valuation Tribunal know</li>
  <li>bring a witness to the tribunal</li>
  <li>present any relevant evidence to the tribunal - including anything discussed between you and the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should bring 5 copies of any documents you will give as evidence.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> must send you their evidence 6 weeks before the hearing. You have to submit your evidence to the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> and the tribunal 4 weeks before the hearing.</p>

<h2>What happens at the tribunal</h2>

<p>The hearing usually lasts about 45 minutes. The panel will decide who will present first.</p>

<p>You and the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> will present your cases and you, the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> and the panel can all ask questions.</p>

<p>You may then be able to sum up your case before the panel makes a decision.</p>

<p>Tribunals are open to the public.</p>

<p>There is further guidance about the process on the  <a rel="external" href="http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/Attending_a_Hearing/PracticeStatements.aspx" title="Valuation Tribunal website">Valuation Tribunal website.</a></p>

<h3>A hearing in your absence</h3>
