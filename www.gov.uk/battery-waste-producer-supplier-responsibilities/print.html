  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>There are rules on how to manage your battery waste if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>sell or distribute batteries </li>
  <li>produce batteries (and products that contain batteries)</li>
  <li>import batteries (products that contain batteries) for sale in the UK</li>
  <li>recycle batteries (this includes collection, treatment, export)</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules are different for portable, industrial and vehicle batteries.</p>

</article><article id="battery-retailers-and-distributors"><header><h1>Part 2: Battery retailers and distributors</h1>
  </header><h2>Portable batteries</h2>

<p>If you sell or supply 32 kilograms or more of portable batteries a year you must take back waste batteries from customers free of charge. This rule applies if you run a shop, a chain or sell batteries via distance selling.</p>

<p>One pack of 4 AA batteries per day equals about 32 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> per year. Search for battery weight calculators online.</p>

<p>You must provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>a free collection point for all kinds of portable batteries, not only the types you sell</li>
  <li>information to customers about collection, eg a poster in your shop</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sending batteries to be recycled</h3>

<p>It’s not essential, but you can ask a battery compliance scheme to collect your batteries free of charge - search online to join one or call the Environment Agency to get advice on joining a scheme.</p>

<p>To transport batteries yourself, eg to a recycling plant, you need a licence and have to follow the law on  <a href="/dispose-hazardous-waste" title="dispose of hazardous waste">hazardous waste</a>.</p>

<p>Vehicle Certification Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>) officers can visit your premises to make sure you are complying with the law.</p>

<h3>Smaller retailers</h3>
<p>Retailers selling fewer than 32 <abbr title="kilogram">kg</abbr> don’t have to run a take-back scheme. If you decide to take waste batteries back you may have to arrange collection and transport for recycling yourself and follow the law on <a href="/dispose-hazardous-waste" title="dispose of hazardous waste">hazardous waste</a>. Speak to a compliance scheme operator first - they may offer a collection.</p>

  </header><h2>Portable batteries</h2>

<p>The regulations for collection, treatment and recycling depend on the amount of batteries you put on the market.</p>

<h3>1 tonne or more per year</h3>
<p>You must pay for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of waste batteries. You do this by joining a <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/111038.aspx" title="Battery Compliance Scheme">Battery Compliance Scheme.</a></p>

<p>They will:</p>

<ul>
<li>register you with the Environment Agency (<abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>collect, treat and recycle waste batteries</li>
  <li>send information to the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> about the collection to recycling process</li>
</ul>
<h3>Less than 1 tonne per year</h3>
<p>You must register directly with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/111042.aspx" title="Environment Agency">Environment Agency.</a></p>

<p>You can join a Battery Compliance Scheme to dispose of your waste batteries.</p>

<p>If you’re starting a new battery business you must register within 28 days of putting batteries on the market.</p>

<h3>Producers of industrial and vehicle batteries</h3>
<p>You must <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/111046.aspx" title="register with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">register with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>).</a> </p>

<p>You have to take back any waste batteries your customers bring you, whether they bought them from you or not. Producers of vehicle batteries don’t have to take batteries from consumers, just from garages, scrap yards, end of life vehicle treatment sites and civic amenity sites.</p>

<p>You must tell customers how they can return waste batteries, eg on your website.</p>


</article><article id="treating-and-recycling-waste-batteries"><header><h1>Part 4: Treating and recycling waste batteries</h1>
  </header><p>You must apply for an <a href="/get-an-environmental-permit" title="Get an environmental permit">environmental permit</a> to treat or recycle portable batteries. </p>

<p>For industrial and car batteries you must apply to the Environment Agency (Scottish Environment Protection Agency or Northern Ireland Environment Agency) to be an <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/111050.aspx" title="approved battery treatment operator">approved battery treatment operator.</a></p>
