  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="fixedterm-contract-rights"><header><h1>Part 1: Fixed-term contract rights</h1>
  </header><p>You’re a fixed-term employee if both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have an employment contract with the organisation you work for</li>
  <li>your contract ends on a particular date - or on completion of a specific task, eg a project</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re not a fixed-term employee if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have a contract with an agency rather than the company you’re working for</li>
  <li>you’re a student or trainee on a work-experience placement</li>
  <li>you’re working under a ‘contract of apprenticeship’</li>
  <li>you’re a member of the armed forces  </li>
</ul>
<p>You may be a fixed-term employee if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>a seasonal or casual employee taken on for 6 months during a peak period</li>
  <li>a specialist employee for a project</li>
  <li>cover for maternity leave  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Your rights</h2>

<p>Your employer must not treat you less favourably than a permanent employee doing the same or largely the same job, unless there is good reason to do so.</p>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the same pay and conditions</li>
  <li>the same or equivalent benefits package</li>
  <li>be told about permanent vacancies in the organisation</li>
  <li>protection against redundancy or <a href="/dismissal" title="Dismissals">dismissal</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve worked continually for the same employer for 2 years or more, you have the same <a href="/redundant-your-rights" title="Redundancy">redundancy rights</a> as a permanent employee.</p>

<p>You cannot compare conditions with someone at an associated employer’s organisation.</p>

<h2>When you can be treated differently</h2>
<p>There are some situations when your employer doesn’t have to treat you in the same way as a permanent employee. Your employer must be able to show there is a good reason to - this is called ‘objective justification’.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If you have a 3-month contract and a permanent employee doing the same kind of job has a company car, it may not be fair to expect your employer to offer you a company car for such a short period.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you think you’re not being treated fairly</h2>
<p>If you have a concern, try and sort it out with your manager. You can ask your employer for a written statement explaining why they’re treating you less favourably.</p>

<p>If you’re not satisfied, you can complain using your employer’s <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="Solve a workplace dispute">grievance procedure</a>.</p>

<p>You final option is to make a claim to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment tribunal">employment tribunal</a>.</p>


</article><article id="renewing-or-ending-a-fixedterm-contract"><header><h1>Part 2: Renewing or ending a fixed-term contract</h1>
  </header><h2>Ending a fixed-term contact</h2>
<p>Your fixed-term contract will normally end automatically when it reaches the agreed end date. Your employer doesn’t have to give you notice.</p>

<h2>If your contract is not renewed</h2>

<p>If your fixed-term contact isn’t renewed, it’s considered to be a dismissal. In this situation your employer needs to show that there’s a ‘fair’ reason for not renewing your contract, eg they’re planning to stop doing the work you were employed to do.  </p>

<p>You’ve the right:</p>

<ul>
<li>not to be unfairly dismissed after 2 years’ service (for employees who were in employment before 6 April 2012, it’s 1 year’s service)  </li>
  <li>to a written statement of reasons for not renewing the contract - after 1 year’s service</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be entitled to statutory redundancy payments after 2 years’ service if your work ends unexpectedly.</p>

<h2>If your employer wants to end your contract earlier</h2>
<p>If your employer wants to end your fixed-term contract early, you should check the terms of your contract. If: </p>

<ul>
<li>it says nothing about being ended early, your employer may be in breach of contract</li>
  <li>it says it can be ended early, and your employer has given proper notice, there’s little you can do  </li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum notice period you’re entitled to is:</p>

<ul>
<li>after 1 month’s continuous service, but less than 2 years - 1 week</li>
  <li>after 2 years’ continuous employment - 1 week for each year you’ve worked </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>These are the minimum periods - your contract may give you the right to a longer notice period.</p>
</div>

<p>If your employer ends your contract without giving you the proper notice, you may be able to claim <a href="/dismissal" title="Dismissal">breach of contract</a>.</p>

<h2>Working longer than the contract’s end date</h2>
<p>If you work past the end of your contract without it being formally renewed, there’s an ‘implied agreement’ by your employer that the end date has changed.</p>

<p>You would then have the right to be given proper notice if your employer wanted to dismiss you.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If your contract was for 1 month or less but you were actually employed for 3 months, you’d be entitled to the minimum notice period (1 week).</p>
</div>

<h2>The limit on renewing a fixed-term contract</h2>
<p>You can be kept on successive fixed-term contracts for limit of 4 years.</p>

<p>If it’s renewed after that, you’ll become a permanent employee unless your employer can show a good reason why you should stay on a fixed-term contract.</p>

<p>You can work for longer than 4 years on fixed-term contracts if it has been agreed by both the employer and employees agreeing a workforce or ‘collective agreement’.</p>

<h2>Your employer wants to renew a fixed-term contract on less favourable terms</h2>

<p>If you employer wants to renew your fixed-term contract on less favourable terms you can negotiate with them to reach an agreement. </p>

<p>If the contract ends and you have been unable to agree to the less favourable terms of a new contract, you may be able to claim <a href="/dismissal" title="Dismissal">unfair dismissal</a>.</p>

<h2>Ending your contract early</h2>
<p>You must give 1 week’s notice if you’ve worked for your employer for a month or more. Your contract may state that you need to give longer notice.</p>
