<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>With large numbers of goods vehicles from many different countries on the roads, international road traffic is subject to a wide range of international and national laws and regulations. There is a series of Conventions and Agreements made between countries, governing the way vehicles operate in cross-border transport. Together these laws and regulations, Conventions and Agreements provide your business with the basic conditions for operating heavy goods vehicles abroad. They cover road transport safety, security and environmental protection and the issues surrounding the development of international trade.</p>

<p>This guide explains the impact of the key issues on your road transport business and what you need to do to comply with the requirements and regulations.</p>

<h2 id="the-vehicle-and-driver-documentation-you-will-need-when-driving-abroad">The vehicle and driver documentation you will need when driving abroad</h2>

<p>Vehicles must meet technical and regulatory requirements to be legal for use on the roads in the country in which they are registered.</p>

<p>If you or a member of your staff drives any vehicle on roads of another country, the technical requirements of the country where the vehicle is driven do not generally apply where they conflict - eg, whether a vehicle is left-hand or right-hand drive. However, you may have to display a sign indicating that your vehicle is different to those on the road.</p>

<p>You should check local regulations for other variations, eg some countries require you to carry warning triangles, reflective jackets, fire extinguishers, first aid kits and/or snow chains for use in case of roadside incidents. You should also check that your insurance is recognised and suitable for all countries on your planned route. You can check local regulations by contacting the British embassies of the countries through which you are driving. <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/embassies-and-posts/find-an-embassy-overseas/">Find embassy contact details on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>A UK-registered lorry, coach or bus must have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>current vehicle tax disc</li>
  <li>vehicle registration certificate (V5C) or plating/replating certificate as appropriate - if the vehicle is rented or leased, you should be given a photocopy of the relevant forms</li>
  <li>valid insurance certificate or cover note</li>
  <li>valid MOT, passenger service vehicle or goods vehicle test certificate if appropriate</li>
  <li>valid reduced pollution certificate - if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic has general rules about vehicle drivers. These include the requirement that they must have passed the appropriate driving test and carry a valid driving licence. The Convention also lays down rules for safe driving, such as speeds, distance between vehicles, priorities at junctions, overtaking, etc.</p>

<p>When driving outside of the UK, you should make sure that you or your drivers carry either originals or certified copies of all relevant documents. </p>

<p>For specific information on each country on your itinerary, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country">search for road travel, driver, vehicle and documentation requirements on the <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Note: Do not laminate or otherwise change copies or documents.</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-weight-limits-when-driving-abroad">Vehicle weight limits when driving abroad</h2>

<p>The maximum gross train weight (known as the maximum plated weight) for UK-registered articulated tractor/trailer or rigid vehicles is 44,000 kilograms. This covers three-axle articulated tractors and rigid vehicles with three or more axles. In both cases, the vehicles must be fitted with Euro 2 engines as a minimum standard. Vehicles registered before 1 October 1997 may have engines that can be upgraded to Euro 2 standard.</p>

<h3 id="gross-plated-weights">Gross plated weights</h3>

<p>The gross plated weight is the total permitted weight of a loaded vehicle. When operating at this capacity, the drive-axle weight must be no more than 10,500 kilograms. Road-friendly suspension is required if the rear-axle weights exceed 8,500 kilograms. Trailers must have at least three axles and must be fitted with road-friendly suspension. This must have a distance of at least 8 metres between the coupling centre and the centre of the rearmost axle.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.roadsafe.com/magazine/2008spring/weigh.htm">Read about complying with vehicle weight regulations on the Roadsafe website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="green-plate">Green plate</h3>

<p>Vehicles with Euro 2 (or better) engines (either as original equipment or upgraded and re-plated) have a ‘green plate’ which is usually found in the driver’s cab or on the trailer headboard. The centre column on the green plate shows the weights that vehicles can operate at throughout the European Community (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>). For vehicles that are re-plated to the latest and amended regulations, the maximum <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> train weight is 40,000 kilograms.</p>

<p>Vehicles without Euro 2 engines have earlier gross train limits - 40,000 kilograms for two-axle vehicles and 41,000 kilograms for three-axle vehicles.</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-emission-levels-and-controls">Vehicle emission levels and controls</h2>

<p>All businesses have legal obligations to consider environmental issues, but being environmentally responsible can also have significant other benefits, improving your business reputation and improving staff morale. One increasingly important environmental requirement is the reduction of particle emissions in vehicle exhausts. This means that before a new vehicle can be approved for sale in the EU it must meet certain standards for exhaust emissions as specified by EU directives.</p>

<p>Standards for light duty vehicles (cars and vans) and heavy-duty vehicles (heavy goods vehicles and buses) are defined in separate EU Directives. Light duty standards are referred to using Arabic numerals (eg ‘Euro 4’) and heavy-duty standards using roman numerals (eg ‘Euro IV’). The current emission standard for new heavy-duty vehicles is Euro 5/Euro V. For light-duty vehicles, the emission standard currently in force is Euro 4. The EU Directives also define a non-binding standard called Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle. <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/road.htm">Read about the latest Euro standards for vehicle emissions on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>Euro standards are also used to establish whether heavy goods vehicles can be registered with a <a href="/specialist-tests-for-lorries/reduced-pollution-certificate-and-low-emissions-certificate-tests" title="Reduced Pollution Certificate and Low Emissions Certificate tests">Reduced Pollution Certificate (<abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>)</a>. An <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr> will significantly reduce vehicle tax, and permit entry of <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>-registered vehicles into low-emission areas such as the London Low Emission Zone.</p>

<p>If you own buses or heavy goods lorries, you can tax vehicles in one of a reduced-pollution tax class when producing a valid <abbr title="Reduced Pollution Certificate">RPC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="road-consignment-notes">Road consignment notes</h2>

<p>If you want to use a provider to transport goods internationally by road, there is a standard contract you should use. This is a road consignment note - known as the <abbr title="road consignment note">CMR</abbr> note - which confirms that the haulage company has received the goods and has a contract from the supplier to carry them.</p>

<p>On all international journeys - ie other than between the UK and the Republic of Ireland - a haulier must have a <abbr title="road consignment note">CMR</abbr> note if carrying goods on a commercial basis.</p>

<h3 id="completing-a-cmr-note">Completing a <abbr title="road consignment note">CMR</abbr> note</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="road consignment note">CMR</abbr> note can be filled out by the company sending the goods abroad, the haulier or by a freight forwarder, but must contain prescribed information.</p>

<p>You will need three copies of a <abbr title="road consignment note">CMR</abbr> note, including one:</p>

<ul>
<li>for the supplier of the goods</li>
  <li>for the eventual customer</li>
  <li>to accompany the goods while they are being transported</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy pre-printed pads of <abbr title="road consignment note">CMR</abbr> notes from Road Haulage Association (<abbr title="Road Haulage Association">RHA</abbr>) and the Freight Transport Association (<abbr title="Freight Transport Association">FTA</abbr>).</p>

<p>For more information on how to complete and carry the <abbr title="road consignment note">CMR</abbr>, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-goods-by-road">moving goods by road</a>. </p>

<h2 id="restrictions-on-driving-commercial-vehicles-in-europe">Restrictions on driving commercial vehicles in Europe</h2>

<p>If your business involves transporter vehicles abroad, it is worth bearing in mind that several European Union countries impose restrictions on the times and days when heavy goods vehicles can be driven on public roads. However, there is no general European standard. There is a wide variation in how long the restrictions last, when they start and finish, the types of vehicle covered and exemptions from the restrictions.</p>

<p>France, Spain and Italy have a general ban on the movement of vehicles with a maximum gross weight of 7.5 tonnes on Sundays and during public holidays. For detailed information on restrictions in France, Spain and Italy <a rel="external" href="http://www.bison-fute.equipement.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/2009_RPL_en_web_cle29555a.pdf">download a guide to European traffic restrictions from the Bison Fute website (PDF, 668K)</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to general restrictions and bans, some countries have limitations on specific roads and types of road during certain times of the year. For example, certain Alpine countries impose limited restrictions during winter months. For advice on whether restrictions will apply to your specific routes, you should contact your trade association or the British Embassy.</p>
