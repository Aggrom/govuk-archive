There is no specific number of hours that makes someone full or part-time, but a full-time worker will usually work 35 hours or more a week.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Part-time workers should get the same treatment for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/understanding-your-pay\" title=\"Understanding your pay\">pay rates</a> (including sick pay, maternity, paternity and adoption leave and pay)</li>\n  <li>pension opportunities and benefits</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/holiday-entitlement-your-rights\" title=\"Holiday entitlement your rights\">holidays</a></li>\n  <li>training and career development</li>\n  <li>selection for promotion and transfer, or for <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\" title=\"Redundancy: your rights\">redundancy</a></li>\n  <li>opportunities for career breaks   </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some benefits are applied &lsquo;pro rata&rsquo; (in proportion to hours worked).

In these situations the employer must be able to show there is a good reason to do so - this is called &lsquo;objective justification&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>An employer may provide health insurance for full-time employees but not part-timers if this can be objectively justified. </p>\n\n<p>Their reason may be that the costs involved are disproportionate to the benefits part-timers are entitled to. </p>\n\n<p>In this case the employer may come up with an alternative like asking the part-time worker to make a contribution to the extra cost.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>If a part-time worker&rsquo;s been treated less favourably</h2>\n\n<p>Part-time workers should first discuss this with their employer or trade union representative. </p>\n\n<p>They have the right to get a written statement of reasons for the treatment from their employer. The request should be in writing and the employer must write back within 21 days.</p>\n\n<p>If the worker isn&rsquo;t satisfied that the reason given was objectively justified, they may be able to take a case to an <a href=\"/employment-tribunals\" title=\"employment tribunals\">employment tribunal.</a></p>\n"}],["tags",[{"title":"Contracts of employment and working hours","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/employing-people%2Fcontracts.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes types of worker, employee rights, overtime and changes to contracts","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people%2Fcontracts","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people/contracts"},"parent":{"title":"Employing people","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/employing-people.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes pay, contracts and hiring","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[{"title":"Solve a workplace dispute","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/solve-workplace-dispute.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/solve-workplace-dispute","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"365","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"Joining a trade union","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/join-trade-union.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/join-trade-union","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"1905","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"Understanding your pay","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/understanding-your-pay.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/understanding-your-pay","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"1451","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"Holiday entitlement if you work irregular hours","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/holiday-entitlement-if-you-work-irregular-hours.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-if-you-work-irregular-hours","format":"answer","details":{"need_id":"2098","business_proposition":false}}]]],"parts":null}
