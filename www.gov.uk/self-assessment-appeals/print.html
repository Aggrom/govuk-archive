  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="appeal-against-a-penalty"><header><h1>Part 1: Appeal against a penalty</h1>
  </header><p>You may be <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns/penalties" title="Self Assessment penalties">charged a penalty</a> if, for example, you’ve missed the tax return or payment deadline.</p>

<p>You can appeal against the penalty if you’ve got a ‘reasonable excuse’ for being late.</p>

<h2>What may be a reasonable excuse</h2>

<p>A reasonable excuse is something unexpected or unusual and outside your control that prevented you from sending your tax return or payment on time, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>your partner died shortly before the tax return or payment deadline</li>
  <li>you had a serious or life-threatening illness (eg a heart attack) that prevented you from dealing with your tax affairs</li>
  <li>you lost important documents in a fire that couldn’t be replaced in time to complete your tax return</li>
  <li>postal delays that you couldn’t have predicted</li>
  <li>you registered for the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) online service before the tax return deadline but didn’t get your activation code or user ID in time</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s unlikely to be a reasonable excuse</h2>

<p>The following aren’t usually accepted as a reasonable excuse:</p>

<ul>
<li>you relied on someone else to send your return and they didn’t</li>
  <li>your cheque bounced or payment failed because you didn’t have enough money</li>
  <li>you didn’t get a reminder from <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you registered for the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> online service after the tax return deadline</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to appeal</h2>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=3ScvEs7_4vk&amp;formId=6706" title="Self Assessment appeal form">fill in an appeal form</a> explaining the problem as soon as you know your return or payment are late.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> sends you a penalty letter, you can use the appeal form that comes with it.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Only the nominated partner can appeal against penalties for sending partnership tax returns late.</p>
</div>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must appeal within 30 days of the date on a penalty letter from <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you appeal later, <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will look at the information you give them and decide if they will consider your appeal.</p>


</article><article id="appeal-against-a-tax-bill"><header><h1>Part 2: Appeal against a tax bill</h1>
  </header><h2>If your tax bill is wrong</h2>

<p>If you think your tax bill is wrong because you made a mistake on your tax return you don’t need to appeal - you may be able to <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns/corrections" title="Correcting Self Assessment tax returns">correct it</a>. You’ll get a new tax bill if you correct your return.</p>

<h2>If you’ve been sent a tax bill because you didn’t send a tax return</h2>

<p>If HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) has estimated the bill because you didn’t send a tax return, you can’t appeal against it. You must <a href="/file-your-self-assessment-tax-return" title="Send your Self Assessment tax return online">send your tax return</a>. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will send you a new tax bill when you’ve sent your tax return.</p>

<h2>If <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> has amended your tax bill</h2>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> have changed the amount you owe after a check on your return and you disagree with it, you can appeal against it.</p>

<p>You have 30 days from the date of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s letter to you (usually a tax assessment or penalty notice) to appeal.</p>

<p>If you appeal after 30 days, you must explain why. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will look at the information you give them to decide if they can accept your late appeal.</p>

<h2>How to appeal</h2>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>use the appeal form if one came with the letter <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> sent you</li>
  <li>appeal in writing to the office that sent the letter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Appeal by letter</h3>

<p>If you appeal by letter, you must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>your name</li>
  <li>your 10-digit unique taxpayer reference number </li>
  <li>the amount of the tax you’re appealing against</li>
  <li>the reasons why you’re appealing</li>
</ul>
<p>You must sign the letter.</p>


</article><article id="delaying-payment-of-a-penalty-or-tax-bill-if-youre-appealing"><header><h1>Part 3: Delaying payment of a penalty or tax bill if you're appealing</h1>
  </header><p>You may decide to delay paying a penalty or tax bill if you disagree with the amount you have to pay.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) doesn’t agree with your appeal, you may have to pay interest on the amount you pay late.</p>
</div>

<h2>To delay paying a penalty</h2>

<p>Once you’ve appealed, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> won’t ask you to pay the penalty until the appeal has been settled.</p>

<h2>To delay paying tax due</h2>

<p>When you appeal, write to the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> office that sent you the letter about your tax bill or penalty, telling them:</p>

<ul>
<li>why you think the amount you’ve been asked to pay is too much</li>
  <li>what you think the correct amount is and when you’ll pay it</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will tell you in writing if they agree.</p>


</article><article id="after-your-appeal"><header><h1>Part 4: After your appeal</h1>
  </header><p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will look at your appeal and tell you their decision in writing - along with how much you must pay or be repaid. </p>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> agrees with your appeal, you won’t have to pay interest on any tax and penalties paid late. </p>

<p>If they don’t agree with your appeal, they will tell you why and ask if you accept their decision. If you do, you should pay the amount due, including interest.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the appeal decision, you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to review their decision - their letter will tell you how to do this</li>
  <li>appeal to the independent <a href="/tax-tribunal" title="Appealing to the tax tribunal">tax tribunal</a>
</li>
