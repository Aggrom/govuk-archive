  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="appeal-against-a-penalty"><header><h1>Part 1: Appeal against a penalty</h1>
  </header><p>You may be <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns/penalties" title="Penalties for late tax returns and payments">charged a penalty</a> if you’ve missed the tax return or payment deadline. </p>

<p>You can appeal against the penalty if you’ve got a ‘reasonable excuse’ for being late.</p>

<h3>What may be a reasonable excuse</h3>

<p>A reasonable excuse is something that is unexpected and outside your control that prevented you from sending your tax return or payment on time, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>a close family member died</li>
  <li>you had a serious or life-threatening illness</li>
  <li>you lost important documents in a fire and couldn’t complete your tax return</li>
  <li>your cheque wasn’t paid or your payment failed because of an error by your bank</li>
  <li>you registered for the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) online service on time but didn’t get your activation code or user ID in time</li>
</ul>
<h3>What’s unlikely to be a reasonable excuse</h3>

<p>The following aren’t usually accepted as a reasonable excuse:</p>

<ul>
<li>pressure of work</li>
  <li>you found the tax return too difficult to complete</li>
  <li>your cheque bounced or payment failed because you didn’t have enough money</li>
  <li>you didn’t get a reminder from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you registered for the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> online service too late and didn’t get your activation code or user ID in time</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to appeal</h2>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=3ScvEs7_4vk&amp;formId=6706" title="Form to appeal against a Self Assessment penalty">fill in an appeal form</a></li>
  <li>use the appeal form that came with your penalty letter</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Only the nominated partner can appeal against penalties for sending partnership tax returns late.</p>
</div>

<h2>Appeal deadlines</h2>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must appeal within 30 days of the date of the penalty letter you get from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you appeal after 30 days, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will decide if they will consider your appeal.</p>


</article><article id="appeal-against-a-tax-bill"><header><h1>Part 2: Appeal against a tax bill</h1>
  </header><h2>If you think your tax bill is wrong</h2>

<p>If you think you’ve made a mistake on your tax return, you may be able to <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns/corrections" title="Correcting your tax return">correct it.</a></p>

<p>If HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) has estimated the bill because you didn’t send a tax return, you should <a href="/file-your-self-assessment-tax-return" title="Send your Self Assessment tax return online">send your tax return.</a> </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll be sent a new tax bill if you correct or amend your tax return.</p>
</div>

<p>If you disagree with your bill because <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> have changed what you owe after a check on your return, you can appeal against it.</p>

<h2>Appeal deadlines</h2>

<p>You have 30 days from the date of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s letter to appeal.</p>

<p>If you appeal after 30 days, you’ll have to explain why. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will decide if they will accept your appeal.</p>

<h2>How to appeal</h2>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>use the appeal form if one came with the letter <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> sent you</li>
  <li>appeal in writing to the office that sent the letter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Appeal by letter</h2>

<p>If you appeal by letter, you must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>your name</li>
  <li>your 10-digit unique taxpayer reference number </li>
  <li>the amount of the tax or penalty you’re appealing against</li>
  <li>the reasons why you’re appealing</li>
</ul>
<p>You must sign the letter.</p>


</article><article id="delay-payment-of-a-penalty-or-tax-bill"><header><h1>Part 3: Delay payment of a penalty or tax bill</h1>
  </header><p>You may be able to delay paying a penalty or tax bill if you’re appealing the amount you have to pay.</p>

<p>Write to the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) office that sent you the letter about your tax bill or penalty, telling them:</p>

<ul>
<li>why you think the amount you’ve been asked to pay is too much</li>
  <li>what you think the correct amount is and when you’ll pay it</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will tell you in writing if they agree.</p>

<p>You may have to pay interest on the amount you don’t pay straight away.</p>

<p>If you win your appeal, the interest will be cancelled and repaid. If you lose your appeal, you may have to pay interest.</p>


</article><article id="after-your-appeal"><header><h1>Part 4: After your appeal</h1>
  </header><p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will tell you their decision in writing - along with how much you must pay or be repaid.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the appeal decision, you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/complaints-appeals/how-to-appeal/indirect-tax.htm#2" title="How to ask HMRC to review one of their decisions">review their decision</a>
