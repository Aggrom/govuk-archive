The employer must then pass this to the CSA - if they don't, the CSA can take them to court.\r\n\r\nIf the paying parent gets benefits, a State Pension or War Pension, the CSA can take the amount owed from these payments.\r\n\r\n###Taking money from a bank or building society account\r\n\r\nThe CSA doesn't need permission to do this. It can tell the bank or building society to take either:\r\n\r\n- regular payments\r\n- a one-off payment\r\n\r\n###Taking court action\r\n\r\nThe CSA can take a paying parent to court over unpaid child maintenance. Things the courts can do include:\r\n\r\n- sending bailiffs (Sheriff Officers in Scotland) to a paying parent's home to take and sell their belongings to get the child maintenance owed\r\n- sending a paying parent to prison\r\n- collecting money that's owed to the paying parent by someone else and using this to pay the child maintenance owed\r\n- forcing the sale of a property and using the money to pay the child maintenance owed\r\n\r\nIf a paying parent tries to avoid paying by selling property or transferring it to someone else, the CSA can ask the courts to stop them.\r\n\r\nThe CSA can also ask the courts to reverse any sale or transfer that's already happened.\r\n\r\n^If the CSA takes action through the courts, the paying parent may have to pay the CSA's legal costs as well as their own.^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*[CSA]: Child Support Agency","slug":"nonpayment-what-happens","title":"Non-payment"}},{"table":{"body":"If someone denies they're the parent of a child, the Child Support Agency (CSA) will:\r\n\r\n- ask them for evidence proving they're not the parent\r\n- tell the other parent what's happened and ask for evidence to prove parentage\r\n\r\nIf the person named as the parent can't give evidence proving they're not, the CSA can:\r\n\r\n- ask both parents to take a [DNA test](dna-tests \"DNA tests\")\r\n- ask the courts to make a decision\r\n\r\n##Presumed parentage\r\n\r\nThe CSA can presume parentage if the person named as the parent:\r\n\r\n- was married to the child's mother at any time between the conception and birth of the child (unless the child was adopted)\r\n- is named on the child's birth certificate (unless the child was adopted)\r\n- has taken a DNA test that shows they're the parent\r\n- has legally adopted the child\r\n- is named in a court order as the parent when the child was born to a surrogate mother\r\n\r\nIf the CSA presumes parentage it will work out a child maintenance amount.
