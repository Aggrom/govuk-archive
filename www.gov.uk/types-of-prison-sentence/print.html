  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="concurrent-and-consecutive-sentences"><header><h1>Part 1: Concurrent and consecutive sentences</h1>
  </header><p>If someone’s convicted of committing more than one crime, they’re usually given a sentence for each crime.</p>

<p>Concurrent sentences are served at the same time.</p>

<p>Consecutive sentences are served one after the other - eg a 6 month sentence followed by a 3 month sentence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The judge (or magistrate) tells the person what type of sentence they get and how it must be served.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="suspended-prison-sentences"><header><h1>Part 2: Suspended prison sentences</h1>
  </header><p>A ‘suspended’ prison sentence is carried out in the community.</p>

<p>The person has to meet certain conditions - eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>having to stay away from a certain place or person</li>
  <li>doing unpaid work - called <a href="/community-sentences" title="Community Payback">‘Community Payback’</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the person breaks the conditions of their sentence they can be sent to prison.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="determinate-prison-sentences-fixed-length-of-time"><header><h1>Part 3: Determinate prison sentences - fixed length of time</h1>
  </header><p>A ‘determinate’ prison sentence is for a fixed length of time.</p>

<h2>If the sentence is for 12 months or more</h2>

<p>For prison sentences of 12 months or more the person spends the first half of the sentence in prison and the second half in the community ‘on licence’.</p>

<p>If they break any licence conditions - eg they commit another crime - they could go back to prison.</p>

<h2>If the sentence is under 12 months</h2>

<p>For prison sentences under 12 months, the person’s normally released automatically half-way through.</p>

</article><article id="indeterminate-prison-sentences-no-fixed-length-of-time"><header><h1>Part 4: Indeterminate prison sentences - no fixed length of time</h1>
  </header><p>An ‘indeterminate’ prison sentence doesn’t have a fixed length of time. </p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>no date is set when the person will be released</li>
  <li>they have to spend a minimum amount of time in prison (called a ‘tariff’) before they’re considered for release</li>
</ul>
<p>The Parole Board is responsible for deciding if <a href="/leaving-prison" title="Parole Board">someone can be be released from prison.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Indeterminate sentences are given if a court thinks an offender is a danger to the public.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="life-sentences"><header><h1>Part 5: Life sentences</h1>
  </header><p>If a person’s found guilty of murder, a court must give them a life sentence.</p>

<p>A court may choose to give a life sentence for serious offences like:</p>

<ul>
<li>rape</li>
  <li>armed robbery</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A life sentence lasts for the rest of a person’s life – if they’re released from prison and commit another crime they can be sent back to prison at any time.</p>
</div>

<h2>Whole life term</h2>

<p>A whole life term means there’s no minimum term set by the judge, and the person’s never considered for release.</p>


</article><article id="sentences-for-young-people"><header><h1>Part 6: Sentences for young people</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>People under 18 get different sentences to adults.</p>
</div>

<h2>Detention and Training Order</h2>

<p>A Detention and Training Order can be given to someone aged between 12 and 17.</p>

<p>They last between 4 months and 2 years.</p>

<p>The first half of a Detention and Training Order is served in custody, the second half is served in the community.</p>

<h3>Violent or sexual crimes</h3>

<p>For severe crimes - usually violent or sexual - young people can get an ‘extended sentence’. They could spend a long time in custody, and when released they’ll be put under supervision for a long time (eg being tagged).</p>

<h3>Murder</h3>

<p>For murder, the court sets the minimum amount of time to be spent in custody. The young person can’t apply for <a href="/leaving-prison" title="Parole">parole</a> before this time.</p>

<p>When released, the young person will be kept under supervision for the rest of their life.</p>

<h3>Other serious crimes</h3>

<p>Sometimes the sentence for a young person can last as long as the sentence for an adult for the same offence (but not longer). This includes <a href="life-sentences" title="Life sentences">life sentences</a>.</p>
