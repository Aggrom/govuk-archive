  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>State Pension is a regular payment from the government. You may get it when you reach your <a rel="external" href="http://pensions-service.direct.gov.uk/en/state-pension-age-calculator/home.asp" title="State Pension age">State Pension age.</a></p>

<p>The State Pension is made up of 2 parts: </p>

<ul>
<li>basic State Pension</li>
  <li><a href="/additional-state-pension" title="Additional State Pension">Additional State Pension</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can claim up to £107.45 a week for basic State Pension. The amount you get depends on the number of years you’ve been paying National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>The <a href="/additional-state-pension#what-youll-get" title="What additional State Pension you'll get">amount of additional State Pension you can get</a> isn’t fixed - it depends on your circumstances.</p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><h2>Get a detailed State Pension statement</h2>

<p>If you’re approaching State Pension age, a <a href="/forecast-your-state-pension" title="State Pension statement">State Pension statement</a> can give you detailed information about what you’d get based on your National Insurance contributions so far.</p>

<h2>Basic State Pension</h2>

<p>You can get the maximum amount of basic State Pension if you have paid enough <a href="/national-insurance/how-much-national-insurance-you-pay" title="How much National Insurance you pay">National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>)</a>. If you don’t have <a href="/state-pension#eligibility" title="Eligibility">enough contributions</a>, you may get less.</p>

<p>If you’re married or in a civil partnership, your spouse or civil partner’s <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> may also make a difference.</p>

<h2>Additional State Pension</h2>

<p>The <a href="/additional-state-pension#what-youll-get" title="What you'll get">amount of additional State Pension you can get</a> depends on your <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and whether or not you choose to opt out - there isn’t a flat rate. </p>

<h2>State Pension increases</h2>

<p>The basic State Pension currently goes up each year by whichever is the highest:</p>

<ul>
<li>the average percentage growth in wages (in Great Britain)</li>
  <li>average price increases (measured by the Consumer Price Index or <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr>) </li>
  <li>2.5%</li>
</ul>
<p>The additional State Pension goes up each year in line with the <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr>.</p>

<h2>How it’s paid</h2>

<p>State Pension is paid directly into an account of your choice.</p>

<h2>Basic State Pension</h2>

<p>The amount you get is based on ‘qualifying years’ - the number of years you’ve been paying <a href="/national-insurance" title="National Insurance (NI)">National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>)</a> contributions. </p>

<p>The table shows how many years you need, depending on your birthdate and whether you’re a man or woman.</p>

<table><tbody>

    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Men born before 6 April 1945</td>
