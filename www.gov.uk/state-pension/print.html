  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The basic State Pension is a weekly or monthly payment from the government that you can get when you reach <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension age calculator">State Pension age</a> (usually between 65 and 68, depending on when you were born). </p>

<p>The most you can currently get is £107.45 per week. The basic State Pension increases every year by at least 2.5%.</p>


</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>You get up to £107.45 per week.</p>

<p>If you’re a married or in a civil partnership and not working or claiming certain benefits you can get up to £64.40 per week. </p>

<p>Use the <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="State Pension calculator">State Pension calculator</a> to get an estimate. </p>

<p>You might also qualify for the <a href="/additional-state-pension" title="Additional State Pension">Additional State Pension</a> or, if you’re on a low income, <a href="/pension-credit" title="Pension Credit">Pension Credit.</a></p>

<h2>How it’s paid</h2>
<p>The basic State Pension is paid weekly or monthly into an account of your choice. </p>

<p>There are different rules <a href="/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/how-to-claim" title="State Pension if you live abroad">if you live abroad.</a></p>

<h2>You’re close to State Pension age</h2>
<p>You can get a <a href="/forecast-your-state-pension" title="State Pension forecast">State Pension forecast</a> that tells you exactly how much you’ll get. </p>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You get the basic State Pension once you reached <a href="/calculate-state-pension" title="calculate state pension age">State Pension age.</a> </p>

<p>Your basic State Pension depends on the number of years you’ve paid <a href="/national-insurance/overview%20%E2%80%9CNational%20Insurance%E2%80%9D">National Insurance</a> or got <a href="/boost-state-pension/overview" title="National Insurance credits">National Insurance credits</a> while claiming certain benefits.</p>

<p>To qualify for a basic State Pension at least one of the following must apply to you:</p>

<ul>
<li>you were working and paying National Insurance with your tax </li>
  <li>you were getting certain benefits, eg for unemployment, sickness, disability </li>
  <li>you were a parent or carer and claiming certain benefits </li>
  <li>you have a spouse or partner whose National Insurance contributions cover you </li>
  <li>you were paying voluntary National Insurance contributions </li>
</ul>
<p>To get the full basic State Pension you need 30 years worth of contributions. These are your ‘qualifying years’. If you have fewer than 30 years your State Pension will be less than £107.45 per week. </p>

<p>Use the <a href="/state-pension-calculator" title="state pension calculator">State Pension calculator</a> to find out how many qualifying years you have and what your State Pension would be now.</p>

<h3>You’re working</h3>
<p>When you’re working you pay National Insurance with your tax and get qualifying years if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re employed and earning over £5,564</li>
  <li>you’re self-employed and earning over £5,595</li>
</ul>
<h2>You’re not working</h2>

<p>In some circumstances when you’re not working the government will give you <a href="/boost-state-pension/overview" title="National Insurance credits">‘National Insurance credits’</a> that count as qualifying years towards your basic State Pension.</p>

<p>Since April 2010 - you get credits if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you care for a child under 12</li>
  <li>you care for someone sick or disabled</li>
  <li>you are a registered foster carer</li>
  <li>you get Carer’s Allowance</li>
</ul>
<p>Before April 2010 - you got credits if any of the following applied:</p>

<ul>
<li>you claimed Child Benefit for a child under 16</li>
  <li>you cared for someone sick or disabled</li>
  <li>you worked as a registered carer</li>
  <li>you got Carer’s Allowance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Married or in a civil partnership</h2>
<p>If you’re not eligible for a State Pension or not getting the full amount, you might be able to qualify or ‘top up’ through your spouse’s or partner’s National Insurance contributions if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you were born after 6 April 1950</li>
  <li>you have both reached State Pension age </li>
  <li>your spouse or partner qualifies for some basic State Pension </li>
</ul>
<p>You do this through <a href="/how-to-claim" title="claim your State Pension">claiming your State Pension.</a> </p>

<h2>You don’t qualify for a full State Pension</h2>
<p>If you’re not covered by any of these groups but want a State Pension you can <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/why-pay-voluntary-contributions" title="voluntary National Insurance contributions">pay voluntary National Insurance contributions.</a> You can also do this to top up if you don’t have 30 qualifying years and want the full amount.</p>

<h2>Men born before 1945 and women born before 1950</h2>

<p>You need more qualifying years to get a full State Pension and a certain minimum number of years to get any State Pension at all. </p>

<h2>What happens to your State Pension when you die</h2>
