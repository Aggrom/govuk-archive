Emissions may also be tested as part of a roadside check.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>MOT</h2>\n<p>Most vehicles have their exhaust emissions tested as part of the MOT.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, they&rsquo;re tested using a meter. Petrol vehicles used before August 1975 and diesel vehicles used before August 1979 are tested by sight.</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle fails the emission test it fails the MOT. The problem must be fixed before you can get an MOT certificate.</p>\n\n<p>The only vehicles that don&rsquo;t have an emissions test as part of the MOT are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>vehicles with less than 4 wheels</li>\n  <li>those with 2-stroke engines</li>\n  <li>hybrid vehicles</li>\n  <li>quadricycles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roadside checks</h2>\n<p>Your vehicle can also be tested during a roadside check.</p>\n\n<p>If it fails the check, you&rsquo;ll be given a prohibition notice. You&rsquo;ll have 10 days to fix the problem. If you don&rsquo;t fix it within this period you may be prosecuted. </p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle is seriously in breach of the legal emission limits, or if it has other defects which make it dangerous, the notice will come into effect immediately. You won&rsquo;t be able to use the vehicle. You may also be prosecuted.</p>\n\n<h2>Air Quality Management Areas</h2>\n<p>A number of borough councils have been designated &lsquo;Air Quality Management Areas&rsquo;. This means the council can test vehicles at the roadside and issue fixed penalties to drivers whose vehicles fail. </p>\n\n<p>Contact <a href=\"/find-your-local-council\" title=\"Find your local council\">your local council</a> to find out about checks and penalties in your area.</p>\n","alternative_title":""},"updated_at":"2012-11-12T11:41:33+00:00","tags":[{"title":"MOT and vehicle insurance","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/driving%2Fmot-insurance.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes getting an MOT, MOT fees and vehicle insurance","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=driving%2Fmot-insurance","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/mot-insurance"},"parent":{"title":"Driving, transport, and travel","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/driving.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Book your driving test or get a tax disc online, find out the legal requirements for buying, owning, importing or scrapping a car or motorcycle, and read about your rights and responsibilities as a driver.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=driving","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/getting-an-mot.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/getting-an-mot","title":"Getting an MOT","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"146","business_proposition":false,"description":"How to MOT your vehicle, what the certificate covers, get an MOT text message reminder, how to appeal if your vehicle fails its MOT test"},"updated_at":"2012-11-05T16:00:07+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers","title":"Roadside vehicle checks for commercial drivers","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"B198","business_proposition":false,"description":"Being stopped by the police or VOSA - fixed penalties, roadside prohibitions, driving without an operator's licence, immobilisation and impounding"},"updated_at":"2012-11-13T15:28:54+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/use-van-fuel-tools.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/use-van-fuel-tools","title":"Fuel consumption and emissions for vans","format":"transaction","details":{"need_id":"B878","business_proposition":true,"description":"Fuel consumption and CO2 emissions data for vans and light commercial vehicles"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:12:53+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/co2-and-vehicle-tax-tools.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/co2-and-vehicle-tax-tools","title":"Car fuel and CO2 emissions data","format":"transaction","details":{"need_id":"B910","business_proposition":true,"description":"Check fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and vehicle tax bands by make model and registration"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:24:14+00:00"}]}
