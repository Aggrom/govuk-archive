It also includes gifts sent to you.</p>\n\n<h2>Paying for your goods and collecting them</h2>\n<p>Royal Mail or Parcelforce will deal with customs on your behalf. They won&rsquo;t deal with any disputes about customs charges. They’ll charge you a handling fee for dealing with the customs process. This is a separate fee from any duty and <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> you may have to pay. </p>\n\n<p>When your goods are ready for collection they&rsquo;ll write to you. You must collect your goods and pay any charges within 3 weeks or they&rsquo;ll be sent back. </p>\n\n<h2>Declaring goods</h2>\n\n<p>Goods imported by post from another EU country don’t need a customs declaration form. </p>\n\n<h3>Who deals with customs procedures?</h3>\n\n<p>When you import goods from outside the EU, the sender must complete a customs declaration form. Check with them that the form is filled in correctly. By law, this is your responsibility. HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr>) can fine you or seize your goods if there is a mistake on the form. In some circumstances you might be prosecuted. </p>\n\n<p>If you have an agreement with the sender that you deal with customs procedures and declare the goods, the sender must clearly write ‘goods to be declared by importer’ on the form. </p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr> will then send you a full customs declaration form and tell you how much tax and duty you have to pay if any. However, this can delay the receipt of your goods by at least 4 weeks. </p>\n\n<p>If the form isn&rsquo;t marked this way, the sender has to declare the goods. </p>\n\n<h2>Paying <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr></h2>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to pay <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> on most goods sent from another EU country. </p>\n\n<p>For goods sent from non-EU countries you have to pay <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> if they&rsquo;re worth more than £15 and on all items sent to the UK from the Channel Islands. </p>\n\n<p>If it&rsquo;s a gift, for example from a friend or relative, you only have to pay <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> if it&rsquo;s worth more than £40.</p>\n\n<p>You must always pay <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> on the following goods, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much they cost or where they&rsquo;re sent from: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>alcohol </li>\n  <li>tobacco products </li>\n  <li>perfumes and toilet waters </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The value you pay <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> on includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>local sales taxes</li>\n  <li>postage, packaging</li>\n  <li>insurance </li>\n  <li>any duty already charged </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Paying customs duty</h2>\n<p>You pay duty on goods from outside the EU if they’re above a certain value.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Type and value of goods</th>\n      <th>Customs duty</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Merchandise £0 - £135</td>\n      <td>No duty</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Merchandise above £135 and gifts above £630</td>\n      <td>Duty depends on the type of goods and their country of origin, call the helpline (duty less than £9 isn&rsquo;t collected)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Gifts less than £630</td>\n      <td>2.5% flat rate (duty less than £9 isn&rsquo;t collected)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The value of the items includes local sales taxes, postage, packaging and insurance.</p>\n\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<p><strong><abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr>, customs and excise helpline</strong><br />\n<strong>Telephone:</strong> 0845 010 9000<br />\n<strong>Textphone:</strong> 0845 000 0200</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Paying excise duty</h2>\n\n<p>Excise duty is charged on alcohol and tobacco sent by post from other EU countries or from outside the EU.
