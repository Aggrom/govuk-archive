If your tenants have one of these:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>You must usually give them ‘<a href=\"/evicting-tenants/eviction-notices\" title=\"Ending a tenancy\">notice to quit</a>’.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If your tenants don’t leave by the date on the notice to quit, you must send them a ‘notice of intention to seek possession’ - this tells them you’ll apply to the court for a possession order if they don’t leave.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You must then apply to the court for a possession order, which gives you the right to evict your tenants and take possession of the property.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the court gives you a possession order and your tenants still don’t leave, you must apply for a warrant for eviction - this means bailiffs can remove your tenants from the property.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>A fixed-term AST</h3>\n\n<p>Fixed-term tenancies run for a set amount of time. You must <a href=\"/evicting-tenants/eviction-notices\" title=\"Eviction notices\">give your tenants notice</a> in a certain way if your tenants have a fixed-term tenancy.</p>\n\n<p>If your tenants refuse to leave after being given notice, you must follow the same steps as for a periodic tenancy, from step 2.</p>\n\n<h2>Rules for excluded tenancies or licenses</h2>\n\n<p>If your tenants have an <a href=\"/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/tenancy-types\" title=\"excluded tenancy or licence\">excluded tenancy or licence</a> (eg they live with you), you don’t have to go to court to evict them.</p>\n\n<p>You only need to give them ‘reasonable notice’ to quit. Reasonable notice usually means the length of the rental payment period - so if your tenants pay rent weekly, you can give them 1 week’s notice. The notice doesn’t have to be in writing.</p>\n\n<p>You can then change the locks on their rooms, even if they still have belongings there. However, you must give your tenants’ belongings back to them.</p>\n\n<p>Your council can take action against you if you evict your tenants illegally.</p>\n\n<h2>Rules for assured and regulated tenancies</h2>\n\n<p>If your tenants started their tenancy before 27 February 1997, they might have an assured or a regulated tenancy. You will then have to follow different rules to evict them and they’ll have increased protection from eviction.</p>\n\n<p>Shelter has more information about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/private_tenancies/assured_tenancies/\" title=\"Assured tenancies\">assured tenancies</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/private_tenancies/regulated_tenancies/\" title=\"Regulated tenancies\">regulated tenancies.</a></p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/accelerated-possession","slug":"accelerated-possession","order":2,"title":"Accelerated possession","body":"<p>In England and Wales, you can sometimes evict tenants using ‘accelerated possession’.

If your tenants are in an exceptionally difficult situation, the judge may agree to delay this for up to 6 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>If your tenants don’t leave your property by the date given, you can ask the court to evict them by asking for a ‘warrant for possession’. If the court gives a warrant, your tenants will be sent an eviction notice that gives a date when they must leave your property.</p>\n\n<h2>Suspended order for possession</h2>\n\n<p>This means if your tenants make the payments, or obey the conditions, set out in the order, they can stay in your property. If they don’t make the payments, you can ask the court to evict them.</p>\n\n<h2>Money order</h2>\n\n<p>This means your tenants have to pay you the amount set out in the order. If they don’t make the payments, action could be taken by the courts to recover the money, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deducting money from your tenants’ wages or bank account</li>\n  <li>sending bailiffs to take away things they own</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your tenants get into rent arrears after a money order has been made, you can go to court again and ask for a possession order.</p>\n\n<h2>Possession orders with a money judgment</h2>\n\n<p>A judge can add a money judgment to any of the possession orders. This means your tenants owe a specific amount of money, usually made up of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>their rent arrears</li>\n  <li>court fees</li>\n  <li>your legal costs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The money judgment won’t apply if your tenants pay their arrears and the amount set out in a suspended possession order.</p>\n\n<p>However, the money judgment will apply if they don’t pay the amount set out in the suspended possession order that’s linked to the judgment.
