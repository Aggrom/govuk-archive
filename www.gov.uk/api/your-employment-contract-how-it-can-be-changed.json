You can&rsquo;t insist on making changes unless they&rsquo;re covered by a statutory right (eg not working on a Sunday). </p>\n\n<p>If your employer wants to make changes, they should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>consult or negotiate with you or your representative (eg from a trade union or staff association)</li>\n  <li>explain the reasons why</li>\n  <li>listen to alternative ideas you may have</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/your-employment-contract-how-it-can-be-changed/types-of-change","slug":"types-of-change","order":2,"title":"Types of change","body":"<p>If your employer changes any terms in your <a href=\"/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars\" title=\"Written statement of employment particulars\">written statement</a> with your agreement, they must confirm the change in writing within a month. You must be told exactly what has changed in the statement. </p>\n\n<p>If your employer changes terms and conditions that aren&rsquo;t in the <a href=\"/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars\" title=\"Written statement of employment particulars\">written statement</a> (eg like the right to sick leave), they should tell you where to find information about the change (eg a company handbook, noticeboard or intranet site).  </p>\n\n<h2>Collective agreements and changes to written statements</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements\" title=\"Collective agreements\">collective agreement</a> may exist between your employer and trade unions or a staff association. If your employer makes agreed changes to the terms of the collective agreement, they should inform you in writing.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiations under a collective agreement can lead to changes in the terms of your <a href=\"/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars\" title=\"Written statement of employment particulars\">written statement</a> (eg pay or working hours).  If you are covered by a collective agreement, any changes will apply to you whether you are a member of a union or staff association or not.</p>\n\n<h2>Flexibility clauses</h2>\n<p>Flexibility clauses are terms in your contract that give your employer the right to change some of your terms and conditions. A flexibility clause could be that your job location can be changed. </p>\n\n<p>Your employer isn&rsquo;t allowed to make completely unreasonable changes using a flexibility clause. </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong> telling you to move to another country to work at 1 day&rsquo;s notice would be completely unreasonable.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Changes of employer</h2>\n<p>If your employer changes, usually you must be given a new <a href=\"/employment-contracts-and-conditions/written-statement-of-employment-particulars\" title=\"Written statement of employment particulars\">written statement of particulars</a> within 2 months.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the name of the business changes or there&rsquo;s a <a href=\"/business-transfers-and-takeovers-your-rights/overview\" title=\"Business transfers and takeovers - your rights\">new employer</a> but no other changes in terms and conditions, your employer doesn&rsquo;t need to issue a new written statement. However, they should inform you in writing of the changes within a month.</p>\n\n<h2>Disciplinary measures</h2>\n<p>Sometimes changes to your terms and conditions like a demotion can happen as a result of a disciplinary measure. </p>\n\n<p>Your employer should make sure the staff handbook or intranet site contains information about how this could happen in the section dealing with disciplinary procedures.</p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/your-employment-contract-how-it-can-be-changed/problems-with-changes","slug":"problems-with-changes","order":3,"title":"Problems with changes","body":"<p>Problems can arise if: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>an employer tries to change your contract without agreement or re-employs you on new terms and conditions</li>\n  <li>there is a breach of contract where one of the terms in a contract is broken (eg an employer doesn&rsquo;t pay agreed wages or employees don&rsquo;t work agreed hours)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Talk to your employer</h2>\n<p>If you have a problem over contract changes, try to <a href=\"/solve-workplace-dispute/overview\" title=\"Solve a workplace dispute\">solve</a> things informally by talking to your employer or through <a href=\"/solve-workplace-dispute/mediation-conciliation-and-arbitration\" title=\"Mediation, conciliation and arbitration\">mediation.</a></p>\n\n<p>You can also get advice from your trade union representative (if you&rsquo;re a member of a union), <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"Citizen's Advice\">Citizen&rsquo;s Advice</a> or <abbr title=\"Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\">ACAS</abbr>.

If you live in Northern Ireland you can take your case to an industrial tribunal.</p>\n\n<p>If you go to a tribunal, your employer may be able to make a counter-claim. </p>\n\n<p>Claims and counter-claims can only go to a tribunal if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>are related to an employment contract issue</li>\n  <li>still haven&rsquo;t been solved when the employee ends their employment with your company</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, the claim or counter-claim mustn&rsquo;t be related to a personal injury or things like a contract term that deals with <a href=\"/intellectual-property-an-overview/what-is-intellectual-property\" title=\"What is intellectual property\">intellectual property rights.</a> </p>\n\n<h3>Time limits</h3>\n<p>Usually, you must make a claim to a tribunal within 3 months of ending your employment at the company. Your employer must make a counter-claim within 6 weeks of receiving a copy of your claim. </p>\n\n<h3>Compensation limits</h3>\n<p>If a tribunal agrees with your claim, they may award you compensation. You can only get compensation for financial loss (eg non-payment of wages) in breach of contract claim. The maximum compensation that can be given is Â£25,000.</p>\n\n"}]},"updated_at":"2012-10-14T14:29:14+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Your contract and working hours","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working%2Fcontract-working-hours.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes employment status, workers' rights and changes to contracts","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working%2Fcontract-working-hours","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/contract-working-hours"},"parent":{"title":"Working, jobs and pensions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes holidays and finding a job","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/employment-contracts-and-conditions.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions","title":"Employment contracts","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"352","business_proposition":true},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:30:54+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/employment-tribunals.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunals","title":"Take your employer to an employment tribunal","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"366","business_proposition":false},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:24:43+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/raise-grievance-at-work.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/raise-grievance-at-work","title":"Raise a grievance at work","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"363","business_proposition":false},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:25:11+00:00"}]}
