You can buy more later, until you own 100%. This is called &lsquo;staircasing&rsquo;. </p>\n\n<p>If you buy more of your home, your rent will go down - because it&rsquo;s based on how much of the property you rent. Your landlord can charge rent of up to 3% of the value of their share of your home, per year.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong>\nYour home is worth £240,000 and you buy a 50% share. Your landlord charges you 3% rent on their 50% share. 3% of £120,000 is £3,600 per year.
