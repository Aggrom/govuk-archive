These days are called ‘keeping in touch days’. Keeping in touch days are optional, both the employee and employer need to agree to them. </p>\n\n<p>The type of work and pay employees get should be agreed before they come into work. The employee&rsquo;s right to maternity, adoption or additional paternity leave and pay isn&rsquo;t affected by taking keeping in touch days. </p>\n\n<h2>Terms and conditions protection</h2>\n\n<p>Normally, the employment terms and conditions are protected and employees are entitled to any pay rises and improvements in terms and conditions given during their leave.</p>\n\n<p>Pension contributions usually stop if a period of leave is unpaid. For example, unpaid periods of maternity leave or parental leave. </p>\n\n<p>Employees continue to build up holiday entitlement and can take any holiday they&rsquo;ve accrued (built up) before or after their leave.</p>\n\n<h2>Returning to work</h2>\n\n<p>Employees have the right to return to their job if they take:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ordinary Maternity or Ordinary Adoption leave </li>\n  <li>Ordinary Paternity Leave </li>\n  <li>Additional Paternity Leave </li>\n  <li>4 weeks or less of parental leave </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The rules are different if the employee takes: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Additional Maternity or Additional Adoption Leave </li>\n  <li>more than 4 weeks of parental leave  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this situation, employees have the right to their job or a similar job (if it&rsquo;s not possible to give them their old job). Similar means the job has the same or better terms and conditions. If the employee unreasonably refuses to take the similar job the employer can take this as their resignation. </p>\n\n<h2>Redundancy</h2>\n\n<p>While an employee is on maternity, adoption, paternity or parental leave they have the: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>same <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\" title=\"Redundancy: your rights\">redundancy rights</a> as their colleagues</li>\n  <li>right to be offered any suitable alternative job if they&rsquo;re selected for redundancy (even if other colleagues are more suitable for the role) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An employee can only be made redundant if the employer can clearly justify doing it - eg a part of the business closes and everyone in that section is made redundant. There are other <a href=\"/staff-redundant\" title=\"Employer guide: making staff redundant\">rules for employers</a> when making staff redundant. </p>\n","alternative_title":""},"updated_at":"2012-11-29T10:36:38+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Statutory leave and time off","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people%2Ftime-off.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes maternity and paternity leave, holiday entitlement and sick pay","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people%2Ftime-off","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people/time-off"},"parent":{"title":"Employing people","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes pay, contracts and hiring","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Holidays, time off, sick leave, maternity and paternity leave","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working%2Ftime-off.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes career breaks and the holiday entitlement calculator","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working%2Ftime-off","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/time-off"},"parent":{"title":"Working, jobs and pensions","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/working.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes holidays and finding a job","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=working","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Business Link","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/businesslink.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"legacy_source"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=businesslink","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/businesslink"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/paternityleave.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/paternityleave","title":"Paternity Leave","format":"programme","details":{"need_id":"1759","business_proposition":false,"description":"Paternity leave - how much you can take, who is eligible and how to claim"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:14:10+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/employment-contracts-and-conditions.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions","title":"Employment contracts","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"352","business_proposition":true,"description":"A contract is an agreement between employee and employer setting out implied and explicit terms  and conditions - written statement of particulars, collective agreements"},"updated_at":"2012-11-22T17:04:46+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/adoption-leave.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/adoption-leave","title":"Adoption Leave","format":"programme","details":{"need_id":"2008","business_proposition":false,"description":"How much Adoption Leave you'll get if you're eligible, including if you're adopting a child from overseas and how you should claim this leave"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:25:03+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/maternity-leave.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/maternity-leave","title":"Maternity Leave","format":"programme","details":{"need_id":"1862","business_proposition":false,"description":"Maternity leave and checking your eligibility to take it - including Ordinary Maternity Leave, Additional Maternity Leave and your right to return to work\r\n"},"updated_at":"2012-11-28T17:13:25+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/solve-workplace-dispute.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/solve-workplace-dispute","title":"Solve a workplace dispute","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"365","business_proposition":false,"description":"Grievances and disciplinary action at work can be solved by informal discussions, formal procedures, mediation, conciliation or arbitration"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:17:50+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/working-when-pregnant-your-rights.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights","title":"Pregnant employees' rights","format":"answer","details":{"need_id":"2194","business_proposition":false,"description":"Legal rights for pregnant employees - including paid time off for antenatal appointments, maternity leave and pay, protection against discrimination and telling the employer about the pregnancy"},"updated_at":"2012-11-28T17:23:02+00:00"}]}
