what happens if you break the terms of your lease, use a clause in your agreement","language":"en","body":"\n<div class=\"summary\">\n<p>A commercial property lease usually continues until its end date unless you include a clause to end it earlier.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Break clause</h2>\n\n<p>This is an official date in the lease, agreed by the landlord and tenant, where the lease can be &lsquo;broken&rsquo; without anyone facing a penalty. As a tenant, you need to give your landlord 2 months notice that you are using the break clause. As a landlord, you can only use it if your tenant agrees.  </p>\n\n<h2>Tenants and ending a lease</h2>\n\n<p>As a tenant, you can also end your lease early if: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the landlord agrees</li>\n  <li>you pass the lease on to someone else (though the landlord may want you to provide a guarantee)</li>\n  <li>you&rsquo;re allowed to sublet (you&rsquo;ll still remain responsible for the rent, even if you&rsquo;re not trading from the premises)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>If these situations don’t apply you must continue to pay rent for the whole tenancy period.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Landlords and ending a lease</h2>\n\n<p>As a landlord, you can only end a lease when the tenant fails to pay rent or meet other lease obligations.</p>\n\n<p>If you have included a &lsquo;forfeiture clause&rsquo; in the lease, you can use it in these situations to end the lease.  However, if the tenant can challenge this in court they may be allowed to stay in the property.</p>\n\n<h2>Fixed-term tenancy</h2>\n\n<p>A fixed-term tenancy means the lease automatically comes to an end when the term is up. If you are a tenant and you want to stay on after this term, you can do so if your landlord agrees. However, staying on past a fixed term marks a &lsquo;continuing obligation&rsquo; to pay rent. You&rsquo;ll then need to give 3 months notice when you want to leave.  </p>\n\n","alternative_title":"When and how can you end a commercial property lease before the term is up"},"tags":[{"title":"Business Link","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/businesslink.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"legacy_source"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=businesslink","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/businesslink"},"parent":null},{"title":"Business premises and business rates","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/business%2Fpremises-rates.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes leases, renting, planning permission and waste","short_description":"","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Fpremises-rates","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/premises-rates"},"parent":{"title":"Businesses and self-employed","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/renewing-your-commercial-property-lease.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/renewing-your-commercial-property-lease","title":"Renewing your commercial property lease","format":"answer","updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:25:06+00:00"}]},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/energy-performance-certificate-commercial-property.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/energy-performance-certificate-commercial-property","title":"Energy Performance Certificates for your business premises","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-11-06T14:00:35+00:00","details":{"need_id":"B55","business_proposition":true,"description":"Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) for business properties - apply, exemptions, displaying a certificate, fines and penalties","language":"en","alternative_title":"Get an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for your commercial property","video_summary":"","video_url":"","parts":[{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/energy-performance-certificate-commercial-property/overview","slug":"overview","order":1,"title":"Overview","body":"<p>An Energy Performance Certificate (<abbr title=\"Energy Performance Certificate\">EPC</abbr>) rates how energy efficient your building is using grades from A to G (with ‘A’ the most efficient). </p>\n\n<h2>When you must have one</h2>\n\n<p>You must have an <abbr title=\"Energy Performance Certificate\">EPC</abbr> when: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you rent out or sell your business premises</li>\n  <li>a building under construction is finished</li>\n  <li>a building is changed in any way that gives it more or fewer sections <strong>and</strong> those sections are for separate use and heated, air conditioned or mechanically ventilated</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"advisory\"><p><strong>If you don’t make an <abbr title=\"Energy Performance Certificate\">EPC</abbr> available to any prospective buyer or tenant you can be fined up to £5,000.</strong></p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>How much it costs</h2>\n\n<p>The cost of an <abbr title=\"Energy Performance Certificate\">EPC</abbr> is set by the market and market demand.
