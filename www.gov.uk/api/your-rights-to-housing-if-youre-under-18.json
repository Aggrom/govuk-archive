You can be legally homeless if you&rsquo;re staying with friends or another family for a while. You don&rsquo;t have to be sleeping rough to be homeless.</p>\n\n<h2>If you&rsquo;re under 16</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re under 16 and having serious problems at home, contact Children&rsquo;s Services at your local council. They&rsquo;ll try and help you sort things out so you can stay at home. If living at home is too dangerous or impossible, they can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>arrange for you to live with another family member or adult, like a friend’s parent</li>\n  <li>find you emergency accommodation</li>\n  <li>look at other options including living with a <a href=\"/foster-carers\" title=\"Foster carers\">foster family</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>If you&rsquo;re 16 or 17</h2>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you’re under 18, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to sign a tenancy contract or mortgage agreement.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re 16 or 17 and homeless, you&rsquo;ll usually be provided with accommodation by Children&rsquo;s Services at your local council.
