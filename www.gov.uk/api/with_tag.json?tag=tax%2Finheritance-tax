Find out more by reading the information on different <a href=\"/trusts-taxes/types-of-trust\" title=\"types of trust\">types of trust</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What trustees do</h2>\n\n<p>The trustees are the legal owners of the assets held in a trust. Their role is to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deal with the assets according to the trust deed</li>\n  <li>manage the trust on a day-to-day basis and pay any tax due</li>\n  <li>decide how to invest or use the trust&rsquo;s assets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the trustees change, the trust can still continue, but there always has to be at least 1 trustee.</p>\n\n<h2>Beneficiaries</h2>\n\n<p>There might be more than 1 beneficiary, like a whole family or defined group of people. They may benefit from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the income of a trust only - eg from renting out a house held in a trust</li>\n  <li>the capital only - eg getting shares held in a trust when they reach a certain age</li>\n  <li>both the income and capital of the trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/trusts-taxes/types-of-trust","slug":"types-of-trust","order":2,"title":"Types of trust","body":"<p>The main types of trust are listed below - they&rsquo;re all taxed differently.</p>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"/trusts-taxes/overview\" title=\"overview\">overview</a> for definitions of &lsquo;trustee&rsquo;, &lsquo;settlor&rsquo; and &lsquo;beneficiary&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<h2>Bare trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the capital and income of the trust. </p>\n\n<p>Bare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland. </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gary leaves his sister Juliet some money in his will. The money is held in trust. </p>\n\n<p>As the beneficiary Juliet is entitled to the money and any income (eg interest) it earns. She can also take possession of any of the money at any time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Interest in possession trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are trusts where the trustee must pass on all trust income to the beneficiary as it arises (less any expenses). </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stanley creates a trust for all the shares he owned. </p>\n\n<p>The terms of the trust say that when he dies, the income from those shares goes to his wife for the rest of her life. When she dies, the shares will pass to their children.</p>\n\n<p>Stanley&rsquo;s wife is the income beneficiary and has an &lsquo;interest in possession&rsquo; in the trust. She doesn&rsquo;t have a right to the shares themselves.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Discretionary trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the trustees can decide how to use the trust income, and sometimes the capital.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the trust deed, trustees can decide:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>what gets paid out (income or capital)</li>\n  <li>which beneficiary to make payments to</li>\n  <li>how often payments are made</li>\n  <li>any conditions to impose on the beneficiaries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Discretionary trusts are sometimes set up to put assets aside for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a future need, like a grandchild who may need more financial help than other beneficiaries at some point in their life</li>\n  <li>beneficiaries who aren&rsquo;t capable or responsible enough to deal with money themselves</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Accumulation trusts</h2>\n\n<p>This is where the trustees can accumulate income within the trust and add it to the trust&rsquo;s capital. They may also be able to pay income out, as with discretionary trusts.</p>\n\n<h2>Mixed trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are a combination of more than one type of trust. The different parts of the trust are treated according to the tax rules that apply to each part.</p>\n\n<h2>Settlor-interested trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the settlor or their spouse or civil partner benefits from the trust. The trust could be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>an interest in possession trust</li>\n  <li>an accumulation trust</li>\n  <li>a discretionary trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dave can no longer work due to illness. He sets up a discretionary trust to make sure he has money in the future and puts some of his money in it.</p>\n\n<p>He&rsquo;s the settlor, but he may also benefit from the trust because the trustees can make payments to him.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Non-resident trusts</h2>\n\n<p>This is a trust set up or managed by someone living abroad.

With these trusts, all income paid to the spouse or civil partner is treated as though it has already been taxed at 50%. There&rsquo;s no more tax to pay. However, unlike payments made from other types of trusts, the tax credit can&rsquo;t be claimed back.</p>\n\n<h2>Non-resident trusts</h2>\n\n<p>This is a trust set up or managed by someone living abroad.

This affects what&rsquo;s included in the beneficiary&rsquo;s estate when they die. There are 2 main types of trust you might have to deal with.</p>\n\n<h3>Bare trusts</h3>\n\n<p>This is where the beneficiary is entitled to the income and the assets in the trust. When they die, both are counted as part of their estate. </p>\n\n<h3>Interest in possession trusts</h3>\n\n<p>This is where the beneficiary is entitled only to the income from the trust. However, when valuing someone&rsquo;s estate for Inheritance Tax purposes, the value of the capital assets in the trust are added to the value of the person&rsquo;s estate.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Not all income from interest in possession trusts is counted as part of the estate for Inheritance Tax. The trustees will help you work out the value of a trust’s income.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>If the deceased transferred assets into a trust before they died</h2>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to find out whether the person made any transfers in the 7 years before they died. If they did, and they paid 20% Inheritance Tax, you&rsquo;ll need to pay an extra 20% from the estate. </p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Even if no Inheritance Tax was due on the transfer, you still have to add its value to the person’s estate when you’re valuing it for Inheritance Tax purposes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>If the trust is set up by a will</h2>\n\n<p>Someone might ask that some or all of their assets are put into a trust. This is called a &lsquo;will trust&rsquo;. </p>\n\n<p>The personal representative of the deceased person has to make sure that the trust is properly set up with all taxes paid, and the trustees make sure that Inheritance Tax is paid on any future transfers.</p>\n\n<p>Dealing with trusts for Inheritance Tax can be complicated.

You can find their value by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>looking it up yourself - use the closing price on the day the person died (you can find this in the financial pages of the following day&rsquo;s newspapers - libraries have copies of old newspapers)</li>\n  <li>using a professional valuer - if the person owned a lot of shares, you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/tools-and-services/find-a-broker/locate-a-broker-search.html\" title=\"Ask a stockbroker\">ask a stockbroker</a> to do it for you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Work out the total value by multiplying the number of shares by the price per share.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>If the shares changed price over the day</h3>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re given a range of prices, follow the steps in the example below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>The range is 1091p to 1101p and you have to find the total price for 1,000 shares.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>Find the difference between the higher price and the lower price: 1101p - 1091p = 10p.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Work out a quarter of the difference between the 2 prices: 10p x 0.25 = 2.5p.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Add this to the lower price: 1091p + 2.5p = 1093.5p.

Next to this will be a price or percentage to include in your valuation. </p>\n\n<p>You work out the bonus to include in the value of the estate by multiplying the number of shares by the bonus figure per share. </p>\n\n<h3>Interest payments</h3>\n\n<p>Some stocks and shares calculate interest on a daily basis but only pay it once or twice a year. These will have &lsquo;im&rsquo; or &lsquo;ik&rsquo; next to the price. </p>\n\n<p>You need to work out the value from the date the last payment was made until the date of death. This can be complicated - ask a professional valuer to help.</p>\n\n<h2>Unit trusts</h2>\n\n<p>Newspapers don&rsquo;t show the value of these so you need to ask the fund manager.
