If you don&rsquo;t agree, you can be arrested and charged.</p>\n\n<p>A caution is not a criminal conviction, but it could be used as evidence of bad character if you go to court for another crime.</p>\n\n<h2>Conditional cautions</h2>\n\n<p>If you get a conditional caution, you&rsquo;ll have to stick to certain rules and restrictions as part of your caution, eg:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>going for treatment for drug abuse</li>\n  <li>fixing damage to a property</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you donâ€™t stick to the conditions, you could be charged with a crime.</p>\n\n<h2>Cautions for under 18s</h2>\n\n<p>Young people aged 10 to 17 can get cautions called &lsquo;reprimands&rsquo; or &lsquo;warnings&rsquo; for minor offences.</p>\n\n<p>The police will usually tell you off, and give you a &lsquo;reprimand&rsquo;, for a first offence.</p>\n\n<p>They will give you a warning for a second offence, and tell you that you&rsquo;ll be charged if you commit another crime. </p>\n\n<h2>Penalty notices for disorder</h2>\n\n<p>Penalty notices for disorder are given for offences like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>shoplifting</li>\n  <li>possessing cannabis</li>\n  <li>being drunk and disorderly in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll be asked to sign the penalty notice ticket. If you pay the penalty then you won&rsquo;t get a criminal conviction.</p>\n\n<p>You can ask for a trial if you disagree with the penalty notice. If you don&rsquo;t pay the fine or ask for a trial, you&rsquo;ll be given a larger fine.</p>\n"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:13:38+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Your rights and the law","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/justice%2Frights.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes being arrested, cautions, discrimination and consumer rights","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=justice%2Frights","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/justice/rights"},"parent":{"title":"Crime, justice and the law","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/justice.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Legal processes, courts and the police","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=justice","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/justice"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/police-powers-of-arrest-your-rights.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/police-powers-of-arrest-your-rights","title":"Police powers of arrest: your rights","format":"answer","details":{"need_id":"1578","business_proposition":false,"description":"The police's power of arrest and your rights - procedures, identification, reasonable force"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:20:39+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/age-of-criminal-responsibility.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/age-of-criminal-responsibility","title":"What is the age of criminal responsibility?","format":"answer","details":{"need_id":"2011","business_proposition":false,"description":"The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10 years old.
