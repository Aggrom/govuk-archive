Invoice financiers can be independent, or part of a bank or financial institution.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of invoice financing in the UK.</p>\n\n<h2>Factoring</h2>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Factoring&rsquo; usually involves an invoice financier managing your sales ledger and collecting money owed by your customers themselves. This means your customers will know you&rsquo;re using invoice finance.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>When you raise an invoice, the invoice financier will buy the debt owed to you by your customer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They make a percentage of the cost (usually around 85%) available to you upfront.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They then collect the full amount directly from your customer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Once theyâ€™ve received the money from your customer, they make the remaining balance available to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Youâ€™ll have to them pay a discount charge (interest) and fees - the amount depends on which invoice financier you use.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br />\nYou&rsquo;re owed Â£40,000 by a customer. You sell the invoice to an invoice financier for Â£34,000 (85%). They collect Â£40,000 from your customer and pay you the remaining Â£6,000 when they receive the money. You pay them interest and any fees you owe.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Invoice discounting</h2>\n\n<p>With &lsquo;invoice discounting&rsquo;, the invoice financier won&rsquo;t manage your sales ledger or collect debts on your behalf. Instead, they lend you money against your unpaid invoices - this is usually an agreed percentage of their total value. You&rsquo;ll have to pay them a fee.</p>\n\n<p>As your customers pay their invoices, the money goes to the invoice financier. This reduces the amount you owe, which means you can then borrow more money on invoices from new sales up to the percentage you originally agreed.</p>\n\n<p>If you use invoice discounting you&rsquo;ll still be responsible for collecting debts, but it can be arranged confidentially so your customers won&rsquo;t find out.</p>\n\n<h2>Advantages</h2>\n\n<p>Both kinds of invoice financing can provide a large and quick boost to your cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>Specific advantages of factoring include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the invoice financier will look after your sales ledger, freeing up your time to manage your business</li>\n  <li>they can help you to negotiate better terms with your suppliers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Specific advantages of invoice discounting include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>it can be arranged confidentially, so your customers won&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re borrowing against their invoices</li>\n  <li>it lets you maintain closer relationships with your customers, because you&rsquo;re still managing their accounts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>\n\n<p>Some disadvantages of invoice financing are that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>youâ€™ll lose profit from orders or services that you provide</li>\n  <li>invoice financiers will usually only buy commercial invoices -

You might choose to focus on customers who&rsquo;ve already bought from you, or you could try to <a href=\"/growing-your-business/attract-new-customers\" title=\"Attract new customers\">win new customers</a> in your local area, nationally or overseas.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest way to increase your sales is to sell more of the products or services you&rsquo;re selling at the moment to the customers who are already buying them. For most businesses this involves:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>persuading one-off customers to become repeat customers</li>\n  <li>finding customers who&rsquo;ve stopped buying from you and trying to win them back</li>\n  <li>selling more of the same products or services to your regular customers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By keeping a record of who your customers are and what you sold to them, you can work out who&rsquo;s stopped buying from you, and who might consider buying more. Targeting these customers is often a cheaper and more effective way to increase sales than trying to find new ones.</p>\n\n<h2>Review your prices</h2>\n\n<p>Regularly reviewing your prices and checking them against your competitors can be an effective way of increasing your sales, profits or both.</p>\n\n<p>You should try to estimate the likely effect of different price changes on the sales, cash flow and profitability of your business before making any changes. To do this successfully, you need to understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the &lsquo;cost structure&rsquo; of your business (including regular &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; costs, and &lsquo;variable&rsquo; costs that change according to your business&rsquo; activity)</li>\n  <li>the value your customers place on your products and services</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Watch a video on <a href=\"/avoid-business-cashflow-problems\" title=\"Avoid business cash flow problems\">dealing with cash flow problems</a>, including handling late payments.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind that offering a discount can sometimes reduce your overall profitability, even if your sales go up. Equally, you might be able to make more profit overall by increasing prices, even if you&rsquo;re selling fewer items. </p>\n\n<p>Small changes to pricing like providing loyalty schemes or bulk discounts can increase sales to both existing and former customers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>A car wash offers free cleaning every tenth visit if customers opt for the deluxe service. Even though they&rsquo;re giving something away for free, the value of repeat business from loyal customers means that profits go up.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s likely that it would&rsquo;ve cost significantly more to generate the same amount of sales with new customers, resulting in less profit.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You should also regularly check the price you&rsquo;re selling products and services at against competitors. This will help you find out if youâ€™re:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>losing customers who get the same product or service elsewhere for less money</li>\n  <li>sacrificing profitability, because customers are willing to pay more than youâ€™re charging them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Find resources on <a href=\"http://www.marketingdonut.co.uk/marketing/marketing-strategy/pricing\" title=\"Pricing\" rel=\"external\">pricing strategy</a> and increasing <a href=\"http://www.marketingdonut.co.uk/marketing/sales\" title=\"Sales and distribution\" rel=\"external\">sales</a> on the Marketing Donut website.</p>\n</div>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/growing-your-business/attract-new-customers","slug":"attract-new-customers","order":3,"title":"Attract new customers","body":"<p>One way of finding new customers for your products and services is by increasing awareness in your local area.
