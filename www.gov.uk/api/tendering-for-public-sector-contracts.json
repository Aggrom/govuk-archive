These are then evaluated and the contract is awarded. This procedure is often used by local councils.</p>\n\n<h3>The restricted procedure</h3>\n\n<p>This is a 2-stage process. In the first stage, interested suppliers are asked to fill out a questionnaire and a short-list is drawn up. In the second stage, the shortlisted suppliers are invited to respond to an Invitation to Tender (<abbr title=\"Invitation to Tender\">ITT</abbr>). The tenders are then evaluated and the contract awarded.</p>\n\n<h3>The competitive dialogue procedure</h3>\n\n<p>This procedure is used for more complex procurements. After a selection process, the buyer then negotiates with suppliers and invites chosen companies to put in a bid. Suppliers put in their tenders and the contract is awarded.</p>\n\n<h3>The negotiated procedure</h3>\n\n<p>In this procedure, the buyer enters into contract negotiations with one or more suppliers.</p>\n\n<h2>Framework agreements</h2>\n\n<p>If a public sector organisation knows they are likely to need particular goods or services, but are unsure about exactly what they&rsquo;ll need or when, they may decide to set up a group of approved suppliers that they can use when necessary. This is called a &lsquo;framework agreement&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>The organisation will invite potential suppliers to put themselves forward for the framework and choose the one(s) most able to do the work. Once the framework is set up, individual contracts are made throughout the period of the agreement. If there&rsquo;s more than one possible supplier on the framework, a &lsquo;mini-competition&rsquo; may be held to decide who gets the contract.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Framework agreements usually last for a maximum of 4 years.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Further information on procurement rules and procedures</h2>\n\n<p>Find more information on UK government procurement procedures on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/i-am-supplier\" title=\"Government Procurement Service supplier information\">Government Procurement Service (<abbr title=\"Government Procurement Service\">GPS</abbr>) website</a> </p>\n\n<p>Find more information about EU procurement rules on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.publicprocurementnetwork.org/\" title=\"Public Procurement Network\">Public Procurement Network website.</a> </p>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/tendering-for-public-sector-contracts/the-tendering-process","slug":"the-tendering-process","order":5,"title":"The tendering process","body":"<h2>Tendering for a contract</h2>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>Once you’ve found a contract you might want to bid for, read it carefully to decide whether your business can do the work.
