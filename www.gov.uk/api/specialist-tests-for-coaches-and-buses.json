The certificate reduces the cost of the vehicle excise duty (commonly known as road tax).</p>\n\n<p>Some RPCs also mean you can drive the vehicle in the Low Emission Zone (<abbr title=\"Low Emission Zone\">LEZ</abbr>) without charge. The <abbr title=\"Low Emission Zone\">LEZ</abbr> covers most of Greater London and heavy diesel vehicles are charged to enter the area.</p>\n\n<p>Some vehicles that don’t qualify for an <abbr title=\"Reduced Pollution Certificate\">RPC</abbr> can still get a Low Emissions Certificate (<abbr title=\"Lower Emissions Certificate\">LEC</abbr>) – this means they can be driven in the <abbr title=\"Low Emission Zone\">LEZ</abbr> without charge, but their road tax will stay the same.</p>\n\n<p>You can have the tests done as part of your annual test, or separately.

Your bus or coach qualifies if it was registered in Great Britain before 1 October 2006 and has been fitted with a full flow particulate filter approved by Transport for London (<abbr title=\"Transport for London\">TfL</abbr>).</p>\n\n<h2>What happens at the test</h2>\n\n<p>The tests for both the <abbr title=\"Reduced Pollution Certificate\">RPC</abbr> and the <abbr title=\"Lower Emissions Certificate\">LEC</abbr> are in 2 parts. There is a physical inspection to check any modifications, like a filter fitted to the exhaust, and then a ‘smoke opacity test’ to check emissions.</p>\n\n<p>If the vehicle passes both parts of one of the tests, <abbr title=\"Vehicle and Operator Services Agency\">VOSA</abbr> will issue you with either an <abbr title=\"Reduced Pollution Certificate\">RPC</abbr> or an <abbr title=\"Lower Emissions Certificate\">LEC</abbr>. If your vehicle is registered in Great Britain, these details are then automatically passed to <abbr title=\"Transport for London\">TfL</abbr> by <abbr title=\"Vehicle and Operator Services Agency\">VOSA</abbr> so you can use the vehicle in the Low Emission Zone.</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle is registered outside Great Britain, you need to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/lez/17702.aspx#tkt-tab-panel-4\" title=\"register your certificate with TfL\">register your certificate with <abbr title=\"Transport for London\">TfL</abbr></a> yourself.</p>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/specialist-tests-for-coaches-and-buses/booking-and-fees-for-rpc-and-lec-tests","slug":"booking-and-fees-for-rpc-and-lec-tests","order":3,"title":"Booking and fees for RPC and LEC tests","body":"<p>Part 4 \nThe table uses acronyms not explained the 1st time used</p>\n\n<p>To book your test, call the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title=\"Vehicle and Operator Services Agency\">VOSA</abbr>) Helpline.
