You must give your tenants at least 24 hours&rsquo; notice, although immediate access may be possible in emergencies. Your tenants have the right to stay in the property during the repairs.</p>\n\n<p>If your property is seriously damaged by a fire, flood or other similar incident, you don&rsquo;t have to rebuild or renovate it. However, if you do, you can&rsquo;t charge your tenants for any repairs made.</p>\n\n<h2>Common areas</h2>\n\n<p>If you own a block of flats, you&rsquo;ll usually be responsible for repairing common areas, like staircases.
