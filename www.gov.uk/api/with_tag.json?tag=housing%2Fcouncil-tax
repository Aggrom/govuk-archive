If this means you&rsquo;re struggling to pay your bills, you can ask your council if they&rsquo;re willing to accept smaller payments.</p>\n\n<h3>Deductions from benefits</h3>\n<p>Your council may be able to apply to have money deducted from your benefits, like Jobseekers’ Allowance, Income Support or Pension Credit.</p>\n\n<h3>Bailiffs</h3>\n<p>Your council can send bailiffs to your home to seize property to sell. Your council must write to you 2 weeks before the bailiff’s first visit saying how much you owe.</p>\n\n<p>You can contact the council and the bailiffs and try to agree a payment plan. However, if the bailiffs visit you their costs could be added to your bill.</p>\n\n<h3>Prison</h3>\n<p>If your council has tried using bailiffs but your bill still isn&rsquo;t paid, they can apply to the Magistrates’ Court for a warrant to send you to prison. </p>\n\n<p>The court must hold an enquiry with you present. This is to find out if you can afford to pay the bill. If the court doesn&rsquo;t think you have a valid reason for not paying, it can send you to prison for up to 3 months.</p>\n\n<p>The court may decide to postpone imprisonment on certain conditions, like you agreeing to repay the debt over time. The court can also cancel all or part of the debt. </p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>The longer you ignore a debt problem, the worse the situation becomes.</p>\n</div>\n\n","alternative_title":""},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:19:26+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Council Tax","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing%2Fcouncil-tax.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes bands, arrears, appeals and Council Tax Benefit","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing%2Fcouncil-tax","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing/council-tax"},"parent":{"title":"Housing and local services","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Your legal obligations and rights when renting, buying or owning a home, plus information about Council Tax, what to do if you're homeless and where to get help if you have a housing dispute.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/council-tax-benefit.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-benefit","title":"Council Tax Benefit","format":"programme","details":{"need_id":"50","business_proposition":false,"description":"Council Tax Benefit is money off your Council Tax bill -
