But shareholders may have to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/taxon/uk.htm\" title=\"Tax on UK dividends\">pay tax on it.</a></p>\n\n<h3>Working out the dividend tax credit</h3>\n\n<p>To work out the dividend tax credit, divide the dividend amount by 9.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>You want to pay a dividend of £900. Divide £900 by 9, which gives you a dividend tax credit of £100. Pay £900 to the shareholder - but add the £100 tax credit and record a total of £1,000 on the dividend voucher.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You must give a copy of the voucher to recipients of the dividend and keep a copy for your company&rsquo;s records.</p>\n\n<h2>Directors’ loans</h2>\n\n<p>If you take more money out of a company than you&rsquo;ve put in - and it isn&rsquo;t salary or dividend  - it’s called a ‘directors’ loan.’</p>\n\n<p>If your company makes directors’ loans, you must keep records of them.
