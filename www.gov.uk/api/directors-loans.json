Your company should pay you the interest but withhold the Income Tax at the basic rate of 20%. You must report the income on your <a href=\"/self-assessment-tax-returns\" title=\"Self Assessment Tax Returns\">Self Assessment tax return</a>.</p>\n\n","alternative_title":""},"tags":[{"title":"Running a limited company","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/business%2Flimited-company.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes registering, setting up, company accounts and tax returns","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Flimited-company","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/limited-company"},"parent":{"title":"Businesses and self-employed","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Business Link","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/businesslink.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":null,"short_description":null,"type":"legacy_source"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=businesslink","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/businesslink"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/running-a-limited-company.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company","title":"Running a limited company","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-11-26T14:41:46+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees","title":"Expenses and benefits: loans provided to employees","format":"guide","updated_at":"2012-10-24T11:59:16+00:00"}]}
