This is calculated by multiplying a normal week (5 days) by the annual entitlement of 5.6 weeks.  </p>\n\n<h2>Working part-time</h2>\n\n<p>Part-time workers are also entitled to a minimum of 5.6 weeks of paid holiday each year, although this may amount to fewer actual days of paid holiday than a full-time worker would get.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br />\nA worker works 3 days a week, their leave is calculated by multiplying 3 by 5.6 which comes to 16.8 days of annual paid leave.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Irregular hours</h2>\n\n<p>If someone works irregular hours - eg shift work - they need to <a href=\"/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement\" title=\"Calculate your holiday entitlement\">calculate their leave entitlement for irregular hours</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Limits on statutory leave</h2>\n\n<p>The maximum amount of paid statutory leave a worker can have over one leave year is 28 days.

An employer can choose to include these holidays as part of a worker&rsquo;s statutory annual leave.</p>\n\n<h2>Extra leave</h2>\n\n<p>An employer can choose to offer more leave than the legal minimum. They don&rsquo;t have to apply all the rules that apply to statutory leave to the extra leave.
