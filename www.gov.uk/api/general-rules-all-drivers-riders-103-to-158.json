For example, if the rear of the vehicle skids to the right, steer immediately to the right to recover.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/static/hc/hc_rule_119_rear_of_the_car_skids_to_the_right_driver_steers_to_the_right.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Highway Code - Rule 119 Rear Of The Car Skids To The Right Driver Steers To The Right\" /></p>\n\n<h2>120</h2>\n\n<p><strong>ABS.</strong> If your vehicle is fitted with anti-lock brakes, you should follow the advice given in the vehicle handbook. However, in the case of an emergency, apply the footbrake firmly; do not release the pressure until the vehicle has slowed to the desired speed. The ABS should ensure that steering control will be retained, but do not assume that a vehicle with ABS will stop in a shorter distance.</p>\n\n<h2>121</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Brakes affected by water.</strong> If you have driven through deep water your brakes may be less effective. Test them at the first safe opportunity by pushing gently on the brake pedal to make sure that they work. If they are not fully effective, gently apply light pressure while driving slowly. This will help to dry them out.</p>\n\n<h2>122</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Coasting.</strong> This term describes a vehicle travelling in neutral or with the clutch pressed down.

Never use a hand-held microphone when driving. Using hands-free equipment is also likely to distract your attention from the road. It is far safer not to use any telephone while you are driving or riding - find a safe place to stop first or use the voicemail facility and listen to messages later.<br />\n<strong>Laws RTA 1988 sects 2 &amp; 3 &amp; CUR regs 104 &amp; 110</strong></p>\n\n<h2>150</h2>\n<p>There is a danger of driver distraction being caused by in-vehicle systems such as satellite navigation systems, congestion warning systems, PCs, multi-media, etc. You <strong>MUST</strong> exercise proper control of your vehicle at all times. Do not rely on driver assistance systems such as cruise control or lane departure warnings. They are available to assist but you should not reduce your concentration levels. Do not be distracted by maps or screen-based information (such as navigation or vehicle management systems) while driving or riding.

Be prepared for pedestrians, horse riders, cyclists, slow-moving farm vehicles or mud on the road surface. Make sure you can stop within the distance you can see to be clear. You should also reduce your speed where country roads enter villages.</p>\n\n<h2>155</h2>\n<p><strong>Single-track roads.</strong> These are only wide enough for one vehicle. They may have special passing places. If you see a vehicle coming towards you, or the driver behind wants to overtake, pull into a passing place on your left, or wait opposite a passing place on your right. Give way to vehicles coming uphill whenever you can. If necessary, reverse until you reach a passing place to let the other vehicle pass. Slow down when passing pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders.</p>\n\n<h2>156</h2>\n\n<p>Do not park in passing places.</p>\n\n<h2>Vehicles prohibited from using roads and pavements</h2>\n\n<h2>157</h2>\n\n<p>Certain motorised vehicles do not meet the construction and technical requirements for road vehicles and are generally not intended, not suitable and not legal for road, pavement, footpath, cycle path or bridleway use.
