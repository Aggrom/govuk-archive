When you retire you arrange payments through an insurance company, or in some cases through your pension provider.

This is a contract between you and an insurance company. You hand over all or part of your pension fund to them and they give you regular payments until you die. </p>\n\n<p>The amount of the regular pension payments under your annuity depends on how long the insurance company expects you to live and how many years they&rsquo;ll have to pay you. </p>\n\n<p>To calculate your annuity they could take into account:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your age </li>\n  <li>your gender </li>\n  <li>the size of your pension fund </li>\n  <li>interest rates </li>\n  <li>sometimes your health </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to buy your annuity from your pension provider.

government also add money into the pension scheme for you.</p>\n\n<p>The money is used to pay you an income for the rest of your life when you start getting the pension.</p>\n\n<p>You can usually take some of your workplace pension as a tax-free lump sum when you retire. </p>\n\n<p>If the amount of money you’ve saved is quite small, you may be able to take it all as a lump sum - but if you pay Income Tax, you&rsquo;ll have to pay tax on the lump sum.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>You can’t usually take the money out before you’re 55 at the earliest - unless <a

easier for you financially when you’re retired.</p>\n\n<h2>&lsquo;Automatic enrolment&rsquo;</h2>\n\n<p>A new law means that every employer must automatically enrol workers into a workplace pension scheme if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>are aged between 22 and State Pension age</li>\n  <li>earn more than £8,105 a year</li>\n  <li>work in the UK</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is called &lsquo;automatic

They promise to give you a certain amount each year when you retire. This amount is fixed - it doesn&rsquo;t depend on investments. </p>\n\n<p>The amount you&rsquo;ll get depends on your salary and on how long you&rsquo;ve worked for your employer.
