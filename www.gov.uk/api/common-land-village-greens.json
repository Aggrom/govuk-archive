The &lsquo;right to roam&rsquo; on common land means you can use it for activities like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>walking</li>\n  <li>sightseeing</li>\n  <li>bird watching</li>\n  <li>picnicking</li>\n  <li>climbing</li>\n  <li>running</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can&rsquo;t:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>camp on common land without the owner&rsquo;s permission</li>\n  <li>light a fire or have a barbecue</li>\n  <li>hold a festival or other event without permission</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Common land is a type of <a href=\"/right-of-way-open-access-land/open-access-land\" title=\"Open access land\">Access Land</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Town and village greens</h2>\n<p>You can use town and village greens for sports and recreation. Some also have &lsquo;rights of common&rsquo; over them - like grazing livestock. The right to roam doesn&rsquo;t apply to town and village greens.</p>\n\n<p>Many greens are owned and maintained by local parish or community councils. Some are privately owned. </p>\n\n<h2>Common land and village greens near you</h2>\n<p>Find out where your local common land or village green is by contacting <a href=\"/find-your-local-park\" title=\"Find your local park\">your local council.</a> It keeps the &lsquo;Register of Common Land and Village Greens&rsquo; for your area. </p>\n\n<p>Each entry in the register contains information like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a description of the land</li>\n  <li>who has rights to use it, and what those rights are</li>\n  <li>who owns it, or who owned it when it was first registered</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>If you own common land</h2>\n<p>The management of common land must take into account the interests of both the owner and the &lsquo;commoners&rsquo; (people who have rights over the land but don&rsquo;t own it). This can be done:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>by the landowner</li>\n  <li>informally by landowners and those with rights on the land working together - for example to keep the land maintained and not over- or under-grazed</li>\n  <li>formally by setting up a statutory <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/farming/commonland/commoncouncils.aspx\" title=\"Commons Councils (Natural England)\">commons council</a> - the stakeholders sit on the council, make decisions by voting and the decisions of the council are legally binding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Cross compliance and common land</h3>\n<p>As a landowner, if you claim agricultural payments under the Single Payment Scheme, you must comply with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/814240C66F10CAC8802570C7004248D4?Opendocument\" title=\"Cross compliance\">cross compliance</a> rules across all of your agricultural land - not just the land that you claim payments for. </p>\n\n<p>The responsibility for cross compliance with common land is shared with the other stakeholders. If the other stakeholders are actively using the land, setting up a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/farming/commonland/commoncouncils.aspx\" title=\"Commons Councils (Natural England)\">commons council</a> can help with meeting cross compliance rules.</p>\n","alternative_title":""},"updated_at":"2012-10-23T14:21:39+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Safety and the environment in your community","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing%2Fsafety-environment.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes waste, rubbish and recycling, noise pollution and local emergencies","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing%2Fsafety-environment","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing/safety-environment"},"parent":{"title":"Housing and local services","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/housing.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Your legal obligations and rights when renting, buying or owning a home, plus information about Council Tax, what to do if you're homeless and where to get help if you have a housing dispute.","short_description":null,"type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=housing","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/housing"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/right-of-way-open-access-land.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/right-of-way-open-access-land","title":"Right of way and open access land","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"604","business_proposition":false,"description":"Public rights of way are roads, paths or tracks that are open to everyone - open access land, what to do if your access is blocked and land with no right of way"},"updated_at":"2012-10-23T14:22:10+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/find-your-local-park.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-park","title":"Find your local park","format":"local_transaction","details":{"need_id":"2135","business_proposition":false,"description":"Information about parks and open spaces near you, including playgrounds, nature reserves, wildlife sites and sports pitches"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:13:51+00:00"}]}
