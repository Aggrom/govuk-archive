You can have a relative, accountant or legal adviser with you if you want.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>You don’t have to agree to meet <abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr> but it may mean your check is completed sooner.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr> will tell you which records they want to see and give you what they think is a reasonable time to send them.

You can ask an adviser to help you at any time. You&rsquo;re still responsible for your tax if you use an adviser.</p>\n\n<h2>Delaying, postponing or stopping a check</h2>\n\n<p>You can ask <abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr> to delay or postpone a check for reasons like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you&rsquo;re seriously ill</li>\n  <li>someone close to you has died</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you think <abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr> should stop the check for any reason, write to the office that sent you the letter and explain why.
