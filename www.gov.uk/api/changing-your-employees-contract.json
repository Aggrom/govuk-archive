You must tell them exactly what has changed in the statement. </p>\n\n<p>If you change terms and conditions that aren&rsquo;t in the written statement (eg like the right to sick leave), you should tell employees where to find information about the change (eg company handbook, noticeboard or intranet site). </p>\n\n<h2>Collective agreements and changes to written statements</h2>\n<p>You may have a <a href=\"/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements\" title=\"Collective agreements\">collective agreement</a> with trade unions or a staff association. If you make agreed changes to the terms of the collective agreement, you should inform employees in writing.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiations under a collective agreement can lead to changes in the terms of an employee&rsquo;s written statement. If an employee is covered by a collective agreement, any changes will apply to them whether or not they are members of a union or staff association.</p>\n\n<h2>Flexibility clauses</h2>\n<p>These are terms in your employees&rsquo; contract that give you the right to change some terms and conditions. An example of a flexibility clause could be that an employee&rsquo;s job location can be changed. </p>\n\n<p>You aren&rsquo;t allowed to make completely unreasonable changes using a flexibility clause. </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br />\nTelling an employee to move to another country at one day&rsquo;s notice would be completely unreasonable.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Changes of employer</h2>\n<p>If there&rsquo;s a change of employer, all employees must usually be given a new written statement within 2 months.</p>\n\n<p>If the name of the business changes or there&rsquo;s a new employer but no other changes in terms and conditions, you don&rsquo;t need to issue a new written statement. However, you should inform employees in writing of the change within a month.</p>\n\n<h2>Disciplinary measures</h2>\n<p>Sometimes changes to an employee&rsquo;s terms and conditions like a demotion can happen as a result of a disciplinary measure. </p>\n\n<p>The staff handbook or intranet site should contain information about how this could happen in the section dealing with disciplinary procedures.</p>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/changing-your-employees-contract/making-changes-without-agreement","slug":"making-changes-without-agreement","order":3,"title":"Making changes without agreement","body":"<p>If you make a change to contracts without employees&rsquo; agreement (including by using flexibility clauses unreasonably), they may:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have the right to refuse to work under the new conditions </li>\n  <li>say they are working under any new terms under protest and they&rsquo;re treating the change as a breach of contract</li>\n  <li>resign and claim constructive dismissal</li>\n  <li>take a case to an employment tribunal (or an industrial tribunal in Northern Ireland)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Working new terms and conditions</h2>\n<p>If an employee disagrees with new terms and conditions but doesn&rsquo;t say or do anything, this may count as agreeing the changes. </p>\n\n<h2>Re-employment on new terms and conditions</h2>\n<p>If there&rsquo;s no agreement, as a last resort an employer can sometimes end employees&rsquo; contracts and re-employ them on new terms and conditions.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you’re <a href=\"/dismissing-staff/fair-dismissals\" title=\"dismissing staff\">dismissing staff</a> you must do so fairly.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you do dismiss and re-employ employees, they may take a case to a tribunal and claim:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>breach of contract</li>\n  <li>unfair dismissal</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/changing-your-employees-contract/problems-with-changes","slug":"problems-with-changes","order":4,"title":"Problems with changes","body":"<p>Problems can arise if: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>an employer tries to change an employee&rsquo;s contract without agreement or re-employs them on new terms and conditions</li>\n  <li>there&rsquo;s a breach of contract where one of the terms in a contract is broken (eg an employer doesn&rsquo;t pay agreed wages or employees don&rsquo;t work agreed hours)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Talk to your employees</h2>\n<p>If there&rsquo;s a problem over contract changes, try to solve things informally with your employees.

It&rsquo;s important to get advice first because legal action can be expensive. </p>\n\n<h2>Breach of contract claims</h2>\n<p>An employee can take a breach of contract case to a civil court or an employment tribunal. If an employee goes to an employment tribunal (industrial tribunal in Northern Ireland) you may be able to make a counter-claim. </p>\n\n<p>Claims and counter-claims can only go to a tribunal if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>are related to an employment contract issue</li>\n  <li>still haven&rsquo;t been solved when the employee ends their employment with your company</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The claim or counter-claim also mustn&rsquo;t be related to a personal injury or things like a contract term that deals with <a href=\"/intellectual-property-an-overview/what-is-intellectual-property\" title=\"What is intellectual property\">intellectual property rights.</a> </p>\n\n<h3>Time limits</h3>\n<p>Usually an employee must make a claim to a tribunal within 3 months of ending their employment at your company. You must make a counter-claim within 6 weeks of receiving a copy of the employee&rsquo;s claim. </p>\n\n<h3>Compensation limits</h3>\n<p>If an employment or industrial tribunal agrees with a claim, they may award an employee compensation.</p>\n\n<p>An employee can only get compensation for financial loss (eg non-payment of wages) in a breach of contract case. The maximum that can be given is £25,000.</p>\n\n"}]},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:24:33+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Contracts of employment and working hours","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people%2Fcontracts.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes types of worker, employee rights, overtime and changes to contracts","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people%2Fcontracts","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people/contracts"},"parent":{"title":"Employing people","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/employing-people.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes pay, contracts and hiring","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=employing-people","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/employing-people"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/being-taken-to-employment-tribunal-by-employee.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/being-taken-to-employment-tribunal-by-employee","title":"Being taken to an employment tribunal by an employee","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"B80","business_proposition":true},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:24:18+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/handling-employee-grievance.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/handling-employee-grievance","title":"Handling an employee's grievance","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"B156","business_proposition":true},"updated_at":"2012-10-13T19:25:11+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/your-employment-contract-how-it-can-be-changed.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/your-employment-contract-how-it-can-be-changed","title":"Your employment contract:  how it can be changed","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"B177","business_proposition":false},"updated_at":"2012-10-14T14:29:14+00:00"}]}
