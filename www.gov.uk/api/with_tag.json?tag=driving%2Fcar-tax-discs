includes the body and all parts normally used with the vehicle or trailer when it’s used on a road.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t include the weight of the fuel or, if it’s an electric vehicle, the batteries.</p>\n\n<h2>Maximum authorised mass</h2>\n\n<p>Maximum authorised mass (<abbr title=\"Maximum Authorised Mass\">MAM</abbr>) means the weight of a vehicle or trailer including the maximum load that can be carried safely when it’s being used on the road. </p>\n\n<p>This is also known as gross vehicle weight (<abbr title=\"Gross Vehicle Weight\">GVW</abbr>) or permissible maximum weight.</p>\n\n<p>It will be listed in the owner’s manual and is normally shown on a plate or sticker fitted to the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>The plate or sticker may also show a gross train weight (<abbr title=\"Gross Train Weight\">GTW</abbr>), also sometimes called gross combination weight (<abbr title=\"Gross Combination Weight\">GCW</abbr>). This is the total weight of the tractor unit plus trailer plus load.</p>\n\n<h2>Down-plating</h2>\n\n<p>If a vehicle is unlikely to be used at its potential maximum weight, it may be ‘down-plated’.
