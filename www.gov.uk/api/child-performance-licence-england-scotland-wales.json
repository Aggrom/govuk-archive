work as part of a public performance, sporting event or modelling assignment.</p>\n","licence_overview":"<p>You need a licence from your local authority to pay a child to work at: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a public performance (such as film, play or musical)</li>\n  <li>a sporting event</li>\n  <li>a modelling assignment that you are organising and for which the child will be paid</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A public performance includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>any show for which an admission fee or other charge is made</li>\n  <li>any show which takes place on licensed premises</li>\n  <li>any production which is being filmed, broadcast or recorded for public exhibition</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A child includes any person who has not yet reached compulsory school leaving age.</p>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need a licence if the child is not being paid to take part in the performance, eg in the case of a school play.</p>\n\n<p>You will usually need to complete an application form providing details of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your business</li>\n  <li>the production, sporting event or modelling assignment and the child&rsquo;s part in it</li>\n  <li>times, dates and duration of performances or activities</li>\n  <li>number of days and hours per day that the child will appear in the performances or activities (including rehearsals)</li>\n  <li>what the child will earn</li>\n  <li>arrangements that you will make for the child in relation to, eg schooling and chaperoning</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will also need to provide:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a statement by the child&rsquo;s parents in support of the application (this may be part of the application form)</li>\n  <li>the child&rsquo;s birth certificate or other evidence of age</li>\n  <li>two identical prints of a photograph of the child taken during the previous six months</li>\n  <li>a copy of the contract, draft contract or other documents containing details of the agreement regulating the child&rsquo;s appearance in the performance or the activity for which the licence is required</li>\n  <li>a letter from the child&rsquo;s school authorising their absence</li>\n  <li>a declaration, where the child is under 14 years of age, that the part they are acting or dancing can only be taken by a child of approximately the same age</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An application fee is generally not payable.</p>\n\n<p>You should apply at least 21 days before the performance or activity is due to start.</p>\n\n<p>The local authority may interview you, the child and the child&rsquo;s parents during the process of determining your application and may request that the child is medically examined to ensure they are fit to participate.</p>\n\n<p>If your application is granted, you will be issued a licence specifying the arrangements for the child to take part in the performance or activity.</p>\n\n<h2>Conditions</h2>\n\n<p>Licences will be subject to a number of conditions.</p>\n\n<p>For example:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the number of days the child can be expected to perform </li>\n  <li>getting a matron/chaperone and for the child&rsquo;s education during the term of the licence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Premises where performances or rehearsals are to take place must be approved by the local authority to ensure they are suitable for children.</p>\n\n<p>You will also be required to keep detailed records relating to the performance or activity and produce these for inspection on request.</p>\n\n<h2>Fines and penalties</h2>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>If you allow a child to take part in an unlicensed performance, or fail to comply with any conditions attached to your licence, you are committing an offence and may be fined up to Â£1,000, imprisoned for up to three months or both.</p>\n</div>\n"},"updated_at":"2012-10-22T15:23:13+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Recruiting and
