This is a sliding-scale reduction on your company&rsquo;s tax bill. It means that the Corporation Tax rate rises gradually for profits between £300,000 and £1.5 million.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Work out your Corporation Tax using <abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr>’s <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/calcs/mrr.htm\" title=\"Marginal Relief calculator\" rel=\"external\">Marginal Relief calculator.</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You claim Marginal Relief when you <a href=\"/file-your-company-accounts-and-tax-return\" title=\"How you file your company accounts and tax return\">send your Company Tax Return</a> to <abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h2>Profits above £1.5 million</h2>\n\n<p>Your company pays the main rate on profits over £1.5 million. There is no Marginal Relief.</p>\n\n<h3>If your accounting period involves a change of Corporation Tax rate</h3>\n\n<p>Work out how many days each rate applied, then work out the tax due for each. For example, if your accounting period is 1 March 2012 to 28 February 2013, you pay:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the 2010-11 rate for 31 days (1 March to March 31) </li>\n  <li>the 2011-12 rate for 334 days (from 1 April to 29 February)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>If your accounting period is shorter than 12 months</h3>\n\n<p>The thresholds of £300,000 and £1.5 million are for a whole year, so these are reduced in line with your accounting period. For example, if your accounting period is 6 months, the £300,000 threshold is halved to £150,000.</p>\n\n<h3>Associated companies</h3>\n\n<p>Associated companies (where one company controls others) share thresholds. For example, if 1 company owns 5 others, divide the thresholds by 6 when working out the Corporation Tax for each company.</p>\n\n<h3>Ring fence companies</h3>\n<p>There are <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/corp.htm\" title=\"Corporation Tax rates\">different rates for ring fence companies</a> (companies involved in oil extraction or oil rights in the UK or UK continental shelf).</p>\n\n"},"updated_at":"2012-10-16T18:37:48+00:00","tags":[{"title":"Business Link","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/businesslink.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":null,"type":"legacy_source"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=businesslink","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/businesslink"},"parent":null},{"title":"Business tax","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/business%2Fbusiness-tax.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes Corporation Tax, Self Assessment, Capital Gains Tax and VAT","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Fbusiness-tax","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/business-tax"},"parent":{"title":"Businesses and self-employed","id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}}],"related":[{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company","title":"Accounts and tax returns for private limited companies","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"B133","business_proposition":true,"description":"Statutory and abbreviated annual accounts, Company Tax Returns, paying Corporation Tax, corrections, amendments and dealing with losses"},"updated_at":"2012-10-17T10:57:43+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/file-your-company-accounts-and-tax-return.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/file-your-company-accounts-and-tax-return","title":"File your company accounts and tax return","format":"transaction","details":{"need_id":"B160","business_proposition":true,"description":"File a limited company's annual accounts with Companies House and the Company Tax Return with HMRC"},"updated_at":"2012-10-16T10:27:30+00:00"},{"id":"https://www.gov.uk/api/running-a-limited-company.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company","title":"Running a limited company","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"B162","business_proposition":true,"description":"Running a limited company - including directors' responsibilities, company annual returns, reporting company changes and how to take money out of a limited company"},"updated_at":"2012-10-19T15:27:09+00:00"}]}
