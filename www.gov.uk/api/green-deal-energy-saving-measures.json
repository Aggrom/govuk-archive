You may get help with the costs if you&rsquo;re on benefits, a low income or living in an older property.</p>\n\n<p>Usually your bills won&rsquo;t go up because you shouldn&rsquo;t pay back more than the savings you&rsquo;re making as a result of the improvements. The actual savings depend on your energy use and the future cost of energy. </p>\n\n<p>You can be charged interest on your repayments and there may be penalties if you repay the money early. </p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Before you sign your Green Deal plan - check you understand the repayment rules.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Green Deal contacts</h2>\n\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<p><strong>Energy Saving Advice Service</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>0300 123 1234<br />\nMonday to Friday, 9am to 8pm<br />\nSaturday, 10am to 2pm</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<p><strong>Energy Saving Scotland</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>0800 512 012<br />\nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</p>\n</div>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures/help-from-energy-companies","slug":"help-from-energy-companies","order":3,"title":"Help from energy companies","body":"<p>Some energy companies might pay for all or part of the cost of installing things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>loft, solid wall or cavity wall insulation</li>\n  <li>boiler repairs or replacements (if you qualify) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a customer of the energy company but you must own your home or rent privately and have permission from the owner for the work.
