Your ability to see and to plan ahead will be improved if you pull back to increase your separation distance. Be patient, as larger vehicles are subject to lower speed limits than cars and motorcycles. Many large vehicles may be fitted with speed limiting devices which will restrict speed to 56 mph (90 km/h) even on a motorway.</p>\n\n<h2>223</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Buses, coaches and trams.</strong> Give priority to these vehicles when you can do so safely, especially when they signal to pull away from stops. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road.</p>\n\n<h2>224</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Electric vehicles.</strong> Be careful of electric vehicles such as milk floats and trams. Trams move quickly but silently and cannot steer to avoid you.</p>\n\n<h2>225</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicles with flashing amber beacons.</strong> These warn of a slow-moving or stationary vehicle (such as a Traffic Officer vehicle, salt spreader, snow plough or recovery vehicle) or abnormal loads, so approach with caution.
