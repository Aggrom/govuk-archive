It <strong>MUST</strong> also be fitted with a red rear reflector (and amber pedal reflectors, if manufactured after 1/10/85). White front reflectors and spoke reflectors will also help you to be seen. Flashing lights are permitted but it is recommended that cyclists who are riding in areas without street lighting use a steady front lamp.<br />\n<strong>Law RVLR regs 13, 18 &amp; 24</strong></p>\n\n<h2>61</h2>\n<p><strong>Cycle Routes and Other Facilities.</strong> Use cycle routes, advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings unless at the time it is unsafe to do so.  Use of these facilities is not compulsory and will depend on your experience and skills, but they can make your journey safer.</p>\n\n<h2>62</h2>\n<p><strong>Cycle Tracks.</strong> These are normally located away from the road, but may occasionally be found alongside footpaths or pavements. Cyclists and pedestrians may be segregated or they may share the same space (unsegregated). When using segregated tracks you <strong>MUST</strong> keep to the side intended for cyclists as the pedestrian side remains a pavement or footpath. Take care when passing pedestrians, especially children, older or disabled people, and allow them plenty of room. Always be prepared to slow down and stop if necessary. Take care near road junctions as you may have difficulty seeing other road users, who might not notice you.<br />\n<strong>Law HA 1835 sect 72</strong></p>\n\n<h2>63</h2>\n<p><strong>Cycle Lanes.</strong> These are marked by a white line (which may be broken) along the carriageway (see <a href=\"/general-rules-all-drivers-riders-103-to-158/multilane-carriageways-133-to-143\" title=\"General rules for all drivers and riders: Multilane carriageways (133 to 143)\">Rule 140</a>). Keep within the lane when practicable. When leaving a cycle lane check before pulling out that it is safe to do so and signal your intention clearly to other road users. Use of cycle lanes is not compulsory and will depend on your experience and skills, but they can make your journey safer.  </p>\n\n<h2>64</h2>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cycle on a pavement.<br />\n<strong>Laws HA 1835 sect 72 &amp; R(S)A 1984, sect 129</strong></p>\n\n<h2>65</h2>\n<p><strong>Bus Lanes.</strong> Most bus lanes may be used by cyclists as indicated on signs. Watch out for people getting on or off a bus. Be very careful when overtaking a bus or leaving a bus lane as you will be entering a busier traffic flow. Do not pass between the kerb and a bus when it is at a stop.</p>\n\n<h2>66</h2>\n<p>You should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep both hands on the handlebars except when signalling or changing gear</li>\n  <li>keep both feet on the pedals</li>\n  <li>never ride more than two abreast, and ride in single file on narrow or busy roads and when riding round bends</li>\n  <li>not ride close behind another vehicle</li>\n  <li>not carry anything which will affect your balance or may get tangled up with your wheels or chain</li>\n  <li>be considerate of other road users, particularly blind and partially sighted pedestrians. Let them know you are there when necessary, for example, by ringing your bell if you have one. It is recommended that a bell be fitted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>67</h2>\n<p>You should\n- look all around before moving away from the kerb, turning or manoeuvring, to make sure it is safe to do so. Give a clear signal to show other road users what you intend to do (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_070566.pdf\" title=\"download 'Signals to other road users' (PDF, 102KB)\">download &lsquo;Signals to other road users&rsquo; (PDF, 102KB)</a>)\n- look well ahead for obstructions in the road, such as drains, pot-holes and parked vehicles so that you do not have to swerve suddenly to avoid them. Leave plenty of room when passing parked vehicles and watch out for doors being opened or pedestrians stepping into your path \n- be aware of traffic coming up behind you\n- take extra care near road humps, narrowings and other traffic calming features\n- take care when overtaking (see <a href=\"/using-the-road-159-to-203/overtaking-162-to-169\" title=\"Using the road: Overtaking (162 to 169)\">Rules 162 to 169</a>).</p>\n\n<h2>68</h2>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>carry a passenger unless your cycle has been built or adapted to carry one</li>\n  <li>hold onto a moving vehicle or trailer</li>\n  <li>ride in a dangerous, careless or inconsiderate manner</li>\n  <li>ride when under the influence of drink or drugs, including medicine.<br />\n<strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 24, 26, 28, 29 &amp; 30 as amended by RTA 1991</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>69</h2>\n<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> obey all traffic signs and traffic light signals.<br />\n<strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD reg 10(1)</strong></p>\n\n<h2>70</h2>\n<p>When parking your cycle</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>find a conspicuous location where it can be seen by passers-by</li>\n  <li>use cycle stands or other cycle parking facilities wherever possible</li>\n  <li>do not leave it where it would cause an obstruction or hazard to other road \n users</li>\n  <li>secure it well so that it will not fall over and become an obstruction or \n hazard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>71</h2>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cross the stop line when the traffic lights are red.

Be aware that drivers may not see you. They may have to move over to the right before turning left. Wait until they have completed the manoeuvre because the rear wheels come very close to the kerb while turning. Do not be tempted to ride in the space between them and the kerb.</p>\n\n<h2>74</h2>\n<p><strong>On the right.</strong> If you are turning right, check the traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre of the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and give a final look before completing the turn. It may be safer to wait on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your cycle across the road.</p>\n\n<h2>75</h2>\n<p><strong>Dual carriageways.</strong> Remember that traffic on most dual carriageways moves quickly. When crossing wait for a safe gap and cross each carriageway in turn.
