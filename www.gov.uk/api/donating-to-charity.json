When you donate, the charity will ask you whether you want donate through Gift Aid &ndash; if you do, they’ll be able to claim back the tax you originally paid at the basic rate of 20%.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>You earn £125 and £25 tax is deducted from this at the basic rate of 20%. This leaves you with £100.
