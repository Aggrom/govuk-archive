You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive a motor vehicle without an MOT certificate when it should have one. Exceptionally, you may drive to a pre-arranged test appointment or to a garage for repairs required for the test. Driving an unroadworthy motor vehicle may invalidate your insurance. From November 2012, motor vehicles manufactured before 1960 will be exempted from an MOT requirement, although they can still be submitted for a test voluntarily. Owners are still legally required to ensure their vehicle is safe and roadworthy.<br />\n<strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 45, 47, 49 &amp; 53</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Insurance.</strong> To use a motor vehicle on the road, you <strong>MUST</strong> have a valid insurance policy. This <strong>MUST</strong> at least cover you for injury or damage to a third party while using that motor vehicle. Before driving any motor vehicle, make sure that it has this cover for your use or that your own insurance provides adequate cover. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive a motor vehicle without insurance. Also, be aware that even if a road traffic incident is not your fault, you may still be held liable by insurance companies.<br />\n<strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 143</strong></p>\n\n<p>Uninsured drivers can now be automatically detected by roadside cameras. Further to the penalties for uninsured driving listed on page 126, an offender’s vehicle can now be seized by the Police, taken away and crushed.\n<strong>Law RTA 1988, sects 165a &amp; 165b</strong></p>\n\n<p>The types of cover available are indicated below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third-Party insurance</strong>  -  this is often the cheapest form of insurance, and is the minimum cover required by law. It covers anyone you might injure or whose property you might damage. It does not cover damage to your own motor vehicle or injury to yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third-Party, Fire and Theft insurance</strong>  -  similar to third-party, but also covers you against your motor vehicle being stolen, or damaged by fire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong>  -  this is the most expensive but the best insurance. Apart from covering other persons and property against injury or damage, it also covers damage to your own motor vehicle, up to the market value of that vehicle, and personal injury to yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration certificate.</strong> Registration certificates (also called harmonised registration certificates) are issued for all motor vehicles used on the road, describing them (make, model, etc) and giving details of the registered keeper. You <strong>MUST</strong> notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea as soon as possible when you buy or sell a motor vehicle, or if you change your name or address. For registration certificates issued after 27 March 1997, the buyer and seller are responsible for completing the registration certificates. The seller is responsible for forwarding them to DVLA. The procedures are explained on the back of the registration certificates.<br />\n<strong>Law RV(R&amp;L)R regs 21, 22, 23 &amp; 24</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Vehicle Excise Duty (VED).</strong> All motor vehicles used or kept on public roads <strong>MUST</strong> display a valid Vehicle Excise Duty disc (tax disc) displayed at all times. Even motor vehicles exempt from duty MUST display a tax disc at all times.<br />\n<strong>Law VERA sects 29 and 33</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN).</strong> This is a notification to the DVLA that a motor vehicle is not being used on the road. If you are the vehicle keeper and want to keep a motor vehicle untaxed and off the public road you <strong>MUST</strong> declare SORN - it is an offence not to do so. You then won’t have to pay any road tax for that vehicle for a period of 12 months. You need to send a further declaration after that period if the vehicle is still off the public road. The SORN will end if you sell the vehicle and the new owner will become immediately responsible. If your vehicle is unused or off the road, it <strong>MUST</strong> have either a SORN declaration or valid insurance.<br />\n<strong>Law RV(RL)R 2002, reg 26 sched 4</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Production of documents.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong> be able to produce your driving licence and counterpart, a valid insurance certificate and (if appropriate) a valid MOT certificate, when requested by a police officer.
