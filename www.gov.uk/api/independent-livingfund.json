Your social worker (if you have one) will need to be there when the assessor visits.</p>\n\n<p>They will check that you&rsquo;re getting the right amount of care and look at the records you&rsquo;ve been keeping. They will also ask you about the care you pay for, the money you have and the benefits you get.</p>\n\n<h2>If your care costs change</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Independent Living Fund\">ILF</abbr> will not normally be able to meet increases in the amount of care you need. When reviewing your <abbr title=\"Independent Living Fund\">ILF</abbr> payments, the assessor will consider if the amount of money you currently receive is sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>If your care arrangements change and you need more money to pay for your care, contact your <a href=\"/apply-needs-assessment-social-services\" title=\"Apply for a needs assessment by social services\">local authority</a> and ask them to reassess your care needs. They may be able to offer you extra help.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Independent Living Fund\">ILF</abbr> will consider giving you more money if you need to pay for employer costs.
