This is a unique code allocated to the land where the pigs are kept and must be used when reporting and recording animal movements.</p>\n\n<p>You should not move pigs on or off your holding until you have been issued with a <abbr title=\"county parish holding\">CPH</abbr> number.</p>\n\n<p>You must also notify your local <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla/\" title=\"Animal Health Veterinary Laboratory Agency (AHVLA)\">Animal Health Veterinary Laboratory Agency (<abbr title=\"Animal Health Veterinary Laboratory Agency\">AHVLA</abbr>)</a>&rdquo; Divisional Office where you are going to keep pigs and they will give you a herdmark for your holding.</p>\n\n<h2>Conditions</h2>\n\n<p>All pigs must be identified by an eartag or tattoo (either on the ear or a slapmark on the shoulder) containing your herdmark before they can leave the holding. Pigs less than 12 months old moving between farms can be identified by a temporary paint mark instead.</p>\n\n<p>If you are moving pigs to a show or exhibition, to a semen collection centre, for breeding purposes, intra-Community trade or export or under a walking licence, they must also be identified with a unique individual identification number - eg by adding that number to the eartag.</p>\n\n<p>Before you move a pig on or off your holding you must notify the movement to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.scoteid.com/\" title=\"Scottish livestock traceability team (ScotEID)\">Scottish livestock traceability team (<abbr title=\"Scottish livestock traceability team\">ScotEID</abbr>)</a> by registering electronically on the <abbr title=\"Scottish livestock traceability team\">ScotEID</abbr> website or by calling or writing to the information centre.</p>\n\n<p>Your notification must specify the:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>address (including postcode and <abbr title=\"county parish holding\">CPH</abbr> number) of the holdings from and to which the pigs are being moved</li>\n  <li>date of the movement</li>\n  <li>number of pigs moved</li>\n  <li>identification mark of each pig moved</li>\n  <li>lot number of pigs being moved, if they&rsquo;re being moved from a market</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This information should also be recorded in your own holding register within 48 hours of a movement on or off your holding. You should keep a separate register for each holding you use. Holding registers can take any form that you like but you must keep records for a minimum of three years and make them available for inspection on request. Once a year you must also record all the pigs in your holding.</p>\n\n<p>Pig movements must be accompanied by a movement document. This can be printed off if you have registered on the <abbr title=\"Scottish livestock traceability team\">ScotEID</abbr> website or sent to you if you notified the movement by telephone. However, if you have chosen to notify <abbr title=\"Scottish livestock traceability team\">ScotEID</abbr> in writing, you must supply your own movement document.</p>\n\n<p>When pigs arrive on your holding, this triggers a &lsquo;standstill&rsquo; during which other livestock must not be moved off the holding for a set period of time.

If you fail to comply with any of these rules, <abbr title=\"Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate\">RPID</abbr> inspectors may take enforcement action. This ranges from the issuing of guidance on how to take steps, to prosecuting you for committing a criminal offence. Movement restrictions may also be placed on your holding until problems are rectified.</p>\n\n"},"tags":[],"related":[]}
