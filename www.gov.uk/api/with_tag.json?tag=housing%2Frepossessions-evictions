If the landlord wants to evict you, they’ll have to restart the court process from the beginning.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of possession order</h2>\n\n<p>There are several different kinds of orders a judge can make.</p>\n\n<h3>Order for possession (or ‘outright possession order’)</h3>\n<p>This means you must leave the property before the date given in the order. </p>\n\n<p>The date will be either 14 or 28 days after your court hearing. If you’re in an exceptionally difficult situation, you may be able to convince the judge to delay this for up to 6 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t leave your home by the date given, your landlord can ask the court to evict you by asking for a ‘warrant for possession’. If the court gives a warrant, you’ll be sent an eviction notice that gives a date when you must leave your home. </p>\n\n<h3>Suspended order for possession</h3>\n<p>This means if you make the payments, or obey the conditions, set out in the order, you can stay in your home. If you don’t make the payments, your landlord can ask the court to evict you. </p>\n\n<h3>Money order</h3>\n<p>This means you have to pay the landlord the amount set out in the order. If you don’t make the payments, action could be taken by the courts to recover the money, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deducting money from your wages or bank account</li>\n  <li>sending bailiffs to take away things you own</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you get into rent arrears after a money order has been made, your landlord can go to court again and ask for a possession order.</p>\n\n<h3>Possession orders with a money judgment</h3>\n<p>A judge can add a money judgment to any of the possession orders. This means you owe a specific amount of money, usually made up of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your rent arrears</li>\n  <li>court fees</li>\n  <li>your landlord’s legal costs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The money judgment won’t apply if you pay your arrears and the amount set out in a suspended possession order.</p>\n\n<p>However, the money judgment will apply if you don’t pay the amount set out in the suspended possession order that’s linked to the judgment. If you don’t pay, the landlord may ask the court to carry out the instructions in the order and the judgment.</p>\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/private-renting-evictions/eviction-notices","slug":"eviction-notices","order":4,"title":"Eviction notices","body":"<p>If you don’t leave your home by the date given in an outright possession order, your landlord can ask the court for a ‘warrant for possession’. </p>\n\n<p>If the court gives a warrant, you’ll be sent an eviction notice that gives a date when you must leave your home. </p>\n\n<p>If you don’t go, bailiffs can evict you.
