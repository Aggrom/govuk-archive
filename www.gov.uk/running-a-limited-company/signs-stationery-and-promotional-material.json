Divide \u00a3900 by 9, which gives you a dividend tax credit of \u00a3100. Pay \u00a3900 to the shareholder - but add the \u00a3100 tax credit and record a total of \u00a31,000 in your company accounts.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n###Dividend paperwork\r\n\r\nFor each dividend payment the company makes, you must write up a dividend voucher showing the:\r\n\r\n- date\r\n- company name\r\n- names of the shareholders being paid a dividend\r\n- amount of the dividend\r\n- the amount of the dividend tax credit\r\n\r\nYou must keep 2 copies of the voucher - 1 for your personal tax return and 1 for your company records.\r\n\r\n##Directors\u2019 loans\r\n\r\nIf you take more money out of a company than you've put in - and it isn't salary or a dividend - it\u2019s called a \u2018directors\u2019 loan.\u2019\r\n \r\nIf your company makes directors\u2019 loans, you must keep records of them.
