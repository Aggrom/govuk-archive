  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="directors-responsibilities"><header><h1>Part 1: Directors' responsibilities</h1>
  </header><p>As a director of a limited company, the law says you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>try to make the company a success, using your skills, experience and judgment</li>
  <li>follow the company’s rules, shown in its <a href="/limited-company-formation/articles-of-association" title="Articles of association for a limited company">articles of association</a>
</li>
  <li>make decisions for the benefit of the company, not yourself</li>
  <li>tell other shareholders if you might personally benefit from a transaction the company makes</li>
  <li>keep company records and report changes to Companies House and HM Revenue &amp; Customs</li>
  <li>make sure the company’s accounts are a ‘true and fair view’ of the business’ finances</li>
  <li>
<a href="/register-for-self-assessment" title="Register for Self Assessment">register for Self Assessment</a> and send a personal <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return</a> every year</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask other people to manage some of these things day-to-day. For example, an accountant can manage your accounts for you - but you’re still legally responsible for them.</p>

</article><article id="taking-money-out-of-a-limited-company"><header><h1>Part 2: Taking money out of a limited company</h1>
  </header><p>As a director of a limited company, you can take money from the company in 3 ways.</p>

<h2>Salary, expenses and benefits</h2>

<p>If you want the company to pay you a salary, expenses or benefits, you must <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/intro/register.htm" title="How to register as an employer">register the company</a> as an employer with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). </p>

<p>The company must take Income Tax and National Insurance contributions from your salary payments and pay these to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, along with employers’ National Insurance contributions. </p>

<h2>Dividends</h2>

<p>A dividend is a payment a company can make to shareholders if it has made enough profit. </p>

<p>You can’t count dividends as business costs when you work out your Corporation Tax. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You mustn’t make a dividend payment if it means the company won’t be able to pay its bills.</p>
</div>

<p>You must usually pay dividends to all shareholders.  </p>

<p>To pay a dividend, you must: </p>

<ul>
<li>hold a directors’ meeting to ‘declare’ the dividend </li>
  <li>keep minutes of the meeting, even if you’re the only director</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dividend paperwork</h3>

<p>For each dividend payment the company makes, you must write up a dividend voucher showing the:</p>

<ul>
<li>date</li>
  <li>company name</li>
  <li>names of the shareholders being paid a dividend</li>
  <li>amount of the dividend</li>
  <li>the amount of the ‘dividend tax credit’</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dividend tax credits</h3>

<p>The tax credit means your company and shareholders don’t need to pay tax when the dividend is paid. But shareholders may have to <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/taxon/uk.htm" title="Tax on UK dividends">pay tax on it.</a></p>

<h3>Working out the dividend tax credit</h3>

<p>To work out the dividend tax credit, divide the dividend amount by 9.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>You want to pay a dividend of £900. Divide £900 by 9, which gives you a dividend tax credit of £100. Pay £900 to the shareholder - but add the £100 tax credit and record a total of £1,000 on the dividend voucher.</p>
</div>

<p>You must keep 2 copies of the voucher - 1 for your personal tax return and 1 for your company records.</p>

<h2>Directors’ loans</h2>

<p>If you take more money out of a company than you’ve put in - and it isn’t salary or a dividend - it’s called a ‘directors’ loan.’</p>

<p>If your company makes directors’ loans, you must keep records of them. There are also some detailed tax rules about <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ct/managing/director-loan.htm" title="Directors' loans and Corporation Tax explained">how directors’ loans are handled.</a></p>


</article><article id="company-changes-you-must-report"><header><h1>Part 3: Company changes you must report</h1>
  </header><h2>Changing your company’s registered office address</h2>

<p>You must tell Companies House if you want to change your company’s registered office address. If the change is approved, they will tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Your company’s new registered office address must be in the same part of the UK that the company was registered (incorporated).</p>

<p>For example, if your company was registered in England and Wales, the new registered office address must be in England or Wales.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your registered office address won’t officially change until Companies House has confirmed it with you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other changes you must report</h2>

<p>You must tell Companies House within 14 days if you make changes to:</p>

<ul>
<li>where company records are kept</li>
  <li>directors or their personal details, like their address</li>
  <li>company secretaries (appointing a new one or ending an existing one’s appointment)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must tell Companies House within a month if you issue more shares in your company.</p>

<h2>How to report changes to Companies House</h2>

<p>You can: </p>

<ul>
<li>use the <a href="/file-changes-to-a-company-with-companies-house" title="File changes to my company with Companies House">Companies House online service</a>  </li>
  <li>fill in and send <a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/forms/formsOnline.shtml#Company" title="Full listing of Companies House forms to notify changes to a limited company">paper forms</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes that shareholders must approve</h2>

<p>You may need to get shareholders to vote on the decision if you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>change the company name</li>
  <li>remove a director</li>
  <li>change the company’s articles of association</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called ‘passing a resolution’. Most resolutions will need a majority to agree (called an ‘ordinary resolution’). Some might require a 75% majority (called a ‘special resolution’). </p>

<p>Companies House has more details about the types of <a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/gbhtml/gp3.shtml" title="Company changes you must tell Companies House about">changes and resolutions you must report</a> to them.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your new company name won’t take effect until it’s registered by Companies House - they’ll tell you when this happens.</p>
</div>

<h3>Shareholder voting</h3>

<p>When you’re working out whether you have a majority, count the number of shares that give the owner the right to vote, rather than the number of shareholders.</p>

<p>You don’t necessarily need to have a meeting of shareholders to pass a resolution. If the right amount of shareholders have told you they agree, you can confirm the resolution in writing. But you must write to all shareholders letting them know about the decision.</p>

<h2>Reporting changes to HM Revenue &amp; Customs</h2>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/report-changes/business.htm" title="Reporting changes to HMRC - businesses">tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr></a> if your business’ contact details change.</p>

<p>If you want to get an accountant or adviser to manage your company’s Corporation Tax, you must tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You do this on form 64-8, or using <a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/login" title="HMRC Online services">Corporation Tax Online.</a></p>
