  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit when you sell or give away something (an ‘asset’) that has increased in value. </p>

<p>It’s the gain you make, not the amount of money you receive, that’s taxed.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You bought some shares for £2,500 and sold them later for £12,500. This means you made a gain of £10,000 (£12,500 less £2,500). </p>

<p>If you gave the shares away instead of selling them, the gain would still be £10,000.</p>
</div>

<h2>Current rate of Capital Gains Tax</h2>
<p>For gains made on or before 22 June 2010, Capital Gains Tax is charged at a rate of 18%.</p>

<p>From 23 June 2010 onwards, the rates are:</p>

<ul>
<li>18% and 28% for individuals (the rate depends on your <a href="/capital-gains-tax/work-out-your-capital-gains-tax-rate" title="Capital Gains Tax (Work out your Capital Gains Tax)">total taxable income</a>
</li>
  <li>28% for trustees or personal representatives of someone who has died</li>
  <li>10% for gains qualifying for <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/businesses/reliefs.htm" title="Entrepreneurs' Relief">Entrepreneurs’ Relief</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2>When you don’t pay Capital Gains Tax</h2>
<p>Capital Gains Tax doesn’t apply to personal belongings worth £6,000 or less.</p>

<p>You won’t usually have to pay it if you sell your main home, because of <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/property/sell-own-home.htm#1" title="What is Private Residence Relief?">Private Residence Relief.</a></p>

<p>There’s also an annual tax-free allowance (the Annual Exempt Amount), which for 2012 to 2013 is:</p>

<ul>
<li>£10,600 for individuals</li>
  <li>£5,300 for most trustees</li>
</ul>
<p>If your overall gains are below this, you don’t have to pay Capital Gains Tax.</p>

</article><article id="when-you-pay-capital-gains-tax"><header><h1>Part 2: When you pay Capital Gains Tax</h1>
  </header><p>You pay Capital Gains Tax on any profit you make when you ‘dispose’ of an asset, which means:</p>

<ul>
<li>selling it</li>
  <li>giving it away as a gift</li>
  <li>transferring it to someone else</li>
  <li>exchanging it for something else</li>
  <li>getting compensation for it - like an insurance payout if it’s been destroyed</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t pay Capital Gains Tax on any gains you make from:</p>

<ul>
<li>your car</li>
  <li>your main home - as long as you don’t use it for anything else, like running a business, and the grounds aren’t bigger than 5,000 square metres</li>
  <li>Individual Savings Accounts (<abbr title="Individual Savings Accounts">ISAs</abbr>) or Personal Equity Plans (<abbr title="Personal Equity Plans">PEPs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>UK government gilts (bonds)</li>
  <li>personal belongings worth £6,000 or less when you sell them</li>
  <li>betting, lottery or pools winnings</li>
  <li>money which forms part of your income for Income Tax purposes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transferring or selling assets</h2>
<p>If you’re married or in a civil partnership and living together you can transfer assets to your partner without paying Capital Gains Tax.</p>

<p>You can’t give assets to others or sell assets cheaply without considering Capital Gains Tax.</p>

<h2>If you make a loss on an asset</h2>
<p>If you make a loss on an asset that normally attracts Capital Gains Tax, you can claim for your loss and deduct it from other gains. </p>

<h2>When someone dies</h2>
<p>If someone dies and leaves their belongings to you:</p>

<ul>
<li>there’s no Capital Gains Tax to pay at that time</li>
  <li>if you later dispose of an asset, any Capital Gains Tax will be based on the difference between the market value at the time of death and the value at the time of disposal</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss"><header><h1>Part 3: Work out your capital gain or loss</h1>
  </header><p>You work out Capital Gains Tax for each tax year. It’s charged on the total of your taxable gains, after taking into account:</p>

<ul>
<li>certain costs and reliefs that can reduce or defer gains</li>
  <li>allowable losses you have made on assets to which Capital Gains Tax normally applies</li>
  <li>the Annual Exempt Amount - if your gains are below £10,600 you don’t have to pay</li>
</ul>
<p>You work out the gain or loss for each asset separately and then see if Capital Gains Tax is due.</p>

<p>There’s more information on <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/intro/working-basics.htm" title="working out your capital gain or loss" rel="external">working out your capital gain or loss</a> on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) website.</p>

</article><article id="work-out-your-capital-gains-tax-rate"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out your Capital Gains Tax rate</h1>
  </header><ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Work out how much of your income is taxable - by deducting any <a href="/income-tax-rates" title="Income Tax rates and allowances">tax-free allowances and reliefs</a> you’re entitled to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See how much of your Income Tax <a href="/income-tax-rates" title="Income Tax rates and allowances">basic rate band</a> is already being used against your taxable income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use any remaining basic rate band against gains that qualify for <a href="/entrepreneurs-relief" title="Entrepreneurs' Relief">Entrepreneurs’ Relief</a> - these are charged at 10%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is any basic rate band left after step 3, use it against your other gains - charged at 18%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any remaining gains above the basic rate band are charged at 28%.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> </p>

<p>Your total taxable income is £20,000 and your total gains are £12,000. </p>

<p>Deduct the <a href="/capital-gains-tax/overview" title="Capital Gains Tax (Overview)">tax-free allowance</a> of £10,600 from your gains, leaving £1,400 to pay tax on. You’ve used £20,000 of the basic rate band against your taxable income, so you have £14,370 left. </p>

<p>You have enough of the basic rate band remaining to cover your gains, so you pay Capital Gains Tax at 18% on £1,400. </p>

<p>This means you’ll pay £252 in Capital Gains Tax.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="report-and-pay-capital-gains-tax"><header><h1>Part 5: Report and pay Capital Gains Tax</h1>
