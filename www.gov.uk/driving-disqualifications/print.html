  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can be disqualified from driving if you either:</p>

<ul>
<li>are convicted of a driving offence </li>
  <li>get 12 or more penalty points (endorsements) within 3 years</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get a summons in the post that tells you when you must go to court.</p>

<h2>How long disqualifications last</h2>

<p>If you’re disqualified for a driving offence, the court will decide how long the disqualification will last, based on how serious they think the offence is.</p>

<p>If you’ve got more than 12 penalty points, you could be disqualified for:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>6 months if you get 12 penalty points or more within 3 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>12 months if you get a 2nd disqualification within 3 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 years if you get a 3rd disqualification</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Disqualified for more than 56 days</h2>

<p>If you’re disqualified for 56 days or more you must <a href="/reapply-licence-revoked" title="Reapplying for your driving licence if it's been revoked">apply for a new licence</a> before driving again.</p>

<p>You might also have to retake your <a href="/driving-disqualifications/disqualification-until-test-pass-or-extended-test-pass" title="Driving disqualifications until test pass or extended test pass">driving test or take an extended driving test</a> before getting your new licence. The court will tell you if you have to do this at your hearing.</p>

<h2>Disqualified for less than 56 days</h2>

<p>Your paper driving licence or counterpart document will be stamped by the court and given back to you. This is called ‘short period disqualification’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You won’t need to renew your licence. The stamp shows the disqualification period and you can use the same licence again once this is over.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="check-when-your-disqualification-ends"><header><h1>Part 2: Check when your disqualification ends</h1>
  </header><p>To check when your disqualification ends you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="https://motoring.direct.gov.uk/service/DvoConsumer.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=GDR&amp;_nfls=false" title="View your driving licence details online">view your driving licence details online</a> if you previously applied for your licence over the internet</li>
  <li>check the date on the reminder form D27 that <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> sends you 56 days before your disqualification ends</li>
  <li>check the date stamped on your paper licence or counterpart document if you’re disqualified for less than 56 days</li>
  <li>phone <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> customer enquiries</li>
</ul>

</div>


</article><article id="apply-to-reduce-your-disqualification-period"><header><h1>Part 3: Apply to reduce your disqualification period</h1>
  </header><p>You can ask the court to reduce your disqualification period if you’ve been disqualified for:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 years - if the disqualification was for more than 2 but fewer than 4 years</li>
  <li>half the disqualification period - if it was for between 4 and 10 years</li>
  <li>5 years - if the disqualification was for 10 years or more</li>
</ul>
<p>You must have a good reason for asking for the disqualification to be reduced. </p>

<p>For example, you think the court made a legal mistake or there were reasons you committed the driving offence that the court didn’t take into account.</p>

<p>Write to the court that disqualified you with the date of offence, date of conviction and any other supporting information. If the court decides to reduce your disqualification period, it will tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If the court refuses your request you have to wait 3 months before you can ask again.</p>
</div>

<h2>If your disqualification is shortened</h2>

<p>Apply for a new licence by sending <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> a form D1. You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>get it from most Post Offices</li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.dvla.gov.uk/dvla/onlineservices/order_forms.aspx?ext=dg" title="DVLA forms ordering">order it from <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>.</a></li>
</ul></article><article id="disqualification-outside-great-britain"><header><h1>Part 4: Disqualification outside Great Britain</h1>
  </header><p>If you’ve been disqualified on your Great Britain driving licence you’re also disqualified from driving in Northern Ireland, Ireland and the Isle of Man.  </p>

<p>This is called ‘mutual recognition of disqualification’. Disqualified drivers from those areas are also disqualified from driving in Great Britain.</p>


</article><article id="changes-to-your-name-and-address-while-disqualified"><header><h1>Part 5: Changes to your name and address while disqualified</h1>
  </header><p>Tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> if you change your name or address while disqualified.</p>

<p>Write with details of your old and new address, name if changed, your driving licence number (if known) and date of birth.</p>

  </header><p>If you’re disqualified until ‘test pass’ or ‘extended test pass’ and want to drive again, you must apply for a new provisional driving licence before you take the tests you need.</p>

<h2>How to get a new licence</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will send you a reminder 56 days before your disqualification ends - use this to apply for a new provisional driving licence.</p>
