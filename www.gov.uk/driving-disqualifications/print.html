</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can be disqualified from driving if you’re convicted of a driving offence. You might have to take your driving test again, answer health questions or have medical tests before you get your licence back.</p>

<p>You can also be disqualified if you get 12 or more penalty points (endorsements) within 3 years. You can be disqualified for:  </p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>6 months if you get 12 penalty points or more within 3 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>12 months if you get a 2nd disqualification within 3 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 years if you get a 3rd disqualification</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Short period disqualification</h2>

<p>If you’re disqualified for less than 56 days, your paper driving licence or counterpart document will be stamped by the court and given back to you. This is called ‘short period disqualification’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You won’t need to renew your licence. The stamp shows the disqualification period and you can use the same licence again once this is over.</p>
</div>

<h2>Disqualification for 56 days or more</h2>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re disqualified for 56 days or more you have to renew your licence before driving again.</p>
</div>

<p>You might also have to retake your driving test or take an extended driving test before getting your licence back.</p>

<p>If you’ve been disqualified for some alcohol-related offences, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will make medical enquiries before you can get your licence back.</p>


</article><article id="disqualification-until-test-pass-or-extended-test-pass"><header><h1>Part 2: Disqualification until 'test pass' or 'extended test pass'</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re disqualified until ‘test pass’ or ‘extended test pass’, you’ll need to apply for a provisional driving licence and take your theory and practical tests again before you can get your full licence back.</p>

<p>Motorcycle riders will have to complete compulsory basic training (<abbr title="Compulsory Basic Training">CBT</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Disqualified until extended test pass</h2>

<p>You’ll have to sit an extended practical driving test if you’ve been disqualified until extended test pass.</p>

<p>You’ll need to pass a test in category A (motorcycle) or B (car) if you want to drive all categories of vehicles you were previously entitled to.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The local traffic commissioner will need to agree before you can get category C (large vehicle) and or D (bus) entitlements back.</p>

    <p>2 years of the disqualification period if the disqualification was for more than 2 years but less than 4 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>half the disqualification period if the disqualification was for more than 4 years but less than 10 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5 years of the disqualification period if the disqualification was for 10 years or more</p>
  </li>
