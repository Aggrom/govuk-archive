  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="travel-by-train"><header><h1>Part 1: Trains</h1>
  </header><p>You can give <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/passenger_services/disabled_passengers/" title="Information for disabled passengers on the National Rail website">National Rail</a> train companies advance notice if you think you’ll need any help from staff.</p>

<p>You can plan your route around a station with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/" title="Stations Made Easy tool">Stations Made Easy tool.</a> </p>

<h2>Wheelchairs on trains</h2>
<p>On mainline (intercity, suburban and cross-country) trains there’s space for your wheelchair. Put your chair in this space and use the brakes (or switch your wheelchair’s power off) when the train is moving.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>Your right to travel by train is protected by the train company’s Disabled People’s Protection Policy (<abbr title="Disabled People's Protection Policy">DPPP</abbr>). Each train company must produce a <abbr title="Disabled People's Protection Policy">DPPP</abbr> and you can get a copy from the company. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Disabled People's Protection Policy">DPPP</abbr> explains how the train company helps disabled passengers use their stations and trains.</p>
</div>

<h2>Disabled person’s railcard</h2>
<p>You can get up to a third off rail tickets by applying for a <a rel="external" href="http://www.disabledpersons-railcard.co.uk" title="disabled person's railcard">disabled person’s railcard.</a></p>


</article><article id="planes"><header><h1>Part 2: Planes</h1>
  </header><p>You need to tell your airline, travel agent or tour operator what help you’ll need at the airport or on the plane, eg if you have a wheelchair. </p>

<p>Airlines and airports have different facilities for disabled people. You’ll need to find out if they have the facilities you need, eg a toilet with disabled access.</p>

<h2>Taking your wheelchair on the plane</h2>
<p>You can’t take your own wheelchair into the passenger cabin of a plane. It will be stored in the hold of the plane. Speak to your airline to find out what help they’ll provide when boarding the plane.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>Under European law, disabled people and other people with reduced mobility have legal rights to assistance when travelling by air. There is detailed information about this on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/service-users-guidance/air-travel" title="Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) website">Equality and Human Rights Commission (<abbr title="Equality and Human Rights Commission">EHRC</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<p>Disabled people can <a href="/apply-blue-badge" title="Apply for a Blue Badge" rel="external">apply for a Blue Badge</a> so you can park close to where you want to go. </p>

<h2>Bus and coach</h2>
<p>Disabled people can get a <a href="/apply-for-disabled-bus-pass" title="Free bus passes">bus pass for free travel.</a></p>

<p>The law says bus and coach drivers must give reasonable assistance to disabled people, eg helping them get on and off the bus or coach. This doesn’t mean physically lifting passengers or heavy mobility equipment. </p>

<p>If you need help to get on and off a coach, you should ask for this when you book your ticket.</p>

  </header><p><a rel="external" href="http://www.shopmobilityuk.org" title="Shopmobility">Shopmobility</a> lends wheelchairs and powered scooters to people who are disabled so they can shop or visit leisure facilities in a town, city or shopping centre.</p>
