  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="trains"><header><h1>Part 1: Trains</h1>
  </header><p>You can give <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/passenger_services/disabled_passengers/" title="Information for disabled passengers on the National Rail website">National Rail</a> train companies advance notice if you think you’ll need any help from staff.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/" title="check if a station has accessible facilities on National Rail website">check if a station has accessible facilities.</a> </p>

<h2>Wheelchairs on trains</h2>
<p>On mainline (intercity, suburban and cross-country) trains there’s space for your wheelchair. Put your chair in this space and use the brakes (or switch your wheelchair’s power off) when the train is moving.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>Your right to travel by train is protected by the train company’s Disabled People’s Protection Policy (<abbr title="Disabled People's Protection Policy">DPPP</abbr>). Each train company must produce a <abbr title="Disabled People's Protection Policy">DPPP</abbr> and you can get a copy from the company. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Disabled People's Protection Policy">DPPP</abbr> explains how the train company helps disabled passengers use their stations and trains.</p>
</div>

<h2>Disabled person’s railcard</h2>
<p>If you’re eligible you can get up to a third off rail tickets by applying for a <a rel="external" href="http://www.disabledpersons-railcard.co.uk" title="disabled person's railcard">disabled person’s railcard.</a> You must provide evidence of a relevant disability.</p>


</article><article id="planes"><header><h1>Part 2: Planes</h1>
  </header><p>You need to tell your airline, travel agent or tour operator what help you’ll need at the airport or on the plane, eg if you have a wheelchair. </p>

<p>Airlines and airports have different facilities for disabled people. You’ll need to find out from your airport or airline if they have the facilities you need, eg a toilet with disabled access.</p>

<h2>Taking your wheelchair on the plane</h2>
<p>You can’t take your own wheelchair into the passenger cabin of a plane. It will be stored in the hold of the plane. Speak to your airline to find out what help they’ll provide when boarding the plane.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>Under European law, disabled people and other people with reduced mobility have legal rights to help when travelling by air. There is detailed information about this on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/service-users-guidance/air-travel" title="Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) website">Equality and Human Rights Commission (<abbr title="Equality and Human Rights Commission">EHRC</abbr>) website.</a></p>


</article><article id="cars-buses-and-coaches"><header><h1>Part 3: Cars, buses and coaches</h1>
  </header><p>If you have a car, find out what you need to do if you’re <a href="/driving-if-disabled" title="Medical conditions, disabilities and driving">driving and disabled</a>, eg learning to drive and getting insured.</p>

<p>Disabled people can <a href="/apply-blue-badge" title="Apply for a Blue Badge">apply for a Blue Badge</a> so you can park close to where you want to go.</p>

<h2>Bus and coach</h2>
<p>Disabled people can get a <a href="/apply-for-disabled-bus-pass" title="Free bus passes">bus pass for free travel.</a></p>

<p>The law says bus and coach drivers must give reasonable assistance to disabled people, eg helping them get on and off the bus or coach. This doesn’t mean physically lifting passengers or heavy mobility equipment. </p>

<p>If you need help to get on and off a coach, you should ask for this when you book your ticket.</p>


</article><article id="taxis-and-minicabs"><header><h1>Part 4: Taxis and minicabs</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Licensed taxis can be hailed on the street, picked up at ranks or pre-booked, but you can only pre-book minicabs (also called ‘private hire vehicles’).</p>
</div>

<h2>Wheelchair access</h2>

<p>In some areas (mainly larger cities), licensed taxis have to be wheelchair accessible.</p>

<p>To find out if there are accessible taxis near you, contact the taxi licensing office at your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="local council" rel="external">local council.</a></p>

<h3>London taxis</h3>

<p>In London, all black cabs are wheelchair accessible.</p>

<p>Some of the newer ‘black cabs’ are also fitted with induction loops and intercoms for hearing aid users.</p>

<h2>Assistance dogs</h2>

<p>If you travel with an assistance dog they must be allowed into the taxi or minicab with you, unless the driver has an exemption certificate. This can be issued if they’ve got a medical condition made worse by contact with dogs.</p>

<p>A driver with an exemption certificate will have a yellow ‘Notice of Exemption’ notice on their vehicle windscreen.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It’s illegal to be charged extra to travel in a taxi or minicab with an assistance dog. Otherwise the driver could be fined up to £1,000.</p>
</div>

<p>The following types of dog can be taken with you in taxis or minicabs:</p>

<ul>
<li>guide dogs trained by the Guide Dogs organisation</li>
  <li>hearing dogs trained by Hearing Dogs</li>
  <li>assistance dogs trained by Dogs for the Disabled, Support Dogs or Canine Partners</li>
</ul>
<h3>Travelling with your dog</h3>

<p>Taxi and private hire vehicle drivers have been told how to identify assistance dogs. </p>

<p>Your assistance dog should wear its harness or identification jacket when you are travelling with it. If an identification card was issued for the dog, this should also be carried.</p>

<p>Dogs should remain on the floor and under control at all times. If your dog causes any damage to the vehicle, the driver could ask you to pay for it.</p>

<h2>Reporting problems</h2>

<p>As well as the rules on wheelchairs and assistance dogs, all taxi and minicab drivers must make sure they don’t discriminate against you and can’t treat you less favourably than other customers. They should also make any ‘reasonable adjustments’ to their service for you to make your journey easier.</p>

<p>You should report any problems to the <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="local council" rel="external">taxi  licensing office at your local council.</a></p>
