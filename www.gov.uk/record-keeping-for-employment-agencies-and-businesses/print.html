  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re running an employment agency or employment businesses you must keep proper records on the <a href="/record-keeping-for-employment-agencies-and-businesses/records-about-workseekers" title="work-seekers">work-seekers</a> and <a href="/record-keeping-for-employment-agencies-and-businesses/records-about-hirers" title="hirers">hirers</a> you do business with.</p>

<p>You must <a href="/record-keeping-for-employment-agencies-and-businesses/storing-and-accessing-records" title="keep the records">keep the records</a> for set amounts of time and make them easily available to Employment Agency Standards (EAS) inspectors.</p>

  <li>the date any applications are withdrawn or contracts are terminated</li>
  <li>details of enquires about the work-seeker and the position concerned (including copies of all relevant documents and dates they were received or sent)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>the dates of requests for fees from the work-seeker and receipts of fees or payments, with copy statements or invoices, numbers and amounts</li>
  <li>statements of dates and amounts of sums deducted from money you received on the work-seeker’s behalf, which was paid into a ‘client account’ to hold the work-seekers money</li>
</ul></article><article id="records-about-hirers"><header><h1>Part 3: Records about hirers </h1>

</ul></article><article id="records-when-more-than-one-agency-or-business-is-involved"><header><h1>Part 4: Records when more than one agency or business is involved</h1>
  </header><p>If more than 1 employment agency or business is involved with the hirer or work-seeker you also need to keep the following records:</p>

<ul>
<li>names of any other agencies or employment businesses that the agency or employment business uses</li>
  <li>details of enquiries about that agency or employment business’s suitability, including copies of all relevant documents and dates the enquiries were made and answers received</li>
  <li>date and copy of any agreement with the other agency</li>
</ul></article><article id="storing-and-accessing-records"><header><h1>Part 5: Storing and accessing records</h1>
  </header><h2>Client account records</h2>

<p>Records for <a href="/entertainment-and-modelling-agencies" title="entertainment and modelling agencies">entertainment and modelling agencies</a> have to be kept for at least 6 years. </p>

<h2>Records of applications</h2>

<p>Records of applications from hirers and work-seekers have to be kept for at least 1 year from when the agency or business last provided its services for them.</p>

<h2>Where to keep records</h2>

<p>It doesn’t matter where you keep the records as long as they can be accessed easily.</p>

<h2>Requests for records</h2>

<p>If an Employment Agency Standards (<abbr title="Employment Agency Standards">EAS</abbr>) inspector asks to see your records they must be provided by the end of the 2nd business day after the request was made.</p>

<p>For example, if records are requested on Monday, they must be provided by the end of Wednesday.</p>

<p>Records can be kept in electronic form as long as they can be reproduced and read easily.</p>


</article><article id="inspections-and-enforcement-of-the-rules"><header><h1>Part 6: Inspections and enforcement of the rules</h1>
  </header><p>The Employment Agency Standards (<abbr title="Employment Agency Standards">EAS</abbr>) Inspectorate checks that employment agencies and businesses are following the rules.</p>

<p>Its main way of checking is by sending out inspectors.</p>

<h2>What <abbr title="Employment Agency Standards">EAS</abbr> inspectors can do</h2>

<p><abbr title="Employment Agency Standards">EAS</abbr> inspectors investigate complaints, follow up allegations of misconduct, and make targeted checks of employment agencies and businesses.</p>

<p>Inspectors have to carry official ID. They can enter domestic or commercial premises they’ve got reason to believe are, or have been, used as an employment agency or business.</p>

<p>Inspectors can inspect records and documents to make sure the agency or business is following the rules.</p>

<p>They can:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask to see documents and financial records</li>
  <li>copy these records</li>
  <li>remove the records to copy them</li>
  <li>request in writing that any record, document or information is provided to them at a time and place of their choice so they don’t have to go back to the premises</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enforcement of the rules</h2>

<p>If your employment agency or business is breaking the rules you’ll be sent a warning letter saying how and what you have to do to fix this.</p>

<p>There might be a follow-up inspection.</p>

<p>In serious cases you might be prosecuted or referred to an employment tribunal and you could get stopped from working as an employment agency or business.</p>

<p>Most breaches of the rules are criminal offences. You could be tried in a Magistrates’ Court with a maximum fine of £5,000 or even taken to the Crown Court where the fine is unlimited.</p>
