</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><h2>Reporting a work accident</h2>

<p>If you have an accident at work, you should tell your employer straight away, even if the accident doesn’t seem serious at the time.
You can apply for a declaration that you have had an industrial accident, even if you don’t want to claim any benefit right away.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to apply for a declaration if you’re not disabled immediately after your accident, but you think you may experience problems in the future as a result.</p>

<h2>What to do if your circumstances change</h2>

<p>It is important you contact the office that deals with your payments if you or someone you claim for:</p>

<ul>
<li>goes into or leaves hospital </li>
  <li>goes into or leaves a care home </li>
  <li>goes abroad to live or visit </li>
  <li>goes into prison </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the above list is not exhaustive.</p>
