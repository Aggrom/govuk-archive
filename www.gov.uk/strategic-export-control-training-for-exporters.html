<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are confused or feel daunted by export controls, then help is at hand.</p>

<p>The Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>), is the UK’s regulatory strategic export licensing authority responsible for issuing licences for military and dual-use items.</p>

<p>If your exports are of a defence, security, high tech or ‘strategic’ nature (or your products or services can be adapted for such uses) then you should take active steps to comply with and to understand the UK’s export control legislation.</p>

<p>Developing your skills and knowledge in export control matters could make all the difference to succeeding in your export activities efficiently and quickly. Complying with export controls is not just about your administrative procedures. It is also vital to fully understand the issues at stake and to give the process your due care and attention.</p>

<p>For this reason, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> is committed to providing a comprehensive programme of seminars and workshops to help exporters better understand the controls and their responsibilities. They can provide both scheduled and bespoke training, charged at a modest fee.</p>

<p>This guide provides a brief overview of the scheduled courses offered by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, in-house company training options, details of online films and e-learning courses. </p>

<h2 id="overview-of-eco-training-provision">Overview of <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> training provision</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> runs a range of courses designed to extend the knowledge and awareness of all exporters about their legal responsibilities in the field of export controls on military and dual-use goods.</p>

<p>These courses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>beginners seminar</li>
  <li>intermediate seminar</li>
  <li>making better licence applications workshop</li>
  <li>control list classification and use of the checker tools workshop</li>
  <li>open licence and compliance workshop</li>
  <li>trade control seminar</li>
  <li>exporting cryptographic products seminar</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, subject to demand, they also run a seminar on the role of other government departments involved in the licensing process. They have also previously run seminars on sanctions imposed on Iran.</p>

<p>A comprehensive programme of seminars and workshops, online training and guidance to help exporters understand and comply with the law is on offer. </p>

<p>A brief overview of each of the regular courses is provided below:</p>

<h3 id="beginners-seminar">Beginners seminar</h3>

<p>A half-day course for those either new to the subject or who only require a broad overview. This event is held approximately eight times a year, at regional venues as well as in London.</p>

<h3 id="intermediate-seminar">Intermediate seminar</h3>

<p>A full-day event comprising a series of formal presentations. It is aimed at those who already have a basic knowledge of the controls and/or those who only require a broad overview. This workshop is held approximately eight times a year, at regional venues as well as in London.</p>

<p>Please note that although Beginners and Intermediate events are held on consecutive days at a particular venue, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> do not recommend attendance at both as the material covered is similar and there is a necessary degree of repetition. The intermediate course covers the same information as the beginners but goes into more detail on each topic. It is helpful if you think about what you need to achieve from the course before deciding which level is best.</p>

<h3 id="making-better-licence-applications-workshop">Making better licence applications workshop</h3>

<p>On this half-day workshop, attendees will be taken step-by-step through the licence application process on SPIRE (the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s licence application database). These workshops are held in London at approximately six week intervals.</p>

<h3 id="control-list-classification-and-use-of-the-checker-tools">Control list classification and use of the checker tools</h3>

<p>This is a full-day workshop. The objective is to give attendees confidence in identifying control list entries that specify their products. It is aimed at those who already have some knowledge of the rating process - those who are not very familiar with export controls would benefit from attending a more general course first.</p>

<p>Separate workshops are held on classifying military and dual-use goods. Please ensure you register for the appropriate event. These workshops are held in London at approximately six week intervals.</p>

<h3 id="open-licence-and-compliance-workshop">Open licence and compliance workshop</h3>

<p>This full day workshop covers the use of both Open General Licences (<abbr title="Open General Licences">OGLs</abbr>) and Open Individual Export LIcences (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>). It also includes practical aspects of demonstrating compliance with these licences. The event is held annually in London.</p>

<h3 id="trade-control-seminar">Trade control seminar</h3>

<p>This half day seminar covers the structure of the revised Trade Controls relating to the movement of military goods, types of goods and activities subject to control (including the provision of transport services), trade licences and compliance/enforcement. The seminar also covers controls on transhipment and goods in transit.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-cryptographic-products-seminar">Exporting cryptographic products seminar</h3>

<p>This half day seminar focuses specifically on issues arising from the export of products (goods and software) with encryption capability and associated technology transfers. It covers issues such as rating of crypto products, including the interpretation of the Cryptography Note and other notes to control entry 5A002, licensing of cryptographic products and specific record keeping, registration and compliance issues.</p>

<p>The course is delivered with the active participation of the UK’s National Technical Authority for Information Assurance (CESG, part of GCHQ).</p>

<h2 id="export-control-films">Export Control Films</h2>

<p>The Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>), has produced two films which provide a short overview about strategic export controls and your responsibilities as an exporter of controlled military or dual-use items.</p>

<h3 id="responsible-exports">Responsible exports</h3>

<p>A short eight minute introductory film which emphasises that export control is a serious responsiblity which affects us all. It explains briefly what is controlled and why. It also outlines the criteria against which all licence applications are judged. Find out more and take appropriate action where necessary.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSjp3kX_s0g&amp;feature=player_embedded">Watch a video about your export control responsibilities and how you can ensure you have the correct licences on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="open-licence-audits-explained">Open Licence Audits Explained</h3>

<p>This film explains what to expect from and how to prepare for <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> Compliance Audits. These audits are a requirement of exporters registered for either an Open General Licence (<abbr title="Open General Licence">OGL</abbr>), <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> General Export Authorisation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="European Union General Export Authorisation">GEA</abbr>) or Open Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>).</p>

<p>The film emphasises best practice in compliance with open licences. It features interviews with Compliance Audit Officers and also features a fictional company faced with an audit, to demonstrate what to expect from the process.</p>
