<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>All exports of military goods from the UK to any destination (including the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) require an export licence issued by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>). Regulations, charges or other restrictions may apply to aerospace and defence exports as they leave the UK and when they arrive at their destination country.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">online UK Trade Tariff tool</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="export-regulations-in-the-aerospace-and-defence-sector">Export regulations in the aerospace and defence sector</h2>

<p>Many countries in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and throughout the world have specific legislation covering the import of defence and aerospace goods. It’s important to research both sides of the transaction.</p>

<p>Where UK companies have operations outside the UK local laws apply as well. So if your UK defence company operates a manufacturing plant in the US, its exports will be subject to US border controls.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu">exporting your goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to a third country</a> and dispatching your goods within the EU.</p>

<p>Dangerous goods must be transported in line with regulations - see moving your goods and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-dangerous-goods">moving dangerous goods</a>.</p>

<p>Run by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> (HM Revenue &amp; Customs), the Authorised Economic Operator (<abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr>) scheme allows registered companies to take advantage of the simplified customs procedures that relate to the security and safety of their goods in transit. Read the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/authorised-economic-operator-certification">authorised economic operators</a>.</p>

<p>The UK-US Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty, which is aimed at improving the support which UK and US industry can provide jointly to their armed forces operating in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere; is currently under discussion. The treaty is yet to be approved by the US.</p>

<h3 id="restrictions-and-charges">Restrictions and charges</h3>

<p>First, you need to classify your goods. Use of standardised classification codes makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply. You can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff" title="Integrated Tariff of the UK">Integrated Tariff of the UK</a> to classify your goods.</p>

<h3 id="export-licensing-and-certification">Export licensing and certification</h3>

<p>Most countries have specific legislation covering the import of defence and aerospace goods, and you must also comply with these regulations.</p>

<p>All dispatches of military goods to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> require an export licence issued by the The Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>), part of the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>, which regulates the export of such goods, technology and software..</p>

<p>Standard individual export licences for military goods to member states are now checked by customs officers at inland <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> offices as there’s no need for customs declarations for such exports. A copy of the licence must accompany your goods. For military goods exported to a member state under open licences, your commercial documentation must include details of the licence to help with any frontier checks.</p>

<h2 id="export-licences-for-military-and-dual-use-goods">Export licences for military and dual-use goods</h2>

<p>Military and certain dual-use goods (ie items not specifically designed for military purposes but that could be used as such) need an export or trade licence to leave the UK. </p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/policies/export-control-organisation/eco-training-skills-academy/eco-films">Watch a video about your export control responsibilities and how you can ensure you have the correct licences on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-uk-military-list">The UK Military List</h3>

<p>The UK Military List details all licensed military items. You can use it to check if your goods need a licence. You should also consult the Consolidated UK Export Control Lists, which incorporate this Military List and the UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> dual-use lists. See: <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">introduction to the UK Strategic Export Control Lists</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.co.uk/goodsChecker">Check if your goods need a licence on the GoodsChecker website (registration required)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dual-use-and-end-use-goods">Dual-use and end-use goods</h3>

<p>Items that haven’t been specifically designed for a military purpose but that could be used for such a purpose because of the high specification are classed as ‘dual-use’ and may require a licence.</p>

<p>Any goods involved in handling, operation, maintenance, storage, detection, identification or the spread of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons also need a licence, as do goods that are not included in the Strategic Export Control List, but that may be used in a weapons-of-mass-destruction context.</p>

<p>Some exports not on the Military List may need an export licence under the military end-use control. This applies if the exporter has been informed that the goods are to be used for a military purpose in a country under an arms embargo, or informed that they’re to be used for illegal weapons.</p>

<h3 id="arms-embargoes">Arms embargoes</h3>

<p>You need to be aware of both the UK controls and the international trade sanctions or arms embargoes against particular countries or regions. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions">current arms embargoes and other restrictions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="trade-controls">Trade controls</h3>

<p>As a result of the Export Control Act the trading of military goods abroad is also a licensable activity. The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> also licenses the trafficking and brokering of military goods between destinations. This involves transactions between two overseas countries where the deal is brokered or conducted in the UK.</p>

<p>Trade controls apply to all activities undertaken from within the UK and in certain circumstances to activities undertaken by UK persons while overseas. The legislation also controls activities of the transport sector concerning transport of military items.</p>

<p>Trade controls also apply to the brokering - which can include warehousing and shipping - of dual-use goods that could be used in connection with weapons of mass destruction. Whistle-blowing measures also apply.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-controls-on-controlled-military-goods">trafficking and brokering (trade controls)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ministry-of-defence-mod-f680-clearance">Ministry of Defence (MOD) F680 clearance</h3>

<p>The MOD F680 is a pre-clearance check that is required if an exporter plans to sell, demonstrate or promote or export certain equipment, goods or classified information for export promotion purposes. The F680 process gives an indication but not a guarantee that an export licence will subsequently be issued. You must obtain F680 clearance in order to use certain licences. For more information, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/mod-f680-applications">MOD F680 applications</a>.</p>

<p>Traders must allow enough time to apply and receive a licence before exporting goods. While the process can sometimes be completed in a few weeks, <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> will need longer to issue some licences.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-export-licence">Types of export licence</h3>

<p>There are currently seven types of licence issued by <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. The most common licences are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open General Export Licence (<abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr>) - these licences are specifically designed to ease the licensing burden on companies and should be considered if possible, if all terms and conditions can be met. They permit the export of specified controlled goods that have been assessed as lower strategic risk and to lower risk destinations. There are currently over 40 different types of <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> available which licence exports of either military or dual-use goods. There is also an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> equivalent of an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> called the Community General Export Authorisation (<abbr title="Community General Export Authorisation">CGEA</abbr>) which licenses certain dual-use goods. Exporters need to register for most <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> via the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s SPIRE export licensing database. All <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> holders should expect periodic <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> Compliance Audits. While <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> stay in force until they’re revoked, their provisions can vary at any time, so exporters must stay up to date with changes via the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s Notices to Exporters email alert service. <a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.co.uk/ogelChecker/">Check if you can use an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> for your goods on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> Checker website (registration required)</a>.</li>
  <li>Standard Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>) - allows export of a specific quantity of a certain good to a named importer. If you are not permitted to use an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> due to the nature of the goods or export destination (for instance, because you intend to export a controlled item to a sanctioned country), then you need to apply for an <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Open Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>) - issued for a specific exporter and allows different goods to be sent to various destinations. This is a concessionary licence. You need a track record with <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> before being issued with an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before either registering for an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> or when applying for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>, <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> or other type of export licence, you should be careful to avoid errors in your application, since this could cause delays. For instance you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>understand what is licensable</li>
  <li>understand how to correctly rate your goods (ie check the goods entry in the UK Strategic Export Control List)</li>
  <li>ensure that you fully understand the requirements, terms and conditions of all licences</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/submitting-export-licence-applications-correctly">common pitfalls in export licence applications</a>.</p>

<p>Export licence applications can be made via SPIRE, which is the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s electronic system for processing licence applications. You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/spire-the-basics">apply for an export licence on SPIRE with <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="research-your-export-destination-in-the-aerospace-and-defence-sector">Research your export destination in the aerospace and defence sector</h2>

<p>You should thoroughly research your export destination country when planning to export.</p>

<p>There are a number of issues that you ought to consider. As a starting point you may wish to seek advice from UK Trade &amp; Investment (<abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr>). <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/unitedkingdom/contactus.html">Find your local international trade team on the <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>There are also various ways that you can research a potential export destination. These include trade associations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">online UK Trade Tariff tool</a>.</p>

<p>You should also consider product safety and other technical standards in your export market. Your goods may need to be adapted to comply with these. Rules in your export market may be less or more strict than in the UK.</p>

<p>You should be aware of any sanctions and embargoes in force on your potential export destination. For information see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/sanctions-embargoes-and-restrictions">sanctions, embargoes and restrictions</a> and for more specific detail see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions">current arms embargoes and other restrictions</a>.</p>

<p>You can ask for information about your export destination country from a range of organisations, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>your local <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> trade team</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="UK Trade &amp; Investment">UKTI</abbr> team within the commercial section of the UK embassy in your destination country</li>
  <li>aerospace and defence sector trade associations</li>
  <li>the Chambers of Commerce in the UK and in your destination country</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tariffs-and-duties-in-the-aerospace-and-defence-sector">Tariffs and duties in the aerospace and defence sector</h2>

<p>There is a range of import regulations that must be complied with by all businesses in this sector. These include the Tariff, VAT and duties, Intrastat and intellectual property.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-integrated-tariff">Using the Integrated Tariff</h3>

<p>A common customs tariff is applied across all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on goods imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Details of specific tariff duties and measures are contained in the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Tariff is used to determine the specific classification code of your goods and to find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>any licensing requirements that apply (although note the requirements to check the UK Strategic Export Control Lists if necessary)</li>
  <li>the rates of duty and import VAT that apply</li>
  <li>any additional charges, such as anti-dumping duties</li>
  <li>any available preferential duty rates</li>
</ul>
<div class="call-to-action">

</div>

<h3 id="preferential-rates-of-duty">Preferential rates of duty</h3>

<p>The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) allows products from a wide range of countries to be imported in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> at a reduced or zero rate of duty.</p>

<p>The European Community (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) has a number of other trade agreements with third (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) countries, as a result of which goods may attract preferential rates of duty.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000193">Find out if your goods qualify for a preferential rate of duty and meet the appropriate rules of origin on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="intrastat">Intrastat</h3>

<p>Intrastat is the method of collecting information and producing statistics on goods traded between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/intrastat-duty-to-report-statistics">Intrastat - reporting the value and volume of intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade</a>. Intrastat is only applicable to VAT-registered traders.</p>

<p>If you are VAT registered and the goods you acquire from or supply to VAT registered businesses in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries reach the Intrastat exemption threshold for the year, you must submit monthly supplementary declarations to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Intrastat thresholds are reviewed annually. The 2012 thresholds are £600,000 for arrivals and £250,000 for dispatches.</p>

<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual property</h3>

<p>You should ensure that imported goods do not breach the intellectual rights of other businesses, eg watch out for counterfeit goods and design infringements. Infringing goods can be seized and destroyed by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You can ask <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to check for imported counterfeit versions of your goods. For more information, see <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1077717231&amp;r.l3=1078078901&amp;topicId=1073948358">intellectual property protection overseas</a>.  </p>

<h2 id="import-regulations-in-the-aerospace-and-defence-sector">Import regulations in the aerospace and defence sector</h2>

<p>Import restrictions can be product-specific or trade-specific. Many products are subject to product-specific standards and need to be supported by applicable certificates, product-specific licences and documentation.</p>

<p>Quite separately, quantitative restrictions or limitations and anti-dumping duties may apply to certain imported commodities. For more information, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/anti-dumping-duty-to-protect-eu-businesses-against-cheap-imports">anti-dumping duty to protect <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> businesses against cheap imports</a>.</p>

<p>For help identifying whether you require an import licence see: <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">Do your goods need an export licence?</a></p>

<p>Goods imported to the UK must comply with domestic business standards, including product safety standards and conditions of sale. Find out how to comply with aerospace and defence regulations: <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/aerospace-and-defence-import-and-export-regulations">Aerospace and defence import and export regulations</a>.</p>

<p>Run by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, the <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> scheme allows registered companies to take advantage of the simplified customs procedures that relate to the security and safety of their goods in transit. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/authorised-economic-operator-certification">authorised economic operators</a>.</p>

<h3 id="import-licences-and-certificates">Import licences and certificates</h3>

<p>As the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is a customs union you can buy some goods, except firearms and ammunition, from other member countries without restrictions, although VAT and excise duty can still apply. However, most member states operate their own import controls on aerospace and defence goods and it’s likely your import may be subject to regulation. You can also see more on VAT on goods from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1077717231&amp;r.l3=1078078901&amp;topicId=1083237911">imports and purchases from abroad: paying and reclaiming VAT</a>.</p>

<p>If you import from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you may have to comply with import licensing requirements for firearms and ammunition and with common customs tariffs that apply across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for all goods. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/importing-goods-from-outside-the-eu">importing your goods from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Importers of firearms and ammunition need to apply to the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> import licensing branch for a licence to import. Import licences are only issued to those with domestic authority to possess. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/trade-policy-unit/importing-into-uk/import-licensing-branch">Read about the goods that need <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> import licences on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (<abbr title="Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls">CoCom</abbr>) countries include most of Europe, the US and Japan. If you import controlled goods from a <abbr title="Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls">CoCom</abbr> country into the UK, you may need an import licence and an International Import Certificate (<abbr title="International Import Certificate">IIC</abbr>). IICs cannot be used as stand-ins for import licences.</p>

<p>If you’re asked to do so by the licensing authority of one of these countries, you must apply for an <abbr title="International Import Certificate">IIC</abbr>. The <abbr title="International Import Certificate">IIC</abbr> gives an undertaking by the importer to import the goods into the destination country specified, without a diversion or transhipment, and not to re-export the goods without an export licence from the licensing authority in that country. IICs are available from certain UK Chambers of Commerce. <a rel="external" href="http://www.chamber-international.co.uk/services/documentation/international_import_certificate/">Find information about IICs at the Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="banned-and-controlled-goods">Banned and controlled goods</h3>

<p>It is forbidden to import anti-personnel mines and instruments of torture or execution. Some weapons are also forbidden, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>knuckle-dusters</li>
  <li>flick knives</li>
  <li>martial arts weapons, eg ‘death stars’ and ‘swordsticks’</li>
  <li>knives with a concealed blade or sharp point, eg belt-buckle blades</li>
  <li>high-voltage electric ‘stun guns’</li>
  <li>pepper sprays and CS gas (‘tear gas’) canisters</li>
  <li>high-powered air rifles</li>
  <li>cluster munitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Importing these weapons can mean a prison sentence.</p>

<p>The import of hand guns is strictly regulated by <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>. Import licensing requirements for these weapons are strict.</p>

<h2 id="duty-reliefs-for-imports-of-aerospace-and-defence-products">Duty reliefs for imports of aerospace and defence products</h2>

<p>Processing under Customs Control (<abbr title="Processing under Customs Control">PCC</abbr>) was set up to encourage processing in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by allowing certain raw materials or components to be imported under duty-suspension arrangements. You must be authorised to use <abbr title="Processing under Customs Control">PCC</abbr>, be able to show customs officers your contract with the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MoD</abbr>) and supply details of the processing manufacturer.</p>

<p>Other customs procedures with economic benefits include inward processing (IP), outward processing relief, customs warehousing, free zones, and types of temporary importation including ATA and CPD carnets. The schemes delay or suspend the payment of import duties. Under some relief schemes, such as IP, you can also avoid paying import VAT. Read about customs procedures with economic impact in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-declarations-and-the-national-export-system-export-procedures">export declarations and the National Export System</a>.</p>

<p>The Certificate of Airworthiness scheme allows you to claim duty relief on parts imported with a certificate authorised by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> aviation authorities or third-country (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) authorities. You can claim relief on:</p>

<ul>
<li>parts, components and other goods with the certificate falling within the Tariff chapters 25 to 97</li>
  <li>goods intended for re-export within a specified time</li>
  <li>some goods imported for use in authorised aircraft spare-parts depots</li>
</ul>
<p>End-use relief provides relief from duty. To claim relief for military equipment you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>obtain additional authorisation and a certificate issued by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MoD</abbr> or equivalent <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state</li>
  <li>be importing goods for use by or on behalf of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state’s military forces</li>
</ul>
<p>As a sub-contractor you must be authorised to use the reference number of the imported goods certificate.</p>
