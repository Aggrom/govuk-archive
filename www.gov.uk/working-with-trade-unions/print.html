  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you <a href="/recognise-a-trade-union" title="recognise a union">recognise a union</a> in your workplace there are certain rules you need to follow.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>give the union information in advance to help with <a href="/working-with-trade-unions/collective-bargaining" title="collective bargaining">collective bargaining</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="/working-with-trade-unions/informing-and-consulting-with-unions" title="inform and consult the union">inform and consult the union</a> about major changes in the workplace</li>
  <li>follow proper procedures if you’re <a href="/working-with-trade-unions/union-subscriptions" title="taking union subscriptions">taking union subscriptions</a> straight from your employees’ pay (the ‘check off’)</li>

</li>
  <li>not discriminate against a worker because they’re in the union</li>
</ul></article><article id="collective-bargaining"><header><h1>Part 2: Collective bargaining</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need to work with unions to discuss changes to your employees’ terms and conditions. This is called ‘collective bargaining’.</p>

<p>Collective bargaining covers the terms and conditions of workers in a defined ‘bargaining unit’. This can include all employees in a workplace or just certain groups of workers, eg technicians.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It’s up to you and the union to agree which terms and conditions are covered but it’s usually things like pay, holiday, working hours etc.</p>
</div>

<h2>Running collective bargaining</h2>

<p>Employers and unions need to work out how to run collective bargaining, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>who’ll represent the workers</li>
  <li>who’s included in a bargaining unit</li>
  <li>when and how often meetings will happen</li>
  <li>what to do if more than one union is recognised</li>
  <li>what will be discussed</li>
  <li>what to do if the union and employer can’t come to an agreement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information to help with collective bargaining</h2>

<p>Employers must give certain information to the union to help it with the bargaining process, eg the company’s pay and benefits structure or information about its profits, assets and liabilities.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=273&amp;p=0" title="Download the 'Acas code of practice on disclosure of information to trade unions for collective bargaining' (PDF, 469KB)" rel="external">Download the ‘<abbr title="Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> code of practice on disclosure of information to trade unions for collective bargaining’ (PDF, 469KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Collective agreements</h2>

<p>If collective bargaining leads to an agreement, for example about a pay increase or change in working conditions, it’s called a ‘collective agreement’.</p>


</article><article id="informing-and-consulting-with-unions"><header><h1>Part 3: Informing and consulting with unions</h1>
  </header><p>Employers must inform and consult with a recognised trade union about:</p>

<ul>
<li>collective redundancies</li>
  <li>transfers of business ownership</li>
  <li>certain changes to pension schemes</li>
  <li>health and safety</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you fail to consult the union about any of these, you’ll be breaking the law and could be fined - the amount depends on the situation.</p>
</div>

<p>There’s more information on the pension scheme changes you have to consult about in the guidance below.</p>

</div>

<p>You can also make voluntary agreements with unions to regularly inform and consult them about other business and workplace issues.</p>

</article><article id="union-subscriptions"><header><h1>Part 4: Union subscriptions</h1>
  </header><p>Some trade union members pay their union subscriptions directly out of their wages.</p>

<p>The employer then gives these payments to the union.</p>

<p>This is often called the ‘check-off’.</p>

<p>It’s up to you if you want to run the check-off. You can’t be forced to run the check-off unless you’ve agreed to in your workers’ employment contracts.</p>

<h2>Authorising the check-off</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A worker must give you written permission to take their union subscriptions from their wages.</p>
</div>

<p>This must be signed and dated. Their permission starts from this date and continues until they say otherwise.</p>

<p>If you take the check-off without proper permission you could be taken to an employment tribunal.</p>

<p>You can pre-print consent forms as long as the worker signs and dates the form themselves. Unions are also allowed to get the written consent from the worker then forward it to you.</p>

<h2>Stopping the check-off</h2>

<p>You must stop taking check-off payments if your employee asks you to.</p>

<p>They must give you written notice to stop the check-off and you must be given reasonable time to stop it.</p>

<p>You can stop running the check-off at any time. If it’s in your workers’ employment contracts, you may have to give them notice.</p>

<h2>The role of the union in the check-off</h2>

<p>The union doesn’t have to help run the check-off. However, you can involve it if you want to. You could, for example, ask the union to help you get initial consent from its members.</p>

<p>You could also charge the union for the work involved in administering the check off.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Even if you involve the union in the check-off, it’s still your responsibility to make sure you make check-off deductions properly.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="rights-of-employees-in-trade-unions-"><header><h1>Part 5: Rights of employees in trade unions </h1>
  </header><p>If you <a href="/recognise-a-trade-union" title="recognise a union">recognise a union</a>, it will normally name one or more of your workers as its local workplace representatives (‘reps’).</p>

<p>Union reps have certain <a href="/rights-of-trade-union-reps" title="rights of trade union reps">rights</a>. They’re allowed reasonable time off work:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>with pay</strong> for union duties and training at appropriate times</li>
  <li>
<strong>without pay</strong> to take part in union activities, eg the union’s annual conference (trade union members are entitled to this as well)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Reasonable time off doesn’t have to taken as annual leave.</p>
</div>

<h2>Blacklisting</h2>

<p>You can’t discriminate against anyone because they’re in the union or because of their union activity.</p>

<p>With rare exceptions, it’s also illegal to compile, use, sell or supply a ‘blacklist’ of union members that will be used to discriminate against them.</p>
