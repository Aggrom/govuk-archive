  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Criminal Records Bureau (<abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>) is now called the Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) - <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> checks are now called <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks.</p>
</div>

<p>A <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check may be needed for:</p>

<ul>
<li>certain jobs or voluntary work - like working with children, or in healthcare</li>
  <li>applying to foster or adopt a child</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are different rules for getting a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check in <a href="http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/apply/employers/" title="Disclosure Scotland" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a href="http://www.dojni.gov.uk/accessni" title="Access Northern Ireland" rel="external">Northern Ireland.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Who can ask for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check</h2>

<p>Normally, employers aren’t allowed to ask job applicants about spent convictions, but for jobs that need a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check this rule doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> eligibility guidance lists most roles that are eligible for a check. However, the guidance isn’t comprehensive, and you should <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check/contact-disclosure-and-barring-service" title="Contact the DBS">contact the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr></a> if you’re unsure.</p>

</div>

<p>If you’re the person being checked - ‘the applicant’ - the employer will give you a form to fill in and return to them along with <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check/documents-the-applicant-must-provide-" title="documents proving your identity">documents proving your identity</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t do a criminal records check on yourself.</p>
</div>

<p>If you need to run a check on yourself, you can get a ‘basic disclosure’ with details of any unspent convictions from <a rel="external" href="http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/apply-online/" title="Apply online for Basic Disclosure">Disclosure Scotland</a> (anywhere in the UK).</p>

<h2>Types of criminal records check</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of check. The employer or organisation running the check should provide the applicant with more information about the level of check required.</p>

<p>Checks for eligible volunteers are free of charge. This includes anyone who spends time helping people and:</p>

<ul>
<li>isn’t being paid (apart from travel and <a href="/volunteering/pay-and-expenses" title="Volunteering - pay and expenses">basic expenses</a>)</li>
  <li>isn’t just looking after a close relative</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>An employer must not apply for a check unless the job or role is eligible for one. They must tell the applicant why they’re being checked, and where they can get independent advice.</p>

</div>

<p>The person going through a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check - ‘the applicant’ - must give their employer original documents proving their identity. The documents needed will depend on the route the application takes. The applicant must try to provide documents from route 1 first.</p>

<h2>Route 1</h2>

<p>The applicant must be able to show:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 document from Table 1, below </li>
  <li>2 other documents from either Table 1 or Table 2a or 2b, below</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the documents must show the applicant’s current address.</p>

<h2>Route 2</h2>

<p>If the applicant doesn’t have any of the documents in Table 1, then they must be able to show:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 document from Table 2a</li>
  <li>2 other documents from either Table 2a or 2b</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the documents must show the applicant’s current address. The organisation conducting their ID check must then also use an appropriate external ID validation service to check the application.</p>

<h2>Route 3</h2>

<p>Route 3 can only be used if it hasn’t been possible to process the application through Routes 1 or 2.</p>

<p>For Route 3, the applicant must be able to show: </p>

<ul>
<li>a birth certificate issued after the time of birth (UK and Channel Islands)</li>
  <li>1 document from Table 2a</li>
  <li>3 further documents from Table 2a or 2b</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the documents must show the applicant’s current address. If the applicant can’t provide these documents they may need to be fingerprinted.</p>

</div>

<p>The person being given a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check - ‘the applicant’ - can check on the progress of their application using the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://secure.crbonline.gov.uk/enquiry/enquirySearch.do" title="tracking service">tracking service.</a></p>

<p>The applicant, employer and organisation that applied for the search will see the results of the check.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate</h2>

<p>Once the check is completed, the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> will send a certificate listing the results to both the applicant and the authorised person requesting the check. </p>

<h3>Security features</h3>

<p>Certificates have security features to prove they’re genuine:</p>

<ul>
<li>a ‘crown seal’ watermark repeated down the right hand side, visible both on the surface and when holding it up to the light</li>
  <li>a background design featuring the word ‘Disclosure’, which appears in a wave-like pattern across both sides of the certificate; the pattern’s colour alternates between blue and green on the reverse of the certificate</li>
  <li>ink and paper that change colour when wet</li>
</ul>
<p>Certificates printed by the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> have these security features, but ones sent by email don’t.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The security features for a <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> certificate issued before 1 December 2012 are the same as for the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate.</p>
</div>

<h3>Reusing a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate only contains information from a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check on a certain date and for a particular purpose. It can be accepted at a later date, but the employer will have to decide if it’s recent enough or suitable for the current purpose.</p>

<p>It’s also up to the employer to check that the applicant’s identity matches the details on the certificate.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>-branded certificates should be treated the same as <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>-branded certificates.</p>
</div>

<h3>If the applicant loses the certificate</h3>

<p>If the applicant loses the certificate, or it’s destroyed, the <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> can’t provide a replacement.</p>

<h3>If there’s a mistake on the certificate</h3>

<p>If the certificate contains incorrect personal details or criminal record information, the applicant should let the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> know as soon as possible using the disputes form.</p>

</div>

<p>Employers should only arrange a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check on a successful job applicant. They can withdraw a job offer if the results show anything that would make the applicant unsuitable.</p>

<p>Employers who need to do fewer than 100 checks a year can use an <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/dbs/services/ub/" title="umbrella body">umbrella body.</a></p>

<h2>Registering with the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Employers who need to do more than 100 checks a year can deal with their own applications if they <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check/contact-disclosure-and-barring-service" title="contact the DBS to register">register with the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr></a>. This costs £300, plus £5 for each additional ‘counter signatory’ (people within an organisation who are allowed to handle <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> applications).</p>

<p>Registered organisations must follow the <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/dbs/dbs-checking-service-guidance/cop" title="DBS code of practice"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> code of practice.</a></p>

<h3>The e-Bulk service</h3>

<p>Employers who need to do more than 1,500 checks a year can use the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> e-Bulk service, which can help reduce costs and waiting times for <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks.</p>

<p>Employers providing care services for adults - eg in a care home - can use a service called <a rel="external" href="https://www.isaadultfirst.co.uk/guidance.aspx/" title="DBS Adult First"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> Adult First.</a></p>

<p>This will confirm, usually within 2 days, if the applicant:</p>

<ul>
<li>can start work, as long as they’re supervised</li>
  <li>should wait for the results of an enhanced check</li>
</ul>
<p>The service costs an extra £6.</p>

<h2>Employers in Scotland or Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>Employers in Scotland can get a criminal records check from <a rel="external" href="http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/apply/employers/" title="Apply for a disclosure">Disclosure Scotland,</a> while employers in Northern Ireland should go through <a rel="external" href="http://www.dojni.gov.uk/accessni" title="Apply for a disclosure">Access NI.</a></p>

<h2>Overseas applicants</h2>

<p>If the applicant is from overseas, the employer can ask their <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/foreign-embassies-in-uk/" title="foreign embassy">foreign embassy</a> if it can get a similar check done in their country.</p>

<h2>Employing ex-offenders</h2>

<p>If you carry out criminal records checks, you must have a policy on employing ex-offenders. You must show it to any applicant who asks for it.</p>

</div>

<p>Jobs that involve caring for, supervising or being in sole charge of children or adults require an enhanced DBS check (previously called an enhanced <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> check). </p>

<p>This includes checking whether someone is included in the 2 DBS ‘barred lists’ (previously called <abbr title="Independent Safeguarding Authority">ISA</abbr> barred lists) of individuals who are unsuitable for working with:</p>

<li>children</li>
  <li>adults</li>

<h2>Referring someone to the DBS</h2>

<p>Employers must refer someone to the DBS if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>sacked them because they harmed a child or adult</li>
  <li>sacked them because they might have harmed a child or adult otherwise</li>
  <li>were planning to sack them for either of these reasons, but the person resigned first</li>
