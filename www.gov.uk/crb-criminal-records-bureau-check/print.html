</div>

<p>If you’re the person being checked - ‘the applicant’ - your employer will give you a form to fill in and return to them along with <a href="/crb-criminal-records-bureau-check/documents-the-applicant-must-provide" title="documents proving your identity">documents proving your identity</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t do a criminal records check on yourself.</p>

<h2>Types of criminal records check</h2>

<p>There are 2 types of check - the employer decides the level of check needed.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Type of check and cost</th>
      <th>What it will check for</th>
      <th>How long it normally takes</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Standard - £26</td>
      <td>Spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands, final warnings</td>
      <td>About 2 weeks</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Enhanced - £44</td>
      <td>As above - plus information from local police records</td>
      <td>About 4 weeks</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Checks for volunteers are usually free of charge.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>An employer must not apply for a check unless the job needs one, and must tell the applicant why they’re being checked.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="documents-the-applicant-must-provide-"><header><h1>Part 2: Documents the applicant must provide </h1>
  </header><p>The person going through a Criminal Records Bureau (<abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>) check - ‘the applicant’ - must give their employer original documents proving their identity. The documents needed will depend on the route the application takes. The applicant must try to provide documents from route 1 first.</p>

<h2>Route 1</h2>

<p>The applicant must be able to show:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 document from Table 1, below </li>
  <li>2 other documents from either Table 1 or Table 2a or 2b, below</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the documents must show the applicant’s current address.</p>

<h2>Route 2</h2>

<p>If the applicant doesn’t have any of the documents in Table 1, then they must be able to show:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 document from Table 2a</li>
  <li>2 other documents from either Table 2a or 2b</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the documents must show the applicant’s current address. The organisation conducting their ID check must then also use an appropriate external ID validation service to check the application.</p>

<h2>Route 3</h2>

<p>Route 3 can only be used if it hasn’t been possible to process the application through Routes 1 or 2.</p>

<p>For Route 3, the applicant must be able to show: </p>

<ul>
<li>an original copy of their birth certificate (UK &amp; Channel Islands)</li>
  <li>1 document from Table 2a</li>
  <li>3 further documents from Table 2a or 2b</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the documents must show the applicant’s current address. If the applicant can’t provide these documents they may need to be fingerprinted.</p>

  </header><p>The person being given a Criminal Records Bureau (<abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>) check - ‘the applicant’ - can check on the progress of their application using the <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://secure.crbonline.gov.uk/enquiry/enquirySearch.do" title="tracking service">tracking service.</a></p>

<p>The applicant, employer and organisation that applied for the search will see the results of the check.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> certificate</h2>

<p>Once the check is completed, the <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> will send a certificate listing the results to both the applicant and the authorised person requesting the check. </p>

<h3>Security features</h3>

<p>Certificates have security features to prove they’re genuine:</p>

<ul>
<li>a ‘crown seal’ watermark repeated down the right hand side, visible both on the surface and when holding it up to the light</li>
  <li>a background design featuring the word ‘Disclosure’, which appears in a wave-like pattern across both sides of the certificate; the pattern’s colour alternates between blue and green on the reverse of the certificate</li>
  <li>ink and paper that change colour when wet</li>
</ul>
<p>Certificates printed by the <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> have these security features, but ones sent by email don’t.</p>

<h3>Expiration</h3>

<p>Although a <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> certificate doesn’t expire, it only contains information from a <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> check on a certain date and for a particular purpose. It can be accepted at a later date, but the employer will have to decide if it’s recent enough or suitable for the current purpose.</p>

<h3>If the applicant loses the certificate</h3>

<p>If the applicant loses the certificate, or it’s destroyed, the <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> can’t provide a replacement.</p>

<h3>If there’s a mistake on the certificate</h3>

<p>If the certificate contains incorrect personal details or criminal record information, the applicant should let the <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> know as soon as possible using the ‘Certificate disputes form’.</p>

  </header><p>Employers should only arrange a Criminal Records Bureau (<abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>) check on a successful job applicant. Employers who need to do fewer than 100 checks a year can use an <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/crb/about-crb/what-we-do/ub-search/" title="umbrella body">umbrella body.</a></p>

<p>Employers who need to do more than 1,500 checks a year can use the <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>’s e-Bulk service, which can help reduce costs and waiting times for <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> checks.</p>

<h2>Checks on carers</h2>

<p>Employers providing care services for adults - eg in a care home - can use a service called <a rel="external" href="https://www.isaadultfirst.co.uk/guidance.aspx/" title="Adult First">Adult First.</a></p>

<p>This will confirm, usually within 2 days, if the applicant:</p>

<ul>
<li>can start work, as long as they’re supervised</li>
  <li>should wait for the results of an enhanced check</li>
</ul>
<p>The service costs an extra £6.</p>

<h2>Employers in Scotland or Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>Employers in Scotland can get a criminal records check from <a rel="external" href="http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/apply/employers/" title="Apply for a disclosure">Disclosure Scotland</a>, while ones in Northern Ireland should go through <a rel="external" href="http://www.dojni.gov.uk/accessni" title="Apply for a disclosure">Access NI.</a></p>

<h2>Overseas applicants</h2>

<p>If the applicant is from overseas, the employer can ask their <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/foreign-embassies-in-uk/" title="foreign embassy">foreign embassy</a> if it can get a similar check done in their country.</p>

<h2>Employing ex-offenders</h2>

<p>If you carry out criminal records checks, you must have a policy on employing ex-offenders. You must show it to any applicant who asks for it.</p>
