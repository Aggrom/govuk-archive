  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-you-may-get"><header><h1>Part 1: What you may get</h1>
  </header><p>If you defer your State Pension you may get extra money. You could get this as either extra State Pension or a lump sum payment.</p>

<h2>Extra State Pension</h2>

<p>If you put off claiming your State Pension for at least 5 weeks you may earn extra State Pension. Your State Pension will increase by 1% for every 5 weeks you put off claiming. This is the same as 10.4% for every full year you put off claiming. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If you get the full State Pension of £107.45 per week, this will work out to £581 per year.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you claim your State Pension, any extra State Pension you have built up will usually increase each year.</p>

<h2>Lump sum payment</h2>

<p>If you put off claiming your State Pension for at least 12 months in a row, you may choose to get a one-off lump sum payment.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your extra State Pension counts as income and you have to pay tax on it. Your lump sum is taxed at the highest tax rate that applies to your other income.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="how-to-defer-your-state-pension"><header><h1>Part 2: How to defer your State Pension</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to defer then don’t send in your pension claim form when you get it. Your State Pension will be automatically deferred until <a href="/state-pension/how-to-claim" title="claim your State Pension">you claim it</a>.</p>

<h2>If you get benefits</h2>
<p>You’ll need to tell <a href="/contact-pension-service" title="Contact the Pension Service">The Pension Service</a> you want to defer.</p>

<h2>If you’re already getting your State Pension</h2>
<p>If you want to stop claiming your State Pension, you should <a href="/find-pension-centre" title="find your nearest pension centre">contact your pension centre.</a></p>

</article><article id="extra-state-pension-and-lump-sum-payments"><header><h1>Part 3: Extra State Pension and lump sum payments</h1>
  </header><h2>Extra State Pension</h2>

<p>If you’re getting means tested benefits, then extra State Pension will count as income and will affect these benefits, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pension Credit </li>
  <li>Housing Benefit </li>
  <li>Council Tax Benefit </li>
  <li>Tax credits</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re deferring your State Pension, you won’t build up any extra State Pension or lump sum payments for the days you’re also receiving any of the following benefits: </p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support </li>
  <li>Pension Credit </li>
  <li>Employment Support Allowance (income related)  </li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance (income based)</li>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance </li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit </li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance </li>
  <li>Widow’s Pension </li>
  <li>Widowed Mother’s Allowance </li>
  <li>Unemployability Supplement </li>
  <li>any type of State Pension</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re deferring your State Pension, you won’t build up any extra State Pension for the days your partner is getting any of the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support </li>
  <li>Pension Credit </li>
  <li>Employment Support Allowance (income related)  </li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance (income based) </li>
</ul>
<p>If you get Graduated Retirement Benefit or Shared Additional Pension, these days will count towards your extra State Pension or lump sum. </p>

<h2>Lump sum payments</h2>
<p>If you choose a lump sum payment and claim Pension Credit, Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit, these benefits will not be affected.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You won’t build up extra State Pension or lump sum payments for any days you’re in prison.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="tax-and-inheritance"><header><h1>Part 4: Tax and inheritance</h1>
  </header><h2>Tax</h2>
<p>Your extra State Pension counts as income and you might have to pay tax on it. </p>

<p>Your lump sum is taxed at the highest tax rate that applies to your other income. Contact your tax office if you have specific tax enquiries.</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>If your husband, wife or civil partner dies while they’re deferring then you may be entitled to inherit their extra State Pension or lump-sum. To do this both of the following must apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you were still married or in the civil partnership when they died</li>
  <li>you have not remarried or formed a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age</li>
</ul>
<p>You claim your inheritance when <a href="/state-pension/how-to-claim" title="claiming your State Pension">claiming your State Pension</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a widower or civil partner you must be over State Pension age at the time when your wife or civil partner dies. This condition does not apply to widowers and civil partners who reached State Pension age on or after 6 April 2010.</p>

<p>If you were under State Pension age when your wife or civil partner died and you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2010, you may claim up to 3 months of your late wife’s or late civil partner’s deferred State Pension.</p>
