</header><article id="what-you-may-get"><header><h1>Part 1: What you may get</h1>
  </header><p>If you defer your State Pension you may get extra money. You could get this as either extra State Pension or a lump sum payment.</p>

<h2>Extra State Pension</h2>

<p>If you put off claiming your State Pension for at least 5 weeks you may earn extra State Pension. Your State Pension will increase by 1% for every 5 weeks you put off claiming. This is the same as 10.4% for every full year you put off claiming.</p>

<p>Once you claim your State Pension, any extra State Pension you have built up will usually increase each year to take account of price inflation.</p>

<h2>Lump sum payment</h2>

<p>If you put off claiming your State Pension for at least 12 months in a row, you may choose to get a one-off lump sum payment.</p>
