</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing scholarships for your employees’ family members, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<p>This also applies to exhibitions, bursaries and other educational endowments.</p>


</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax and National Insurance if the employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year.</p>

<h2>‘Fortuitous’ scholarships</h2>

<p>You also don’t have to pay or report anything if the scholarship is ‘fortuitous’. This means that there’s no direct connection between the employee working for your business and their family member getting a scholarship. </p>

<p>A scholarship is fortuitous if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the person with the scholarship is in full-time education</li>
  <li>the scholarship would still have gone to that person even if their family member didn’t work for you</li>
  <li>the scholarship is run from a trust fund or under a scheme</li>
  <li>25% or fewer of the payments made by the fund or scheme are for employment-linked scholarships </li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the scholarship isn’t <a href="/scholarship-for-employees-family-member-reporting-expenses-and-benefits/what-is-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you must report it to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on it.</p>

<p>For employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more per year, or directors, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section M</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the cost of providing the scholarship</li>
