    <title>Working with local partners to plan for, and respond to, emergencies</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that local communities can be resilient in the event of major emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with local and national bodies to ensure they work and communicate together effectively to respond to and recover from emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="working-with-local-resilience-forums"&gt;Working with local resilience forums&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s aim is to reduce the risk from emergencies so that people can go about their business freely and with confidence, and the Cabinet Office co-ordinates the central government response. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) is responsible for the government’s work with local councils and other local services in England to plan for major emergencies. DCLG works closely with other central government departments and local resilience forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local resilience forum is a formal group made up of representatives from local public services including the police, fire and ambulance services, local councils, the NHS, the Environment Agency and other organisations that have a duty or an interest in planning for major emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCLG provides a national network of advisers who work closely with all 38 local resilience forums throughout England to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help them plan for, respond to and recover from a wide range of emergencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure that organisations effectively fulfil their roles and responsibilities set out in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/civil-contingencies-act" title="Civil Contingencies Act 2004"&gt;Civil Contingencies Act 2004&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="working-with-local-strategic-co-ordinating-groups-when-emergencies-happen"&gt;Working with local strategic co-ordinating groups when emergencies happen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some emergencies need emergency responders and local agencies to work together and in these cases a strategic co-ordinating group, chaired in most cases by a senior police officer, will be set up to oversee and co-ordinate the local response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic co-ordinating groups can ask for the help of a government representative to ensure that the government has a full understanding of the impact of the emergency and can help with any extra support or action that may help local organisations to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A response co-ordinating group may be convened where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local organisations have been, or may be, overwhelmed and support from other places is needed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an emergency affects a number of areas so it would be useful to bring together representatives from other strategic co-ordinating groups and/or organisations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="providing-strategic-support"&gt;Providing strategic support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government departments can provide strategic support for emergencies affecting their responsibilities. For any given emergency, a ‘lead government department’ usually takes overall responsibility for: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessing the situation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensuring ministers are kept up to date &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing co-ordinated policy and other support as necessary to local responders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resilience advisers work with the government departments that are responsible for dealing with specific emergencies. For example, as part of the Department for Transport and Department of Health winter preparations, resilience advisers highlight winter weather risks with local resilience forums and promote local resilience to severe weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="financial-support-for-responding-to-emergencies"&gt;Financial support for responding to emergencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities can apply for financial help from government through the Bellwin Scheme for their immediate costs of dealing with an emergency in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is usually used as a response to incidents where bad weather caused threats to life and property beyond all previous local experience. Although the law does not rule out other types of incident, DCLG expects that the scheme will continue to apply mainly to bad weather incidents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details about how the scheme works are available in the &lt;a href="link%20to%20publication"&gt;Bellwin Scheme 2012-13: guidance notes and application form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="helping-communities-recover-from-emergencies"&gt;Helping communities recover from emergencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a small number of emergencies, an event is of such a scale that the recovery process may benefit from a degree of government co-ordination and support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the government helped businesses and communities affected by the public disorder that happened in August 2011 by co-ordinating a range of support from across government for local businesses and local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="national-risk-register"&gt;National Risk Register&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see an official government assessment of risks to the UK, both from natural hazards like flooding and different types of terrorism on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/national-risk-register" title="National Risk Register"&gt;National Risk Register.&lt;/a&gt; The government has also produced &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-recovery-guidance" title="National recovery guidance"&gt;national recovery guidance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2010, the government published its national security strategy ‘&lt;a href="link%20to%20publication"&gt;A strong Britain in an age of uncertainty’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt; This describes how we need the structures in place to allow us to react quickly and effectively to new and evolving threats to our security. Government departments contribute to tasks identified in the National Security Strategy, with overall co- ordination provided by the Cabinet Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Risk Register forms part of the National Security Strategy. In January 2012 the National Risk Register was updated to inform the public about the government’s current assessment of the likelihood and potential impact of a range of different civil emergency risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Risk Register divides risks into 3 main categories: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;natural events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;major accidents &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;malicious attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It evaluates a number of risks under each of these headings, rated by relative impact and relative likelihood, and discusses the measures currently in place to deal with each of these and what individuals and organisations can do to mitigate the effects of civil disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Supporting economic development projects in coastal and seaside areas</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many seaside towns and villages have suffered decades of economic decline. Many young people, for example, have moved away from coastal areas due to a lack of job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to invest in coastal towns to help their economies grow and reduce unemployment and deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have created a Coastal Communities Fund of £23.7 million in 2012 to 2013 to help coastal towns and villages provide training and employment opportunities for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) Select Committee’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/351.pdf" title="DCLG Select Committee Report on Coastal Towns"&gt;report on coastal towns&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2007, recognised that many coastal towns shared a number of common characteristics, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;physical isolation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high deprivation levels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inward migration of older people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;large numbers of people passing through without settling &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;outward migration of young people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;poor-quality housing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2008 study by &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; similarly concluded that, taking account of a range of socio-economic indicators, the larger English seaside towns are, on average, more disadvantaged than England as a whole. It noted that there is high unemployment among seaside town residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coastal Communities Fund was first announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in July 2011. The fund prospectus, setting out the delivery arrangements for the fund and the criteria for assessing bids, was published in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working with the Big Lottery Fund, who will manage the Coastal Communities Fund through its ‘BIG Fund’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Supporting fire and rescue authorities to reduce the number and impact of fires</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities have a duty in law to promote fire safety and respond to fires and a range of other emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that fire and rescue authorities have the right resources to do their job effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with them to ensure that standards of service are consistent across the country, while also giving them the freedom to decide how best to provide services locally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provide funding to the fire authorities through the revenue support grant – an annual grant from central government for fire authorities to meet their ongoing expenses. Fire and rescue authorities, working with other organisations in their area, use this funding to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce deaths and injuries from fire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;help people to prevent fires, especially those who are most vulnerable because of old age or disability &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;respond effectively to major national emergencies like severe weather, flooding and terrorist incidents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set the overall structure of 46 fire authorities in England, and are responsible for the laws they have to work within.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We publish a national framework, which is agreed by Parliament, to explain what we expect fire and rescue authorities to achieve with the government funding they receive. The most recent &lt;a href="link%20to%20publication"&gt;Fire and rescue national framework&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt; was published in July 2012. The framework includes information about what fire and rescue authorities must do to prepare for and respond to national emergencies. However, it does not instruct fire and rescue authorities about local operational matters. We think fire and rescue authorities should work with people, businesses and other organisations to decide how to work effectively in their area.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fire-prevention"&gt;Fire prevention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have helped to reduce deaths and injuries and the overall incidence of fire by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running the &lt;a href="www.facebook.com/firekills%20%E2%80%9CFireKills%E2%80%9D"&gt;Fire Kills&lt;/a&gt; campaign – the national campaign designed to educate people about fire safety to help them prevent fires &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;commissioning &lt;a href="link%20to%20publication%20documents/fire/pdf/151012.pdf"&gt;research to identify particular groups likely to be at increased risk from fire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with the European Commission to develop a new safety standard for cigarettes so that only those that self-extinguish when not being smoked actively are available for sale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="fire-resilience-programme"&gt;Fire resilience programme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire resilience programme. We have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provided digital radios for the fire and rescue service for England, Scotland and Wales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provided specialist equipment and training for fire and rescue services to respond effectively to major emergencies and accidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;established a new Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board to provide a way for fire authorities and other organisations to plan for disasters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="fire-service-college"&gt;Fire Service College&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give the Fire Service College the flexibility to achieve commercial success, we have agreed to sell it to the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="improving-control-rooms"&gt;Improving control rooms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working with fire and rescue authorities to improve control rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire deaths in the home have halved since the 1980s. Since 2007 the number of accidental fire deaths in the home has stabilised at around 210 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, fire and rescue authorities face new challenges. They need to be able to deal with the continuing threat of terrorism, the impact of climate change, and the impacts of an ageing population, against the need to cut the national deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is against this background that we launched the revised national framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous national framework (2008 to 2011) covered a broad range of activities and responsibilities for fire and rescue authorities including planning for and responding to national emergencies, and fire prevention, protection and response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the response to the fire and rescue sector’s &lt;a href="link%20to%20publication"&gt;Fire Futures Reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;, government committed to work with fire and rescue authorities to develop and consult on a revised national framework. Our aim was to reset the relationship between central government and fire and rescue authorities to give the authorities more local control over how they operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran a public consultation on the new national framework. This led to the development of the revised framework, which was laid before Parliament in July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We launched a &lt;a href="link%20to%20publication"&gt;consultation on the future of fire and rescue control rooms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt; in January 2011. The overwhelming response to the consultation was that fire authorities wanted more freedom to decide how to provide services to meet the needs of people in their area.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public &lt;a href="link%20to%20publication"&gt;consultation on the new national framework&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt; ran from December 2011 to March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/21/contents" title="Fire and Rescue Services Act"&gt;Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/735/contents/made" title="Fire and Rescue Services (Emergencies) (England) Order 2007"&gt;Fire and Rescue Service (Emergencies)(England) Order 2007&lt;/a&gt; give fire and rescue authorities mandatory functions in relation to fire and road traffic accidents and in connection with certain types of emergencies (chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear and urban search and rescue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities are also ‘category 1 responders’ under the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents" title="Civil Contingencies Act 2004"&gt;Civil Contingencies Act 2004&lt;/a&gt;. This means they are subject to the full set of civil protection duties, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessing the risk of emergencies happening (ranging from widespread flooding to terrorist attacks) and using this to inform contingency planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensuring that emergency plans and business continuity management arrangements are in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="regulatory-reform-fire-safety-order-2005"&gt;Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" title="Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005"&gt;Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005&lt;/a&gt; replaced over 70 pieces of fire safety law. It’s designed to prevent fires in non-domestic premises and protect employees and the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve produced &lt;a href="link%20to%20publication"&gt;guidance on making your premises safe from fire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt; for those seeking advice on how to comply with the provisions of the order - usually employers or owners/occupiers of commercial buildings and those to which the public have access. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also manage the statutory determination of disputes process available under article 36 of the order. This means that if someone responsible for fire safety in a non-domestic premises disagrees with a fire inspection recommendation of how fire precautions should be technically put in place in the building, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government can decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 46 fire and rescue authorities in England of various size and structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities are responsible for providing local fire and rescue services. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promoting fire safety and enforcing fire safety regulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fire-fighting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;national resilience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;special services, like rescuing people from road traffic accidents &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also work with a number of organisations to develop fire and rescue policy, including the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.local.gov.uk/" title="Local Government Association"&gt;Local Government Association,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cfoa.org.uk/" title="Chief Fire Officers' Association"&gt;Chief Fire Officers’ Association,&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fbu.org.uk" title="Fire Brigades Union"&gt;Fire Brigades Union,&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://therfu.org" title="Retained Firefighters Union"&gt;Retained Firefighters Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.firesectorfederation.co.uk" title="Fire Sector Federation"&gt;Fire Sector Federation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;To give people more control over the development of their local area, we are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving communities the power to set the priorities for local development through &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/neighbourhood-planning" title="neighbourhood planning"&gt;neighbourhood planning&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requiring local planning authorities to draw up a clear, up to date &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/local-plans"&gt;Local Plans&lt;/a&gt; that conforms with the National Planning Policy Framework &lt;em&gt;link to Planning system policy supporting detail&lt;/em&gt; , meets local development needs and reflects local people’s views of how they wish their area to develop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving councils the power to raise money to support local infrastructure through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/community-infrastructure-levy" title="community infrastructure levy"&gt;community infrastructure levy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving councils new powers to stop unwanted development on gardens (so-called ‘garden grabbing’)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a commitment in the coalition agreement to give people more power over development in their area &lt;strong&gt;link to coalition agreement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act 2011 introduced new powers for people to make neighbourhood plans and neighbourhood planning orders, with reduced interference from central government. These new powers are in addition to existing opportunities for community involvement, which are already part of the planning system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government consulted on [proposed regulations for neighbourhood planning] &lt;strong&gt;consultation&lt;/strong&gt; between October 2011 and January 2012. 
We consulted on [proposed changes to the community infrastructure levy] &lt;strong&gt;link to: consultation&lt;/strong&gt; between October and December 2011.
We also consulted on [proposed changes to the regulations which govern the process by which local councils prepare their development plans] &lt;strong&gt;consultation&lt;/strong&gt; between July and October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neighbourhood planning provisions are contained in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted" title="Localism Act 2011"&gt;Localism Act 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/637/contents/made" title="Neighbourhood planning legislation"&gt;Neighbourhood planning legislation&lt;/a&gt; came into effect in April 2012. Further legislation covering the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://legislation.gov.uk.uksi/2012/2031/made" title="referendum stage of neighbourhood planning"&gt;referendum stage of neighbourhood planning&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 2 August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2918/contents/made" title="The Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Community Infrastructure Levy Functions) Order 2011"&gt;The Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Community Infrastructure Levy Functions) Order 2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/987/contents/made" title="Community Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) Regulations 2011"&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) Regulations 2011&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 6 April 2011.                                                                                                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Bringing people together in strong, united communities</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to achieve more integrated communities and to create the conditions for everyone to live and work successfully alongside each other. 
Integration is a vital local issue and requires a local response. Although government has an important role to play, we want local communities to identify the issues which affect their area and to shape their own response.	 
We believe that people can come together in strong, united communities if we encourage and support them to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have shared aspirations and values&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a strong sense of mutual commitments and obligations, promoting personal and social responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take part in local and national life and decision-making &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fulfil their potential to get on in life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;challenge extremism and hate crime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that action to achieve to build strong communities is usually most effective when it is led by the people it most concerns. But in a few cases government also provides funding and support for activities to demonstrate ways to promote community integration. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/bringing-people-together-in-strong-united-communities/supporting-pages/projects-to-support-strong-communities" title="Projects to support strong communities"&gt;These projects&lt;/a&gt; are in partnership with businesses, voluntary organisations and communities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tackling-extremism-and-hate-crime"&gt;Tackling extremism and hate crime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to ensuring that everyone has the freedom to live free from hostility or harassment. 
Projects aimed at tackling extremism and intolerance include working with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.annefrank.org.uk/" title="Anne Frank Trust website"&gt;Anne Frank Trust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.srtrc.org/" title="Show Racism the Red Card website"&gt;Show Racism the Red Card&lt;/a&gt; to help educate young people on the dangers of racism; work by the Searchlight Educational Trust to build local communities’ resilience to extremist far right narratives and support to Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks (&lt;abbr title="Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks (MAMA)"&gt;MAMA&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="promoting-faith-and-the-freedom-to-pray"&gt;Promoting faith and the freedom to pray&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith communities are involved in a huge range of activities and projects to improve communities, and we are providing them support to promote and celebrate their faith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have given all major local councils in England a ‘general power of competence’. This should give them the freedom to include prayers as part of the formal meetings, if they wish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="helping-adults-with-english-language-skills"&gt;Helping adults with English language skills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re providing funding to support English language provision for those adults who are not in employment or are actively seeking employment and are unable to afford the cost of language classes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="reducing-inequalities-faced-by-the-gypsy-and-traveller-community"&gt;Reducing inequalities faced by the Gypsy and Traveller community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set up a dedicated ministerial group in November 2011 to coordinate action across government to help improve the life chances of Gypsies and Traveller communities. In April 2012, the group published a progress report that includes 28 commitments from across government that will help service providers to work more effectively with these communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="future-actions"&gt;Future actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promoting understanding of British life and values
We are looking at how the settlement and citizenship process and ‘Life in the UK Test’ can better promote an understanding not just of English language, but also of British life and of the values and principles which underlie British society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="support-ethnic-minority-entrepreneurs"&gt;Support ethnic minority entrepreneurs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at what more could be done to support ethnic minority entrepreneurs, including examining any barriers to black and ethnic minority groups accessing business finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; published &lt;a href="#"&gt;Creating the conditions for integration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;in February 2012. This set out our approach to creating integrated communities, which is achieved in part through promoting social mobility and equality of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="social-mobility"&gt;Social mobility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2011, the government published its &lt;a href="#"&gt;social mobility strategy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;
In May 2012, we published an &lt;a href="#"&gt;update on the social mobility strategy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="equality"&gt;Equality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2010, the government published its &lt;a href="#"&gt;equality strategy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;
On 22 May 2012, we published a &lt;a href="#"&gt;progress report on the equality strategy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt;. This describes how the new approach to equality is beginning to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Creating the conditions for integration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/strong&gt; sets out our views on what is important to promote integrated communities, but does not represent the end of the process. We will continue to discuss our approach with partners and help them to take action in response to the issues raised in the document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted" title="Localism Act 2011 on www.legislation.gov.uk"&gt;Localism Act 2011&lt;/a&gt;  introduces new rights for communities to take greater control in their local areas.

    <title>Providing effective building regulations so that new and altered buildings are safe, accessible and efficient</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building Regulations contain the rules for new and altered buildings to make them safe and accessible and limit waste and environmental damage. People carrying out building work must usually arrange for their work to be checked by an independent third party to make sure that their work meets the required standards. In some cases the installer can certify themselves that their work complies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building practices, technology and construction techniques are constantly evolving. We need to make sure that building regulations are fair, efficient, up to date and effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government (DGLC) is &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-effective-building-regulations-so-that-new-and-altered-buildings-are-safe-accessible-and-efficient/supporting-pages/review-of-building-regulations" title="Review of Building Regulations"&gt;reviewing Building Regulations in England&lt;/a&gt; to make sure they continue to be up to date and effective.
&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; also carries out many ongoing actions to provide effective Building Regulations. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publishing guidance that builders must comply with called &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-effective-building-regulations-so-that-new-and-altered-buildings-are-safe-accessible-and-efficient/supporting-pages/approved-documents" title="Approved Documents"&gt;Approved Documents&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;authorising [competent person self-certification schemes]&lt;strong&gt;mainstream/business guide or to the BCS supporting page below&lt;/strong&gt;
producing [circulars]&lt;strong&gt;specialist section listing all the BR circulars&lt;/strong&gt; and [divisional circular letters]&lt;strong&gt;specialist section listing all the BR divisional circular letters&lt;/strong&gt; to formally tell interested parties about changes to Building Regulations policy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="Publications%20series%20on%20Building%20Regs%20research%20reports"&gt;publishing research&lt;/a&gt; to provide a scientific basis to underpin the regulations   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adjudicating in disputes between people carrying out building work and a building control body through processes called &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-effective-building-regulations-so-that-new-and-altered-buildings-are-safe-accessible-and-efficient/supporting-pages/determinations-and-appeals" title="Determinations and appeals"&gt;determinations and appeals&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first set of national building standards were introduced with The Building Regulations 1965. These were a set of prescriptive standards that had to be followed.
The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55" title="The Building Act - Legislation website"&gt;Building Act 1984&lt;/a&gt; brought fundamental changes to the Building Regulations regime. It introduced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functional performance standards, set in terms of what was ad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;equate, reasonable or appropriate, supported by statutory guidance in the Approved Documents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;competition into the building control sector through the addition of private sector approved inspectors &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes were introduced to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the standards more flexible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make the system more efficient and effective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, there have been further changes to the legislation and the supporting guidance. These have sought to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve the overall quality of buildings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve the effectiveness of the Building Regulations system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduce any unnecessary burdens on those who use the system &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Giving people more power over what happens in their neighbourhood</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long communities have not had a big enough say in what happens in their local area – whether it be about what happens to local amenities, how local services are delivered or how new development is planned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) is taking action to give local communities new rights. These rights will give community, voluntary and charity groups the opportunity to take the initiative when it comes to how local public services are run and planning decisions are made. 
We are offering support to groups who want to use these new rights – providing information, guidance and funding to help them navigate and exercise the rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-right-to-bid"&gt;Community Right to Bid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/community-right-to-bid" title="Community Right to Bid"&gt;Community Right to Bid&lt;/a&gt; will give community groups  the right to prepare and bid to buy community buildings and facilities that are important to them. It’s expected to come into effect in Autumn 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-right-to-challenge"&gt;Community Right to Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/community-right-to-challenge" title="Community Right to Challenge"&gt;Community Right to Challenge&lt;/a&gt; allows voluntary and community groups, charities, parish councils and local authority staff to bid to run a local authority service where they believe they can do so differently and better. This may be the whole service or part of a service. It came into force on 27 June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="neighbourhood-planning"&gt;Neighbourhood planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/neighbourhood-planning" title="Neighbourhood planning"&gt;neighbourhood planning&lt;/a&gt; measures allow communities to shape new development by coming together to prepare neighbourhood plans. They came into force on 6 April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-right-to-build"&gt;Community Right to Build&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/community-right-to-build" title="Community Right to Build"&gt;Community Right to Build&lt;/a&gt; allows local communities to propose small-scale, site-specific, community-led developments. It came into force on 6 April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-right-to-reclaim-land"&gt;Community Right to Reclaim Land&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/community-right-to-reclaim-land" title="Community Right to Reclaim Land"&gt;Community Right to Reclaim Land&lt;/a&gt; helps communities to improve their local area by giving them the right to ask that under-used or unused land owned by public bodies is brought back into beneficial use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="design-support-for-communities"&gt;Design support for communities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re supporting an industry-led review to help in putting together a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/design-support-for-communities" title="Design support for communities"&gt;cross-sector package of design support for communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Making the planning system work more efficiently and effectively </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes planning decisions can take too long. This can slow down or prevent people building new homes, creating new places and bringing disused or neglected land and buildings back into productive use. 
We need to ensure that the planning rules or poorly managed planning processes do not unnecessarily prevent or delay development. We want to simplify planning approval processes and make our policies and guidance simpler and easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To speed up the planning approval process, the Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provided a National Planning Policy Framework, the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively/supporting-pages/national-planning-casework-unit" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;government’s view of what sustainable development means in practice&lt;/a&gt; for the planning system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced, or is introducing, a range of other measures to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively/supporting-pages/speeding-up-the-planning-process" title="Speeding up planning decisions"&gt;speed up planning decisions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To speed up planning for nationally significant infrastructure projects (such as wind farms or motorways) we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are reforming the infrastructure planning process to  make sure it remains efficient &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;want to extend the scope of the major infrastructure planning system to include new categories of commercial and business development so that, where they’re of sufficient significance, they can be determined at a national level
&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; also carries out many ongoing actions to ensure that the planning system stays effective and up to date  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make decisions about planning casework, compulsory purchase orders and land transaction cases through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively/supporting-pages/national-planning-policy-framework" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Casework Unit&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;abolished the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 1 April 2012, so that decisions on national infrastructure proposals are now made by ministers advised by the Planning Inspectorate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can &lt;a href="/supporting-pages/called-in-planning-decisions-and-appeals" title="Called-in planning decisions and appeals"&gt;‘call-in’ planning decisions and appeals&lt;/a&gt; to be decided by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oversee and support local planning authorities’ plan-making and decision-taking functions, mainly by providing planning laws, national planning policy and guidance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Agreement set out the government’s commitment to publish and present to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning framework covering all forms of development and setting out national economic, environmental and social priorities by April 2012. On 27 March 2012 the National Planning Policy Framework (the ‘Framework’) was published. 
The Framework was produced following an extensive consultation with Parliament and the public.
The final Framework retains all of the most important elements of the draft Framework published in July 2011, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making sure the local plan - produced by communities - is the keystone of the planning system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making planning much simpler and more accessible, reducing over 1,000 pages of often impenetrable jargon into around 50 pages of clearly written guidance &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;establishing a presumption in favour of sustainable development that means that development is not held up unless to approve it would be against our collective interest &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;guaranteeing strong protections for the natural and historic environment, and requiring improvements to put right some of the neglect that has taken place &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;raising the bar on design standards so that the requirements for design are the most exacting yet &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve consulted on various aspects of planning reform, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing planning obligations to be renegotiated &lt;a href="#"&gt;Renegotiation of Section 106 planning obligations consultation&lt;/a&gt;ADD LINK to help get stalled development projects back on track&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating new opportunities to reuse existing buildings for sustainable development &lt;a href="#"&gt;New opportunities for sustainable development and growth through the reuse of existing buildings consultation&lt;/a&gt;ADD LINK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#"&gt;simplifying information requirements for planning applications&lt;/a&gt;ADD LINK link to Streamlining information requirements for planning applications consultation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted" title="Localism Act"&gt;Localism Act 2011&lt;/a&gt; introduced a number of changes to the planning system, including transferring decisions on major infrastructure projects from the Infrastructure Planning Commission to ministers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further changes to the &lt;a href="http://legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/29/contents%20to%20improve%20the%20infrastructure%20planning%20process"&gt;Planning Act 2008&lt;/a&gt; will be introduced  &lt;strong&gt;XXXX poss Thursday 18 Oct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-we-are-working-with"&gt;Who we are working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local planning authorities prepare development plans, based on consultation with local communities, which set out their overall plans for development in their area. 
Local planning authorities are also responsible for development management. This includes making planning decisions, complying with the law about publicising, consulting on and determining most applications for planning permission, taking into account the opinions of local people and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also offer pre-application advice to prospective developers and enforce planning laws in their area. 
Appeals against refusal of planning permission and inquiries are dealt with by the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate" title="Planning Inspectorate"&gt;Planning Inspectorate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/" title="The Planning Portal"&gt;Planning Portal&lt;/a&gt; includes advice on planning permission, online applications and guidance on how the system works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information on planning for major infrastructure projects can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk"&gt;Planning Inspectorate website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
