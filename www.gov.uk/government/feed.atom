    <title>Making HS2 happen</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Introduced by Professor David Begg, Publisher of Transport Times.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that kind introduction David… it’s a pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many thanks to you… and to everybody at Transport Times and the Railway Industry Association… for organising this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of too many people or organisations that could have got a conference like this up and running… or brought together an audience as expert and distinguished as this… at such a short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My congratulations for delivering it on time, presumably on budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="consultation"&gt;Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement I made a fortnight ago was the culmination of a vast programme of work over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/high-speed-rail/consultation/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; consultation&lt;/a&gt; was one of the largest in the Department for Transport’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had five months of intensive engagement. 41 days of roadshow attended by almost 33,000 people. And almost 55,000 consultation responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And systematically going through the evidence and the alternatives, it was clear to me that the argument in favour of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/high-speed-rail/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern,fast reliable, railway that will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transform connections between our cities, regions and the Continent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;truly rebalance our economic geography, with a legacy of jobs, growth and opportunity for generations to come&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and change the way we travel, just as the first railway did in the 19th century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But behind the headline statistics, &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is also about believing in better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we believe in just making do. Is that all we have to offer our future generations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government passionately believes they deserve so much more. In the same way that we are not prepared to leave them with a fiscal deficit, neither should we leave them with an infrastructure deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the children and students I meet at my local primary and secondary school - what kind of a Britain do we want to create for them? And, how can we make sure our country will be able to match their ambition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long in this country, we have failed to grasp the nettle on the decisions that will help us achieve our long term aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t simply hope for a better, more prosperous future - we will have to build it. We won’t suddenly wake up to a successful Britain, we have to create it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to live in a country that can compete and thrive in the global economy, and where our children can realise their full potential, then we have to tackle the problems that are holding us back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is all about…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about understanding that we have a responsibility to make choices today that will improve our economy and people’s quality of life, not just in the next four or five years, but in the next four or five decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="restating-the-case"&gt;Restating the case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are some people who question the size of our ambitions. Who say that Britain cannot support such a scheme in such austere times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well today I’d like to reassure them that this is the right scheme at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to do that, I think I need to clear up some of the claims about &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; that I’ve read in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commentators have said we are spending £32bn building a new line between London and Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I have good news for them. £32bn will buy us a national high speed network, linking London and Birmingham with Leeds, Manchester, South Yorkshire and the East Midlands - and forming the base of what we hope is an even bigger network extending to Scotland in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have focused purely on &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;’s time savings - claiming the investment is poor value just to shave a few minutes off today’s journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will certainly reduce journey times. In fact it will slash the trip from Birmingham to Leeds in half, and cut the Manchester to London time from 2hrs 8mins today to just 1hr 8mins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are dramatic time savings that will offer a step change in services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valuable as faster journeys are - and passengers tell us that the time factor is very important to them - more crucial is the substantial capacity boost that &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will deliver, reducing the increasingly overwhelming pressure on existing road and rail networks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rail network that will simply end up full in many places. If we don’t take action, people say put more trains on the track, have more carriages on the trains on the track, well that’s what we’ve been doing! There’s no other way we would have lasted on a Victorian railway network otherwise. But common sense tells you that can’t go on forever. And after 110 years we’ve nearly got to the end of forever. On some of our tracks there is simply isn’t going to be any more space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so we need MORE track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But high speed rail will provide up to 18 high speed trains per hour, each with up to 1000 seats… more room on the current railway as well… greater reliability; better performance; and more comfortable long distance travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without investment in new capacity, our main rail arteries will grind to a halt during the 2020s, with disruption, overcrowding, and damage to our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With demand for long-distance rail doubling over the past 15 years, inter-city trains are already becoming overcrowded, and commuters who may have no practical alternative to train travel are forced to stand on long journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unreliable, congested, transport would send out a message to investors that Britain doesn’t really care about its infrastructure… or that we are incapable of delivering major projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a modern, developed economy, that’s not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to continue to ignore the problem is no more an option that pretending our A-road system would have managed without the motorways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we are doing what we can to modernise our current railway with £18bn of investment committed in the Spending Review, and pressing ahead with our plans to max out the capacity on the current track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even with that investment, the scope for squeezing out ever-more out of our ageing rail infrastructure is diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is simply not good enough to criticise schemes like &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; unless there is a practical alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those alternatives that have been proposed have fallen short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading existing major north-south lines would only provide a short term fix, and would consign passengers to years of disruption, delays and misery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And high speed offers much better value than a new conventional north-south rail line - delivering £6.2bn more in benefits for an extra investment of just £1.4bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So high speed will give an additional return on the investment of more than four to one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the evidence has been considered. And we are clear that the only long term solution to the capacity crunch we face on our railways is high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think the capacity crunch will somehow naturally melt away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One commentator claimed that high speed rail would soon be obsolete, because the advance in computers will mean that more people work from home. And rather than speed up, he actually suggested we ought to find ways to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I don’t share his analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen mobile and Internet connectivity through technology transform in the past 15 years - and people have never travelled by train more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will not get people back to work and secure economic recovery by putting a brake on progress, and telling passengers they have got to put up with slower journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that the world is moving ever faster. Technology is always developing. And we have to prepare for a faster future if we want Britain to prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who wants slower broadband? Who would choose to have a slow train journey rather than a fast one? And how can businesses hope to compete if they cannot transport goods around the country quickly and efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern manufacturers and retailers rely on just-in-time distribution to maintain profitability. Slowing down transport would merely act as a further barrier to investment, and as a drain on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is about the nuts and bolts of Britain, and making our infrastructure work for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In country after country around the world, high speed rail has proved to be hugely popular with a wide market. Countries that have it invariably build more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, high speed rail is a success around the world because it has a mass market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will benefit every type of traveller - not just on the new network, but on existing lines too. More space and capacity freed up will help drive competition on the railway, changing the way rail travel is marketed and sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do though, of course, accept that there is no easy way to build a train line through our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand and respect the concerns of people living or working near the line and we have gone to very great lengths to mitigate its impact - including a package of extra alterations announced on January 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 13 miles through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, less than 2 miles will be at or above the surface… the rest will be in deep cutting or tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes will bring significant benefits to communities and the environment; and, in fact, compared to the consultation route there will be a more than 50 per cent increase in tunnel or green tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I welcome the comments of Shaun Spiers, Chief Executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, who said the government had been sensitive to the impact that &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; would have on communities and the countryside; and that their legitimate concerns about the effects of high speed on the landscape had been heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will do my level best to work closely with communities as the High Speed project progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="industry-opportunities"&gt;Industry opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course there is another very key benefit of high speed that has not been reflected in much of the coverage over the past two weeks: the opportunities and jobs it will it provide for the rail industry in Britain; the jobs it will create for your companies and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For engineering and technology companies; rail operators; suppliers and component manufacturers; for infrastructure specialists; and many, many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All stand to gain as we write a new chapter in the story of rail innovation in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will present this industry with a massive challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering a major national programme on time and on budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we can meet that challenge and I believe we can develop expertise so British companies can compete successfully for key contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s National Infrastructure Plan sets out the importance of a predictable and transparent long-term pipeline of infrastructure projects that will help the private sector plan ahead and invest in technology and skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will form a key element of that long-term pipeline, providing certainty about future contracting opportunities following the completion of Crossrail in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the UK-based supply chain is in a position to benefit as far as possible from this project, this government will open a dialogue with potential UK-based suppliers to ensure they are well-placed to bid competitively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are already helping us deliver Crossrail, Thameslink, upgrades to major rail hubs like Reading and Birmingham New Street, and a major programme of electrification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also want to put our best minds to work on high speed rail. To find uniquely British solutions to the challenges we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want Britain to become a centre of excellence for high speed rail technologies and services, with a world-class R&amp;amp;D capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we may collaborate with companies from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from the very start our priority must be to develop the home-grown skills and capabilities that will not only help deliver &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; - but that can then be used in other markets as high speed rail is increasingly adopted by countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to reject the short termism of the past, and get our long term future back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence from around the world is clear: as a fast, sustainable and viable way of long-distance, mass transport, high speed rail has no modern equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the right transport programme for passengers; for freight; and for rebalancing our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the incredible enthusiasm for &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; across our great cities. Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, these cities know the transformational value high speed rail will have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They rightly believe that the future success of their regions and their communities depends on schemes like this - which will create opportunities on their doorstep. I will work hand-in-hand with them to make sure the jobs and the growth that we all hope for, actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know most of us here today are convinced of the case for high speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are many who perfectly understandably will want to continue the debate. I welcome the opportunity to set out our case. Because it is strong and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is also important those who understand the benefits of &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; continue to make their voices heard, and continue to highlight the transformational impact it will have on our railway and on our economy. Now more than ever our case needs to be made positively, clearly and fully informed by the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will prepare for a hybrid bill by the end of 2013, including a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment to provide the necessary powers to construct and operate the line from London to Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring we will consult on the draft directions for safeguarding the proposed route from London to the West Midlands, as well as separately consulting on detailed compensation proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hs2.org.uk/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd&lt;/a&gt; will advise me on route and station options to Manchester, Leeds and Heathrow, and later in 2012 we will start informal consultation on a preferred route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, these plans will set in motion the most important transport project in this country since the coming of the motorways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I warmly welcome the political consensus on &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;, on the basis that it will help ensure that the planning and construction of this transformational scheme is carried through to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly exciting time for everyone who cares about Britain’s railway and preserving its critical role supporting our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the benefits of &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will be felt well beyond the network and the passengers who use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a national scheme in the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about raising our sights. Future-proofing Britain’s railway so we don’t wake up in 20 years’ time with a gridlocked railway regretting that we hadn’t been bolder today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remembering that Britain can no more turn its back on the positive potential of high-speed rail than it could have opted out of the steam age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will build high speed two. We will make sure our country and our cities are connected for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will have in place the railway capacity that our future generations need for their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They need our plans put into action more than any of us here today and this government will not let them down.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport annual dinner</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you Matthew for that introduction (Matthew Lugg - &lt;abbr title="Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport"&gt;ADEPT&lt;/abbr&gt; President).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for inviting me along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport"&gt;ADEPT&lt;/abbr&gt; and its members don’t just help to shape the transport debate in this country - you also help to set the transport agenda, so it’s a real pleasure to be with you this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are two important lessons I’ve learned since going into politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that the words, “I wish the Minister had gone on longer…” are rarely on the lips of an audience at the end of a speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the second is that you don’t win applause, or for that matter any votes, by keeping people from their well-earned dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with both of those lessons in mind, I promise to keep my speech brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="good-transport-equals-good-economics"&gt;Good transport equals good economics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am honoured and proud to be the Transport Secretary, just as I was honoured and proud to serve as a Treasury Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in each of these roles, I have come to understand the crucial importance of a certain equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as equations go, it’s a pretty straightforward one. But it drives my policy approach at the DfT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equation I’m talking about is this: good transport equals good economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cutting commuting times and speeding up journey times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving people and products faster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;connecting our businesses and wealth creators with the global economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how you generate growth and put people back to work. That’s how you make Britain’s competitive edge razor sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plain truth is that we cannot afford to sit back and look on while other countries invest in world class transport networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, In the Middle East and Africa, and even in the United States and the European Union, nation after nation is upgrading and expanding their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are our competition in the international marketplace, in the race to win the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bridge they repair and every road they improve, every rail track they lay and every global gateway they open drives their growth and increases their prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if Britain is to out-produce, out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world, then we too must update our transport infrastructure and make it fit for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s precisely what this government is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-different-choice"&gt;A different choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that ageing, past their best transport links are a tax on British businesses and British families. They cost them time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why we made a different choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking the axe to capital investment, as previous governments did when the fiscal going got tough, we looked long-term and chose to invest in transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take last year’s ‘Spending review’ - over £30 billion for road, rail and local transport across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set up the £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund - a fund to give local communities more power to design and deliver local transport schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put in place a Growing Places Fund - half a billion pounds worth of support to help kick-start infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, a multi-billion pound investment package in which transport took centre-stage - everything from electrifying more of our rail network, to easing congestion on our motorways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hs2-decision"&gt;HS2 decision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government made a different choice about transport investment because we were looking well beyond the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking decisions to improve our national well-being, not just for the next four or five years, but for the next four or five decades. And not in spite of the economic challenges we face, but as a means to overcome them. And it’s that same long-term national interest which motivated my recent decision to give the go-ahead to HS2 - a national high speed rail network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS2 will slash journey times, shrink our country and radically improve the connections between our cities and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help to create jobs and generate growth, promote social mobility and spread prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I am absolutely convinced that pushing this project over the finishing line is the right thing to do for our country’s success and our children’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="local-matters"&gt;Local matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the big-ticket national projects that can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving our quality of life and enhancing our economic prospects also means investing in transport at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all journeys start, or end, on local transport networks. And those journeys can shape your entire day, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only takes a late bus, a packed train or a congested road and a short commute becomes an endurance test and a good day turns into a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as the members of &lt;abbr title="Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport"&gt;ADEPT&lt;/abbr&gt; know better than anyone, local matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, because it matters so much, not only did we announce 20 local transport schemes in the ‘Autumn statement’, just before Christmas I gave the green light for a further 21 local major transport schemes. That’s an investment package worth £854 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="smart-localism"&gt;Smart localism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernising local transport networks, getting the very best out of them, isn’t simply about putting in the resources, as crucial as that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about devolving power - giving local people a real say over the transport services and issues that affect their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s what I call smart localism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart because it recognises that a one size fits all approach cannot work in the modern, consumer focused world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart because it enables local services, like transport, to be tailored to local needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me walk you through just a few of the ways we’re making smart localism an everyday reality. We’ve simplified funding, cutting the number of separate local transport grant streams from 26 to just four and transferring some funding into formula grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the end result of this radical reform? Local communities will have greater flexibility and freedom to decide their own priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are cutting red tape and ending pointless top-down bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One practical example: after the biggest review into Britain’s traffic signing system for forty years we published a new framework that will free up local councils to remove expensive and unsightly clutter from our roads - a reform that will save money and improve the local environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at ways to devolve more responsibility for commissioning local and regional rail services - a move that could increase transparency, strengthen accountability and, by doing so, improve the passenger experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are also committed to implementing a more devolved system for local major schemes beyond 2015 - enabling local communities and businesses to take real decisions about the transport improvements in their areas; constructing a system that’s much more responsive to local economic conditions and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with greater devolution must follow greater local accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example making sure new schemes achieve genuine value for money. We are ready to work with individual transport bodies to put in place a system that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to publish a paper soon and invite views on early proposals for a new system and I look forward to seeing your response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks---productive-partnership"&gt;Concluding remarks - productive partnership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment, reform, localism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all important ways of transforming our country’s prospects by transforming its transport system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so is productive partnership - government and stakeholders coming together and working together, pulling in the same direction to bring about real and positive change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pleased to say that partnerships don’t come more productive than the one between my department and this association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s helping us improve winter resilience in the transport sector; leading work streams in the Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme; or assisting us to review future options for the Integrated Transport Block allocation, &lt;abbr title="Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport"&gt;ADEPT&lt;/abbr&gt; and its members have shown that they are sector leaders as well as productive partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before I conclude, and more importantly, fulfil my pledge not to keep you from dinner for too long, there’s one final thing I’d like to do - and that’s pay tribute to the work you do and the difference you make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, you have been at the forefront of the transport debate, both as the County Surveyors’ Society, and more recently, as &lt;abbr title="Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport"&gt;ADEPT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, you have played a vital role in managing and maintaining our infrastructure, and strengthening the links between transport and other drivers of sustainable growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, you are helping to shape the agenda on many key areas of government policy - including planning, waste management, housing, and climate change, as well as transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is precisely because these issues are all closely connected that makes your work so valuable, and your contribution so appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening and I look forward to taking some questions&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Olympic travel event</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for that introduction Jo (Baroness Jo Valentine, Chief Exec London First), I’m delighted to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the clock ticking, and the 2012 Opening Ceremony edging ever closer, this is an important event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a big thank-you to London First, to TfL and to everyone who’s helped organise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="getting-the-transport-right"&gt;Getting the transport right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond doubt the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games will give sport in this country a once in a generation boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will be our nation’s global shop window, our golden opportunity to showcase the best of Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we simply have to make them a success - make them the very best they can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But delivering success in 2012 isn’t just about fantastic venues or British athletes winning medals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about getting the transport right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I say that, not just because I am the Transport Secretary, but because I am also a London MP and, like so many of us here today, I depend on the tubes, trains and roads that serve and support our capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like my constituents - and just like millions of others - the commuters; the mums and dads taking their kids to school; the people going shopping or just visiting friends and family, London’s transport networks are part and parcel of my working and personal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that the journey to work and the journey home again can shape your entire day, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that, at times, the daily commute can be pretty long and stressful as it is, before the additional pressures the Olympics will bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my message to you is this - I get it. I know just how much transport will matter in 2012 - for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-city-open-for-business"&gt;A city open for business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s precisely because of this that we’ve invested some £6.5 billion in upgrading and extending transport links, to increase capacity, enhance resilience and improve services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ambitious modernisation programme is already providing an impressive transport legacy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the upgraded North London line - with new, higher frequency, more reliable trains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the extension of the East London line and the DLR to Woolwich and to Stratford International&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the high speed Javelin service from St Pancras to Stratford Station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and new and improved walking and cycling routes to the Olympic Park, and to other venues, inside and outside London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these transport projects, and more, will still be delivering benefits years into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they also mean that London will be ready and able to be a world-class host next summer - a city that’s open for business in a country that’s open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="planning-ahead"&gt;Planning ahead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do understand the scale of that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without any question we face a big test. Indeed the proof is there in the transport heat-maps that TfL are publishing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the investment and the improvements, the stress and strain placed on our transport system will be unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily, up to 800,000 spectators and 55,000 athletes, officials, organisers and members of the media will be travelling to and from the Olympic venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while, on an average London workday 24 million trips take place, on the busiest Games’ day an extra 3 million trips could be added to that total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean in practical terms for companies, for employers and for the travelling public, Londoners going about their business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it means that at various times on key transport routes there are going to be a lot more people travelling… which, in turn, means there will be transport pinch points and travel hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it doesn’t mean is that London will grind to a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I acknowledge that, come the Games, we will have to think about how we can work differently and travel differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, equally, I believe that if we all plan ahead, then we will keep London and the rest of Britain moving next summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I am already struck by just how much planning is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was over with Peter (Hendy) last week, looking at how TfL are using new techniques to manage traffic on the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will have monitoring on a scale never seen before - really sophisticated models of where queues are likely to arise and how to get traffic flowing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to a transport legacy for London, I think this understanding of how to cope with so many extra visitors is a really big deal - something that will have benefits for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we should also take advantage of the other opportunities that could arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some firms may want to use the Games as an opportunity to think about how and when they get their deliveries or despatch their goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other businesses might see this as an ideal chance to make much more use of communications technologies like video and tele-conferencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some organisations could grab the opportunity to trial new ways of working - whether it’s their staff working from home on some days, or coming in at more flexible times on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those individuals travelling for work or for leisure, the period during the Games could be their chance to try a different route, stagger their journey time or work more flexibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who live near work, or travel short distances within central London, it could even be the excuse they need to cycle or walk part of their journey, or maybe even all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="giving-a-lead-working-in-partnership"&gt;Giving a lead, working in partnership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt, planning ahead can therefore help you meet the 2012 transport challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it can also help you to adapt and evolve and, in doing so, make the most of the very real opportunities the Games will bring to London, its people and its businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what our transport strategy, and this event, are all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure you have the information and tools, the advice and the options you need to get from A to B, to run your businesses and to do your jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, government has to give a lead and set an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my department recently ran a trial to reduce its travel footprint, during which people managed to positively change 69 percent of their commuting and business travel, while still getting their work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pleased to say that, next February, departments right across Whitehall will be following suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Games themselves the DfT is committed to shrinking our travel footprint by half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working right now with staff to make sure we achieve that by changing our commuting, business and visitor travel, as well as our deliveries and collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as I say, it’s right that we do these things. Because, we don’t simply have a responsibility to work and communicate with key players like those of you here today, we must also play our part to lessen demand, ease overcrowding and minimise disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But partnership matters too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s vital that we all work together to meet the 2012 transport challenge… central government and local government, the Mayor and TfL, LOCOG and the ODA, the business community and transport providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us doing our bit - 100 percent committed to keeping this city running and thriving during the Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am certainly going to do what I can - getting the message across, working alongside businesses and taking the decisions that will keep London and Londoners moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, rather than having an M4 Games lane that nobody else can use for the entire Olympics, the decision I’ve taken is that we will have a flexible lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s needed for Games family traffic, it will be used for that, and shared with buses, taxis and coaches. But when it’s not needed, we’ll switch it off and it will be open to the whole public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else I’ll be doing is to encourage other MPs in the capital to make sure their constituencies are ready for the challenge that awaits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using their local knowledge and their local networks, MPs are uniquely placed to inform and advise their local communities and employers about what they can expect and what they can do to make things run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Peter and I will be holding a comprehensive briefing for MPs after Parliament returns from the holidays, making sure the wealth of information and advice that is being prepared gets to the people who need to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at next year’s Games through the prism of transport and it soon becomes clear that the challenge we face is real and it is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am convinced it’s a challenge that can be met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test we face is tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, with planning, preparation and partnership we can keep our Capital and our country moving; we can stage a Games to remember; and we can do Britain proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rail Delivery Group Industry Forum</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for inviting me along today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of you are key players in a key industry and so I’m delighted to have a chance to make my own small contribution to this important event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do need to make an apology though. And that’s because other government commitments mean I can’t stay as long as I’d like to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m pleased to say that my colleague, the Minister of State for Rail Theresa Villiers, is also here today to answer your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="investing-in-rail-is-good-economics"&gt;Investing in rail is good economics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear to me in my job at the Treasury, and it’s even clearer to me as Transport Secretary - investing in rail is good economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting commuting times and speeding up journey times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving people and products faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting our communities and supporting our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how we can create jobs, generate growth and help Britain out-compete and out-produce the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And “investing in rail” is exactly what this government is doing with  £18 billion of rail funding in last year’s ‘Spending review’ and the biggest programme of railway modernisation since the Victorian era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a government, we recognise that each investment, each modernisation can have a tremendous ripple effect, whether it’s less congestion and more capacity, or fewer delays and greater reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, focusing resources on our railways, renewing and re-building our infrastructure - these things make a positive difference to services and to passengers, to our economy and our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the rail reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="change-and-reform-for-a-purpose"&gt;Change and reform for a purpose&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is another inescapable rail reality. And it’s one that I know you all recognise: investment must be accompanied by change and modernisation must go hand-in-hand with reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about change and reform for their own sake, but change and reform for a purpose - ensuring our railways are efficient and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in a Europe where our neighbours are competitors as well as partners, there are many areas where I want Britain to be number one, ahead of the pack and top of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the most expensive railway is definitely not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as Sir Roy McNulty concluded, that’s exactly the position our railways are in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will know, even after allowing for unavoidable differences, Sir Roy estimates that UK rail costs are 20 to 30% higher than they should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little wonder that he found significant scope in our railway system to eliminate waste and cut costs. Potential savings of up to £1 billion a year could be found by the end of this decade-. and all without any reductions in services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are some other facts that should make us all sit up and take notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1996-97 passenger numbers have risen by around 57%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background you’d expect unit costs to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, today, they remain almost exactly the same in real terms as they were in 1996-97.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, as a former chartered accountant, let alone as Transport Secretary, that just doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="efficient-and-affordable-equals-successful-and-sustainable"&gt;Efficient and affordable equals successful and sustainable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long the railway has relied on ever-increasing public subsidies on one hand and ever rising rail fares on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that means we face a choice on this… two very different options which would lead to two very different futures for the rail industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option one is that we deliver value for money for taxpayers and fare-payers… that we drive down costs and drive up efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option two is that we do nothing and stick with a status quo of expensive to build, expensive to run and expensive to maintain railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a stark choice. But it’s an easy choice because the “do-nothing option” is actually no option at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is straightforward and undeniable: the rail industry will only be able to compete for future investment if its long-term cost issues are addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s be frank, if you don’t cut costs then, eventually, your only alternatives are to cut services, hike fares even higher or do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was ever a business model designed to condemn the industry to short-term stagnation at best, and long-term decline at worst, then it is definitely this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our only option, our only course of action, is to deliver better value for money on our railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without question such an approach will boost the business prospects of this vital national industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will improve the travelling experience of rail users too, by releasing resources that can be re-invested in services and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could even mean an end to inflation-busting rises in regulated fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, for me, it’s a very straightforward rail equation -.efficient and affordable equals successful and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-must-play-its-part"&gt;Government must play its part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the challenge we face - costs down, efficiency up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And government must play our full part in meeting that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are constructing a supportive policy framework, hence our reforms of rail franchising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By introducing longer, less prescriptive franchises, we want to give the industry more freedom to innovate, as well as a stronger incentive to invest in better services and address passenger needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also bringing the days of Whitehall micro-management to an end, devolving more responsibility for managing the railways to local levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change and reform must always work for and make sense to the people and businesses that use and depend on rail, whether it’s commuters or freight customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the government wants to help fare-payers by moving towards a simpler, fairer and much more user friendly system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why we recognise the importance of increasing transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail customers must be able to benchmark performance and taxpayers must be able to see how their money is spent and what their subsidy is buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potentially greater transparency could result in greater feedback for the industry, helping the industry to really know their customers, to understand what they want from rail services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also determined to build on the value for money work carried out by Sir Roy McNulty… which means setting out our wider vision for a sustainable and successful railway, including reform of Network Rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, last week, I announced my intention to publish a command paper early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done so because, as a new Transport Secretary, I am determined to give this the focus and attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing our command paper early next year will therefore give me time to consider all the key issues around rail reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also enable me to look at what emerges from the government’s growth review, a landmark review that I am certain will shape the future of our economy and vital transport infrastructure like rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, equally as important, it will mean the command paper can properly reflect the consequences of my decision following our consultation on a national high speed rail network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the command paper I also plan to consult on the scope to devolve responsibility for some rail passenger services in parts of England to sub-national bodies, and on issues relating to the review of fares and ticketing announced in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ORR expects to consult later this year on possible changes to its role, particularly in respect of future franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accept there are some who were keen for every last dot and comma of our reform proposals to be written, ready and published this side of the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I want you to know that the decision to publish the command paper early next year is not one that I have taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rail reform matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my priority is to get our proposals right, not rush them through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="industry-leadership"&gt;Industry leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If government must play its part in meeting the big challenges facing our railways, then so too must the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pleased to say that this group, and this event, demonstrate the industry’s willingness to step up to the plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your leadership counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decisions you make and the actions you take - they can all have a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And government wants to help and support you as you meet the challenges and make the changes because we understand that all of us have a stake in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us can pursue reform alone or in isolation. There needs to be a new culture of partnership and collaboration, as exemplified by the RDG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade unions and train operators, Network Rail and the ORR, government and industry. We must all work together. We must all do our bit because we all stand to lose if rail becomes ever less competitive and ever less affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks---the-only-game-in-town"&gt;Concluding remarks - the only game in town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This audience knows better than anyone that our railways cost more than they used to and more than they ought to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also know that such a state of affairs is as unsustainable as it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left unaddressed it will hurt passengers, freight operators and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it will hit the industry and, in the long term, perhaps even damage our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can’t afford to side-step this issue or kick it down the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we invest and modernise we must also change and reform - that really is the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a railway that is efficient, that helps to drive our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A railway that is affordable for hard pressed taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A railway that, first, last and always, delivers for the people who are its commercial life blood - its passengers, its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s a huge challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It requires us to be brave enough to think differently and bold enough to act decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it demands that we work together and work smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when I come to events like this - and when I think about the expertise and experience that the RDG, and key industry players like all of you, bring to this task - I am convinced it’s a challenge we can and will meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Speech at the Northern Rail conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Anton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to be back in Leeds to take part in Northern Rail’s conference today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to congratulate their parent group, Abellio, on winning the Greater Anglia short franchise today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they are half as successful with this new contract as they have been with Northern, I’m sure passengers in East Anglia will be in for a really high quality service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course it’s been all change at the Department for Transport over the last week and this is a welcome opportunity to pass on the good wishes of the new Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like her predecessor, Justine Greening fully recognises the crucial role rail plays in our economy and the vital importance of improving rail infrastructure in the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so today I propose to take you through some of our key goals and ambitions for rail in the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="context-three-years-of-change"&gt;Context: Three years of change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s three years since Northern hosted its first Rail Summit in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who were at the inaugural summit may remember the theme that day was the role of rail in delivering growth - a well chosen theme, considering the crisis in our economy in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew then that the road to recovery would be long and tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still paying the price for Gordon Brown’s reckless decision to borrow excessively during the boom years leaving the cupboard absolutely bare when the bad times arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget that it was only May last year when the coalition inherited the largest deficit in our nation’s peacetime history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And across government, we are taking the tough action needed to tackle the deficit, support growth, and cut carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tight control on spending, combined with a robust plan to stimulate enterprise and jobs, we’re taking the right route - the only credible route - to a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every department and every industry has a contribution to make, including the rail sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly 200 years, the railway has been bringing prosperity to the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting people with the workplace, and goods with the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing the links on which businesses rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we believe that rail can play a vital role in spurring growth in modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the coalition is today overseeing the biggest rail upgrade programme since the Victorian era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, British governments have responded to the need to rein in spending by reducing capital investment - typically in large scale infrastructure schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly not because it makes economic sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that capital projects traditionally lose out during times of fiscal retrenchment because cutting other areas of public spending is more politically difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, though, our priorities are clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll do what’s best for our economy, and what’s best for our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite severe pressure on budgets, we have made a strategic choice to increase capital investment in those parts of the infrastructure that best deliver sustainable economic growth - including rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why rail was allocated £18bn of funding in last year’s ‘Spending review’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has come with a downside - an RPI +3% increase in fares for three years to help fund the vital improvements we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even taking that into account, rail came out of the spending review far more strongly than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think the outgoing Secretary of State deserved all the many accolades he received for his part in securing that result in the CSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rail-investment-in-the-north"&gt;Rail investment in the north&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why the Chancellor chose to prioritise investment in rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only can rail deliver growth. It can deliver more balanced sustainable economic growth across the country, helping to tackle the prosperity gap that continues to divide north and south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So £300m will be invested in rail electrification in the north west over the next 6 years, upgrading crucial routes between Manchester, Liverpool, and Wigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will deliver significant environmental, economic and passenger benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also allow these lines to benefit from the rolling stock cascade triggered by the Thameslink programme and allow existing diesel trains to be used on other routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after it was first proposed, the Ordsall Chord has finally got the go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase one of the Northern Hub programme, the Ordsall Chord project will tackle a major bottleneck in the network, and enable faster and much more frequent services to run across the north of England - including between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Hull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real investment in rail in the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And real support for the northern economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recognise the benefits that the remainder of the Northern Hub programme could offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be looking very seriously at the whole proposal in the run up to next July’s HLOS 2 statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s no doubt that the package as a whole is an expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordability issues will need careful consideration, and it will be necessary to make a judgment on the different components individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to be an ‘all-or-nothing’ decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside measures to improve the infrastructure, we’re also modernising our rolling stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next generation of Intercity Express trains is due to be built by Hitachi at a new assembly plant in County Durham… creating at least 500 jobs directly, plus thousands more in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, we’re investing in 2,700 new carriages across the rail network to ease overcrowding on many routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right here in Leeds commuters are set to benefit from an extra 2,000 seats a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that talking about rolling stock in the north of England can be risky if you’re the rail minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that many passengers would like to see the Pacers heading into retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you here in this room will know that building a business case for new rolling stock is always going to be difficult when fares in much of the north of England lag so very far behind the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget the growing importance of light rail in the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are investing up to £350 million over the next 10 years to upgrade the Tyne and Wear metro… the largest renewal project since the metro was built more than 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Metrolink extension is going ahead in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network was built under a conservative government - and this conservative-led government continues to recognise the great benefits trams and light rail can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tram Train Project between Sheffield and Rotherham is also progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are currently considering proposals to develop the trolleybus scheme here in Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="high-speed"&gt;High speed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our very significant commitment to updating and improving the existing railway, we also recognise its inherent constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a 19th century network - valiantly struggling to support a 21st century economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It simply will not be able to absorb the growth in demand that we expect to see over the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why in 2008, in opposition, I championed high speed rail - at a time when the Labour government had dismissed it as an option and ruled it out of their 30 year strategy for the railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said then and I continue to believe that this is a project which can transform the economic and social geography of Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the allegations made by its detractors, HS2 is not, and never has been, about shaving a few minutes off the journey time to Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is about meeting the long term transport needs of our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is about delivering the intercity transport links that are absolutely crucial for future economic success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that high speed rail will do more to tackle the economic imbalance between the north and south than any policy tried by long the succession of governments that have grappled with this seemingly intractable problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we are clear that the scheme will deliver benefits to the whole country, it is the north that stands to get most from HS2 - in the same way regional cities around Europe have flourished when connected to high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High speed would not only transform journey times, reliability, and choice on our railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also free up huge amounts of capacity on existing lines, providing space for more commuter, regional and freight services on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after one of the largest and most complex public consultations in government history, we are currently analysing thousands of responses from passengers, local communities, environmental groups, businesses, local authorities, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will publish our response towards the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="value-for-moneydevolution"&gt;Value for money/devolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvements I’ve outlined this morning will deliver more capacity, better connectivity, and better services for rail passengers in the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on their own they’re not enough to meet the challenges faced by all of us who care about the UK’s railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you know the issue I’m coming to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Roy McNulty’s study set out the scale of the challenge - with his conclusion that Britain’s rail network is now up to 40% more expensive per passenger mile than those of our European competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has contributed to increasing public concern about the level of rail fares in many parts of the country, particularly the south east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also led to some of the highest levels of public subsidy in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This high-cost status quo is neither acceptable nor sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are carefully considering carefully the detailed recommendations that Sir Roy produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes assessing the scope there is to devolve more responsibility for commissioning local and regional services from the centre to local bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we do in so many areas, this government recognises the benefits localised decision-making can bring to transport. Strengthening accountability to local communities and passengers, deploying local knowledge and understanding of the consequences of different choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of community rail gives us a hint of the benefits local input and commitment can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refranchising process for Northern and TPE will provide a real opportunity to test the case for devolving more decisions to local authorities and PTEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions are ongoing between the DfT and the PTEs, with a number of options on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many issues to resolve, not least of which is whether to devolve right down to a very local area or try to create a consortia of local authorities to input into decisions across more of the Northern franchise network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as well as a more localist approach, we also want a more transparent one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing the public with more visibility over where rail subsidy is being spent won’t be without controversy - but it is an important part of our strategy for reducing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the department’s business plan, we have made a firm commitment to greater transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already started to publish information about where subsidy is allocated, on a franchise by franchise basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes direct TOC funding from the government and an estimate of how much of Network Rail’s grant can be attributed to the infrastructure used by each franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re moving towards breaking down performance data by line rather than just the overall figures for the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we want to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in due course we want passengers to know the real cost of the services they are using, and how much their fares are contributing to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key area for reform is franchising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pressed ahead with this from the early days of the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition agreement commits us to longer more flexible franchises and a departure from the excessive micro-management that characterised the approach of the previous government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By introducing longer, less prescriptive franchises, we want to give the industry more freedom to innovate, and a stronger incentive to invest in better services and address passenger needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our draft specification for the West Coast franchise published in the summer represents a significantly more flexible approach than the rigid timetable and service specifications of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft ITT set out a framework which continued to mandate key elements of service, such as minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day but give the winning bidder greater scope to organise services in a more commercial way and to respond to peaks and troughs of passenger demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re replacing the “cap and collar” revenue support system with a GDP risk-sharing arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will continue to offer train operators some protection from the big macro-economic risks that it’s expensive for them to take on; but it avoids some of the perversities of the cap and collar regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will build on these changes in future franchise competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, West Coast is a staging post in a progressive reform we will roll out as our major programme of refranchising moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course in the future we propose to include in franchises the sort of aligned incentives that Sir Roy McNulty identified as a key way to address the high unit cost of the railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much work remains to be done but Network Rail is already devolving its operations to give route managers more autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And work is actively underway between Network Rail and operators such as Scotrail and SWT to develop the alliances that could play an important part of delivering the strong shared incentives needed to get costs down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most difficult of all, we’ll be reviewing fares regulation to see if we can eliminate some of the many anomalies it contains, smooth out the most extreme cliff edges, and better incentivise off-peak travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me make it absolutely clear that as part of this process I will be expecting the rail industry to step up to the plate to ensure that they deliver a more user-friendly system for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern fares system that helps fill up empty trains and spends less on transport thin air is bound to involve some complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So an important component of a successful reform should be aimed at ensuring that when passengers buy tickets, they can navigate the choices available and find the best ticket for their journey without too much uncertainty and too much hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I genuinely believe that the measures I have outlined today represent a serious and credible programme to generate growth and strengthen the competitiveness of the north of England by improving its transport infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they give us the chance to deliver a real shot in the arm for the northern economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chance to deliver the improved capacity and connections that cities and communities across the north need to grow and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us should underestimate the scale of the task on which we have embarked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering the change we need will require a huge effort from both industry and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am confident that an industry that has achieved so much in recent years - an industry that has reversed a long term trend of decline - will be equal the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>London Chamber of Commerce and Industry Transport Dinner</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction Willie (Willie Walsh, &lt;abbr title="London Chamber of Commerce and Industry"&gt;LCCI&lt;/abbr&gt; President) - it’s an absolute pleasure to be with you this evening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am deeply honoured that the Prime Minister has entrusted me with the job of Transport Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also hugely excited about my new role. And that’s because I know just how much high-performing transport systems matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They matter to our economy, our society and our environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They matter to our collective well-being and our individual quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they matter because they make a difference not just today, but for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am looking forward to the task ahead immensely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually my first speech as Transport Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, at a time when the economy and the future of business is front and centre of all of our thinking, it is perhaps appropriate that I should be speaking to the &lt;abbr title="London Chamber of Commerce and Industry"&gt;LCCI&lt;/abbr&gt; - the respected voice of London business. I have met many of you before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while no Minister ever wants to disappoint an audience, you’ll forgive me if I don’t use tonight as an opportunity to set out my entire transport manifesto chapter and verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I will say though is this: as Transport Secretary I will have a laser focus on ensuring that transport remains right where it should be - at the top of this government’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="testing-times"&gt;Testing Times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As wealth creators and business leaders you, the members of the &lt;abbr title="London Chamber of Commerce and Industry"&gt;LCCI&lt;/abbr&gt;, will know better than most the two big challenges facing Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global economy under severe strain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, here at home, the coalition inherited a deficit as bad as any in this nation’s peacetime history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - challenges both home-grown and international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges for London too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a capital city whose population is projected to grow by nearly a million people in the next twenty years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as a city where 24 million journeys take place every working day on our transport system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so often a gateway into our economy but also out to the global market-place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and as the 2012 host to the greatest show on earth - the Olympic Games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond any question we are living in testing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we confront those challenges and meet those tests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we sharpen Britain’s competitive edge - improve our productivity, become the best place in the world to do business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we harness London’s power to drive the UK economy - to generate growth and create jobs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I want to argue that modernising Britain’s transport infrastructure is the key to answering these crucially important questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="strong-foundations-economic-stability"&gt;Strong foundations, economic stability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in our transport infrastructure means a better connected society and, if we invest it wisely, a cleaner and greener environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also good economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting commuting times and speeding up journey times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving people and products in a more reliable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s how I want to see my role, one of backing British business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can only build a modern transport system on strong foundations - and that means ensuring economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the coalition was formed nearly 18 months ago, we knew we faced perhaps the toughest agenda of any government in modern British history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from day one, we have been absolutely clear about our priorities - tackling, first and foremost, the record budget deficit inherited from our predecessors, and rebuilding our economy after a long and deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our resolve has been vindicated by Standard and Poor’s recent confirmation of Britain’s “Triple A” credit rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also focused on jobs and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’ve launched the ‘Growth review’ and announced a “credit easing” scheme to help small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why, in the wake of the Thameslink rolling stock award, we’re taking a long, hard look at public procurement policy - I believe in the free market, but I also believe in a level playing field for British firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also why we are reforming our employment laws, modernising our planning regulations, and easing the burden of regulation - policies to give businesses the room to grow and the conditions to invest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-clear-break-a-different-choice"&gt;A clear break, a different choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless amongst the tough choices, there are some extremely positive ones. We have made a clear break from past governments by supporting capital investment at a time of fiscal retrenchment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under previous administrations, capital investment was always first to suffer when cuts needed to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-termism became the British disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By putting in place strong foundations for long-term economic stability we are making a different choice - to invest in our transport infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year’s ‘Spending review’ was a statement of our intent - a bold commitment to invest over £30 billion in road, rail and local transport projects across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to further support infrastructure investment and other development projects, we have also just announced £500 million Growing Places fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fruits of our focused investment are becoming clear to see, not least in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if we want London to be globally competitive, it’s absolutely vital that London has a world class transport infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support a labour productivity rate here in the capital that’s more than 31% above the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain the city’s position as the financial capital of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to fuel an economy that accounts for around 19% of UK GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London is Britain’s economic engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, by investing in the transport infrastructure that serves and supports the capital, we can keep that engine powered up - for the benefit of the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="investments-modernisations-boosting-london"&gt;Investments modernisations boosting London&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re cutting congestion on key strategic roads, like the M25, through innovations such as hard shoulder running and managed motorway technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My predecessor rightly won plaudits for shutting down the much derided M4 Bus Lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he also announced a review of the decades old 70 mph motorway speed limit to speed up journey times and support economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run up to the 2012 Olympics, £6.5 billion has been invested to modernise transport systems in and around London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first ever domestic high speed train in Britain taking passengers from St Pancras to the Olympic Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More tube trains and, more seats for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line extensions and new stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incredible transport legacy for London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Olympics our Thameslink Programme will double capacity on one of Europe’s busiest stretches of railway and make travelling across London and the south east faster, easier and more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pushing ahead with a multi-billion pound upgrade of the Tube as well as the transformational Crossrail project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together they will add 30 per cent capacity to the region’s rail network and provide an estimated £78 billion boost to the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London will also benefit from investment in national transport infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not least from our proposals for a truly national high speed rail network - &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; has the potential to transform the entire country’s social and economic geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But think also of the potential positives for London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better connectivity and faster journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our major cities and regions brought closer to the capital…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New opportunities, new markets and new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have consulted widely on our &lt;abbr title="High Speed Two"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; proposals, we are considering the many thousands of responses carefully and we will publish our response towards the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London’s key transport infrastructure doesn’t begin and end with its road and rail links, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For centuries, shipping has been instrumental in bringing prosperity to London and the South East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2013 there will be a new deep sea container port and business park at London Gateway, with DP World’s very welcome recent announcement of a £1.5 billion investment in the port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driven by private finance, this project will mean the world’s biggest container ships can call at the heart of Britain’s capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help create 32,000 jobs and add £3.2 billion to the national economy each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vote of confidence in the future of London, and in UK Plc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="heathrow-aviation---transport-is-not-a-zero-sum-game"&gt;Heathrow aviation - transport is not a zero sum game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s another vital international gateway that is grabbing all the headlines during my first week as Transport Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="heathrow"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I accept that the government’s decision on Heathrow’s third runway has had its share of critics - not least in this room tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while it’s no secret that, in the past, Willie and I have been on different sides of the aviation fence on this one, we both inhabit the same world of political reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the political reality is that the runway decision has been made, it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me also say this. The decision we took on the third runway does not make this government anti-aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it certainly doesn’t make me anti-aviation. Far from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know just how many of my constituents rely on an efficient, effective and successful Heathrow - for work and for travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I am concerned transport is not a zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, socially, environmentally every mode has an impact, every form of travel is a crucial part of the total mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that includes aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passionately believe that the success of our airports and airlines is critical to the success of London and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transport choices I make and the decisions I take will only ever be informed by the long term interest of this city, and this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Willie, what I want to do is work with key players like you, and with the wider aviation industry, to change the nature of the aviation debate - to move forward constructively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I want to build on the work my department has already carried out engaging with the &lt;abbr title="London Chamber of Commerce and Industry"&gt;LCCI&lt;/abbr&gt;, listening to your views on the future of aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly believe we can leave behind the polarised opinions that have dominated the discussion in the past. That we can find common sense, common ground - an inclusive consensus for change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do that then I am certain we can improve and reform airport regulation and we can develop a new ‘Aviation strategy’ for the long term - one that supports economic growth while addressing the environmental impacts of airports and flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s precisely why, through our scoping document, we have asked questions and engaged widely on a range of aviation issues - such as the economic benefits of aviation and the role of a UK hub airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely confident that, if we change the nature of the aviation debate, then we will be able to generate a little less heat and shed a lot more light on the big challenges facing the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I have argued that we are facing challenges which are in many ways unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also argued that, to meet these challenges, requires a stable economy and focused investment in our transport infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government is working hard to deliver both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a policy approach which makes sense for London - helping to cement its position as a competitive, productive, wealth-creating global player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also makes sense for the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, when you have an economic engine as powerful as London’s then, for the sake of the entire national economy, you need to make sure it can fire on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what our policies are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes - these are testing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, you have a government determined to rebalance our economy and modernise our transport networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are blessed with a capital that enjoys advantages which are the envy of cities around the world - from the global reputation of its financial sector, to the rich diversity of its cultural life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe we can boast a business community with the dynamism and determination to out-compete and out-produce any company and any nation any where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I know we can meet this moment and show the world why London is a great city and Britain is a great country with a great future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay: in my first speech as Transport Secretary the last thing I want to do is keep an audience from their dinner - that’s no way to build a future working relationship with Britain’s businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thank-you for listening and I look forward to working closely with you all in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport Times, National Transport Awards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. It’s a pleasure to be with you all this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is a celebration of excellence and achievement by some of the brightest and the best in the transport industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everything from innovations in transport planning, to improving safety, to safeguarding the environment, the shortlist of nominations for this year demonstrates clearly the innovation and dedication that exists throughout this exciting sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen nominations for individuals and teams; employees and operators; small projects and big projects; local and national initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All very different, yet all with something in common - because every single one of them shows the difference that the people of this industry make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transport-infrastructure---a-fundamental-component-of-the-economy"&gt;Transport infrastructure - a fundamental component of the economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this event matters is because transport matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started this job, nearly 18 months ago, I made clear that Britain’s transport system should be an engine for economic recovery - playing a vital role in getting this country open for business again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern transport networks are the arteries of commerce, moving people to the workplace and goods to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we modernise our infrastructure, and encourage more sustainable forms of travel, we can cut carbon emissions, improve air quality, and offer a cleaner, greener transport system and a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having inherited a deficit greater than any in our nation’s peacetime history, it would have been easy for us to slash capital investment and side-step the politically challenging cuts in current spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, for decades this has been the traditional response of British governments to fiscal pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And transport is usually a favourite target of the swinging axe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not this time, and not this government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been prepared to take the tough decisions on current spending programmes and on welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transport-investments"&gt;Transport investments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from being targeted, transport capital emerged as a major winner in last year’s spending review - with a commitment to invest over £30 billion in road, rail and local transport capital projects right across our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s more than Labour invested in the previous four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are prioritising the projects that will get Britain back on the path to growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest programme of rail investment since the Victorian era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2,700 new rail carriages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A massive rail electrification programme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green light for Crossrail and Thameslink and the Intercity Express Train&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multi-billion pound tube upgrade programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re investing £400m in support for ultra low emission vehicles to progressively green our car fleet - while bringing a new Nissan production line to Sunderland with hundreds of new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping to get Britain making things again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="re-inventing-how-we-work"&gt;Re-inventing how we work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So transport investment can be a driver for economic growth. But transport also has to contribute to deficit reduction. And our commitment to investment must be balanced with a determination to re-examine and re-invent the way we do business, so we maximise efficiency and value for public money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, on our railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you all know, our railways are among the most expensive in Europe - with some of the highest fares in Europe and the highest levels of taxpayer subsidy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the short term, we’ve had to take another tough decision: to increase fares above inflation, so we can carry on investing to tackle overcrowding and unreliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it simply isn’t sustainable to go on paying for the inefficiency of the railway with above inflation fare rises and massive public subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to solve this problem from the bottom up - by improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Theresa Villiers, the rail Minister, and I will shortly publish a comprehensive blueprint for reforming our railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking the hard questions about taxpayer subsidy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and considering the options for greater local commissioning of services,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as we seek to drive cost-saving innovations in service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking again at the role of government, Network Rail, and the train operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligning the interests of all the parties&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Train Operators more accountable to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and Network Rail more accountable to the train operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And giving railway employees a real interest in the success of the companies they work for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also looking ahead to the future with our plans for a new high speed rail network linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project that would transform the social and economic geography of Britain - slashing journey times and putting desperately-needed new capacity on our railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as helping to close the North-South gap that has plagued our economy for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="aviation"&gt;Aviation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And talking of the longer term, we’re also working with the industry to develop a new long-term strategy for aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out how best to plan for aviation expansion on a sustainable basis, within the limits implied by our carbon reduction targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting out a way forward for the next 40 years that will generate economic growth, meet our decarbonisation objectives, and manage the noise, and other impacts on local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kickstarting what will be, I hope, a new chapter in the aviation policy debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="roads"&gt;Roads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we are thinking smarter about how we get our roads and motorways working better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re investing £10 bn in our roads as part of the Spending Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ve already talked about our intention to ensure that the car can retain a place in our future transport plans - by focussing on the real enemy, the carbon, rather than bashing the motorist, and making sure Britain becomes a leader in Europe in low-emission vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also have to be innovative and flexible about making the best use of the roads we have already paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one area, it might be peak time, or even permanent, hard shoulder running to ease congestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another, it might be variable speed limits to keep traffic flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, we’re consulting on a new motorway speed limit - a move that would put Britain back in the fast lane of global economies, boost productivity and deliver hundreds of millions of pounds of economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping ensure our strategic roads become the arteries of commerce they were always intended to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="localism"&gt;Localism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about our national networks. The transport issues that most concern communities are often local in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, for far too long in this country, important decisions about local transport have been taken, and monitored, centrally - by Ministers and civil servants sitting in Whitehall, ticking boxes and filling in forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we overhauled the way funding is delivered - slashing the number of separate local transport grant streams from 26 to just four, giving local authorities much greater flexibility and freedom to decide their own priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have recently announced my intention to consult on how we can fully devolve decisions and funding for local capital transport improvements to “Local Transport Consortia”, each made up of a number of Local Enterprise Partnerships and their constituent local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting decision making power where it belongs - in the hands of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="all-the-nominees-should-feel-very-proud-of-themselves"&gt;All the nominees should feel very proud of themselves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are important times for the transport industry - no doubt about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we seek to ride out the economic storm, we must continue to target investment where it makes the most difference, find new and innovative ways to fund capital expenditure, and continue relentlessly to control the costs of the projects we undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, it will be a tough challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if these awards tonight demonstrate anything, it is that those who work in our transport sector have the capability, the ingenuity, and the commitment to meet that challenge head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when push comes to shove, it’s the people in transport who really make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make the difference because they understand the needs of the businesses and individuals that use our transport networks every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make the difference because of their commitment to meeting those needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they make the difference through the skills they bring to delivering those vital transport improvements on the ground (or in the air!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s who, and what, we are honouring tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And over the coming months and years, I look forward to working with all of you to make our shared vision of a world-class British transport system a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you for listening, have a great night and the best of luck to all the nominees as they wait to hear if they have won an award.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Speech at the Aviation Club lunch</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a pleasure to be joining you this afternoon. It’s now just over a year since the coalition came to office. Just over a year since I somewhat unexpectedly - at least to me - became Transport Secretary. And just over a year since the new government set out its priorities very clearly: cutting the deficit, re-establishing sustainable growth and reducing carbon. And, with that cue, it was pretty straightforward for me arriving in my new department to define my objectives for the Department for Transport: to ensure that the transport agenda supports economic growth, while contributing to deficit reduction and carbon reduction. And the challenge for my department, in particular, is to demonstrate that ‘supporting economic growth’ and ‘reducing carbon’ are not mutually incompatible aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere more so than in aviation. Virtually the first act of this government was to announce the scrapping of the third runway at Heathrow - an act which will have come as no surprise to anyone who had read the Conservative or Liberal Democrats manifestos, but which I know many in your industry nonetheless felt was loaded with hostile symbolism. It was not. I made clear at the earliest opportunity - and I want to do so again today - that this government is not and at least, so long as I am Transport Secretary, will not be, ‘anti-aviation’. Far from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It understands that the aviation sector is an important part of the economy in its own right - sustaining tens of thousands of jobs - but even more critically, that aviation supports economic growth and the generation of wealth across the whole economy. If we ever had any doubts about our dependence on aviation, the closing of our airspace for 5 days last year will have dispelled them. So we clearly understand that, if our economy is to grow, aviation must also be able to grow. We surely share the starting point. But we are also clear that, with the challenge of global warming as stark as ever, even if attention is understandably focussed at the moment on the short-term economic challenges, that growth cannot be at any cost. So we - the industry and government - must work together to define a growth strategy for aviation that will support UK economic growth, but which will also support the delivery of our decarbonisation commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we have committed to delivering a new ‘Aviation strategy’ - and have published a scoping document, setting out our views on the issues that strategy needs to address. Beginning, I hope, a new chapter in the aviation policy debate. In particular, we must find new ways to incentivise the decarbonisation of air travel - and encourage investment in low-carbon technologies and fuels. Ensuring we can lead the global debate and shape a low-emission aviation sector of the future, without disadvantaging UK airlines or UK airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the inclusion of aviation in the European Emissions Trading System next year is an important step, it is not clear that it alone will provide sufficient incentive to drive innovation quickly or deeply enough. We will continue to work with ICAO and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to push for international agreement on aviation emissions, ensuring that the playing field is level as quickly as possible. We saw a step forward - albeit a modest one - last year when ICAO adopted an aspirational goal for stabilising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the environmental framework increasingly constraining the shape and direction of aviation growth, it is clear that, if we are to continue enjoying the significant benefits of a growing, deregulated aviation industry, then we need to put aviation on a more sustainable footing. So our policy framework must support economic growth and protect Heathrow’s status as a global hub. But it must also address aviation’s effects on climate change and its impact on local communities. A tall order you might think. Growing the sector, while decarbonising - and all within the constraints we face on local environmental impacts - primarily noise. So, I want to explore with you what the industry expects technological change to be able to deliver, over the next thirty or forty years - on carbon, on noise, on air quality - and on what timescale you expect those development to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a resourceful, innovative industry, and I am convinced that there is a solution to these challenges -providing the headroom for growth as first trading, and then technology, provides the answer to the carbon challenge - while the continued progress of engine design will, over time, create headroom for growth by reducing per flight noise impacts. It is vitally important that we get this strategy right, and I have set the timescale for this exercise to ensure that the views of all parts of the industry are properly heard and that all the issues can be fully explored. So we do not expect to publish our new ‘Aviation strategy’ until 2013, but by taking the time that is necessary, we will ensure the outcome is a positive and enduring policy framework that will deliver the benefits of a flourishing air transport sector, while also meeting our environmental goals. In the meantime, there are many more immediate challenges to face - on safety and security, on improving the passenger experience, and on making the best use of existing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ash"&gt;Ash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent challenge we have faced has been the unwelcome eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano in Iceland. Our response this time was much more measured and effective than last year, and meant we could avoid the blanket closures of airspace that we saw twelve months ago. That does not mean we cannot do better next time. Together with better data on the height and concentration of ash, and a much improved understanding of the effect of ash on aircraft, we benefited from a much improved regulatory safety regime. This allowed airlines to fly in predicted concentrations of ash which last year would have seen airspace closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urgent need now is to improve the quality of input data to the ash dispersion model. Using a feedback loop from the observed actual distribution and concentration of ash to reassess the interpretation of the at-source data in the modelling inputs. By improving the quality of input data to the model, we can expect progressively more accurate outputs and better informed decisions.  That is why I announced last week that I have asked the government’s Chief Scientist, Professor Sir John Beddington, to chair a Peer Review Group to work with the Met Office to establish how best to use the actual observation data to refine inputs to the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the predictive accuracy of the model must be our top priority. But in the meantime, we need to widen the range of inputs the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; uses in establishing red zones, where ash is forecast to be above the 4,000 microgram level, so they are not simply mechanical extrapolations of the dispersion model. So the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; has established a Volcanic Ash Advisory Group, comprising representatives from the Met Office,     and airlines, working together to develop an improved methodology to analyse data from a range of sources to produce an accurate, real time, working picture of developing ash concentrations - which will inform the definition of the Red Zone in future events. I am confident this approach will further, significantly, reduce the impact of future ash events on aviation. We hope to reach a broad international agreement on this revised two-pronged approach quickly. Working together, we can satisfy the passenger’s twin demand for safety and convenience, while avoiding the significant economic costs of airspace closures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="security"&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for collaboration is not, of course, limited to unexpected events like volcanic eruptions. Routine issues of aviation security also remain an evolving challenge where we need a co-ordinated approach. And we are in the process of developing a new aviation security regulatory system where the government concentrates on setting the security outcomes that need to be achieved, while freeing up operators to devise the processes needed to deliver them, within the constraints of EU requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be consulting with the industry on this approach later this year, but, in the meantime, we are undertaking a limited ‘call for evidence’ exercise which aims to better understand the potential savings, costs and wider benefits of this new regulatory approach. I look forward to your contributions to this process. Meanwhile, we will continue to work in partnership internationally to tackle the ever-changing terror threat. Most recently, this has focussed on inbound cargo, where it was clear that weaknesses existed, had been identified by the enemy, and were very nearly successfully exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome the package of proposals around cargo security that the EU has put forward. I am disappointed that yesterday’s vote failed to secure a majority in favour of this package. This is a clear example of where action at a European level will be in our national interest. We will continue to press for a pan-European approach on inbound cargo. But in the meantime, my officials will work with UK airlines to ensure that we have in place for the UK a system that is risk-based, proportionate and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="passenger-experienceprotection"&gt;Passenger experience/protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safety and security of airline passengers must be the first priority of both government and the industry, but we all recognise that the passenger experience goes far beyond this. And as customer expectations, and the industry itself, evolve, so too must the framework for the economic regulation of our main airports, which is now 25 years old. Our philosophy is clear: the change that is needed must be achieved not through micro-management by regulators, but by properly alignment of economic incentives. So in the next session of this parliament, in the spring of next year we will legislate for a new regime that will significantly enhance the quality of service that airlines and passengers receive - by aligning the operators’ economic interest more closely with that of passengers, and the airlines who carry them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new framework we propose will encourage improvements, incentivise investment, focus on the needs of customers, and ensure that passenger benefits are delivered with the minimum of regulatory interference. Ensuring that London’s airports give a positive first impression of the UK to arriving visitors, and leave the right image in departing passengers’ minds. Meanwhile, our South East Airports Taskforce - which is looking at ways to make the best use of existing airport infrastructure - will report in July, and I am grateful to everyone in the industry for their commitment and input to that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important to passengers is ensuring that we deliver the right kind of protection when things do, occasionally, go wrong. That means greater resilience at airports - which we will achieve through the reformed economic regime. And modernisation of the current outdated &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers' Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; scheme, which was poorly understood by passengers. We will be launching our consultation on &lt;abbr title="Air Travel Organisers' Licensing"&gt;ATOL&lt;/abbr&gt; reform shortly. And at the European level, I welcome the fact that the Commission intends to look again at regulation EC 261.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we would all agree that the establishment of common rules on compensation and welfare support for passengers was an important step forward. But I am equally clear in my own mind that there is no such thing as a free lunch - and with the cost of flying lower than ever before, I am unconvinced that generous, fixed-sum passenger compensation, which bears no relation to ticket price, can really be in the long-term best interest of passengers or a diverse and competitive industry. I shall be continuing to urge the Commission to find a way forward that is fair to passengers, simple to operate, and easy to understand. As well as being in line with our goal of a strong, prosperous and competitive aviation sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the coming months, there will be much for us to discuss as we work to map out a sustainable growth strategy for aviation in the UK - while dealing with some of the more immediately pressing issues along the way. There will be further challenges, and, doubtless, further disagreements, ahead - no doubt about that. I have come to appreciate the forthrightness with which your industry’s more colourful characters like to express their views. But I have also learned that this is a resourceful, innovative, flexible, and fast responding industry - able to deal with a difficult and fast moving environment. I repeat my desire - the government’s desire - to see the aviation sector prosper, and our determination to work with you to make sure that can happen, while delivering our environmental goals. I can promise you that I will engage with you with an open mind and an open door, as we work through the key policy challenges in the months ahead. And I am confident that, by working together, we can build a strong and prosperous future for this vitally important national industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transcript"&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrator: Rail Minister Theresa Villiers attended the launch of the Crossrail Station Design Exhibition being hosted by Crossrail and New London Architecture. The exhibition provides a glimpse of what Crossrail will look like in the future. But these new stations will be far more than iconic architecture for London’s travellers, as Theresa Villiers explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theresa Villiers, Minister of State for Transport: I think we’ve seen some great designs here at this exhibition today. I think they can really have a dramatic effect on the, sort of, quality of the travel experience in London; we’re really getting a glimpse of how Crossrail can change the way we travel in London and also produce some really significant regeneration benefits for the areas immediately around the Crossrail stations, as well as, on top of, the overall benefits that the project as a whole delivers for the capital and for the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrator: Importantly, as Mayor Boris Johnson is keen to point out, these new stations will be catalysts for growth in their local area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson, Mayor of London: We’re going to create urban spaces where people are going to collect and meet, shop, and thereby, of course, we’re going to drive economic growth - because a lot of this is about taking Crossrail and leveraging it to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrator: Crossrail is a project of national significance, which will benefit not only London but the country as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theresa Villiers: Crossrail will bring very significant benefits to the whole of the UK economy - the benefits will be felt well beyond the capital in generating growth and jobs. That’s one of the reasons why Crossrail has been given the go-ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrator: Analysis suggests that alongside the core transport benefits, Crossrail could generate up to £50 billion of wider economic benefits to the UK GDP and facilitate the creation of up to 30,000 jobs across London.  The Crossrail station exhibition runs until 8 September at New London Architecture, the Building Centre in Store Street, London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>EU Transport Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will attend the first Transport Council of the Danish Presidency (the Presidency) which will take place in Brussels on Thursday 22 March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency hopes to achieve general approach on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Union guidelines for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network (&lt;abbr title="Trans-European Transport Network"&gt;TEN-T&lt;/abbr&gt;). Progress to date has been encouraging. The revised text issued by the Presidency has gone some way to addressing our concerns particularly in relation to binding standards and deadlines. And also by recognising the need to take account of Member States’ finances and to consider the economic viability of projects. Additionally, I will continue to push for changes on the Core Network and &lt;abbr title="Trans-European Transport Network"&gt;TEN-T&lt;/abbr&gt; corridors to minimise risks to the UK. I will consider whether the improvements achieved are satisfactory to justify UK support for a general approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council. This proposal would amend the specification for tachographs, which measure hours spent at the wheel by commercial lorry and bus drivers. The proposed general approach addresses many of the concerns raised through negotiations, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing the proposed ban of operators with tachograph workshops from installing or calibrating tachographs in their own vehicles. Member States are left to take appropriate measures to prevent conflicts of interests between workshops and operators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removing the proposal to merge the driving licence with the tachograph card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These represent significant gains for the UK with regard to minimising costs and burdens on industry and the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on ground-handling services at EU airports and repealing Council Directive 96/67/EC (part of the airport package). The proposed regulation has been subject to intense official-level scrutiny by Council Working Groups and these discussions are ongoing. Progress to date has been encouraging from a UK perspective, and we believe that the resulting regulation could potentially help further open-up market access while minimising administrative and financial burdens for industry. However, at this stage, it remains unclear whether or not it will be possible to seek a general approach at the March Council. If it is not possible, there will be an orientation debate instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under any other business, the Commission will provide information on the Costa Concordia accident, the Aviation Emissions Trading System and the Galileo and EGNOS Programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
