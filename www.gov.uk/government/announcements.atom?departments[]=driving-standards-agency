    <title>Green light for driving tests at Halfords</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Plans to offer practical driving tests from branches of Halfords have been given the go ahead by Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving tests will be available from the Halfords store in Wellingborough from Tuesday 5 February. Other branches of Halfords across the country are expected to start offering tests in coming months. All tests will be conducted by Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) examiners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move is part of an initiative to offer a more local service for driving test candidates. As well as using conventional test centres, &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; is working with public and private sector partners to provide driving tests in areas that don’t have a local test centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are very pleased to be working with Halfords to provide a more local service for driving test candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a great example of working with private sector partners to provide an important local service that is convenient as well as being cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfords Commercial Director, Paul McClenaghan, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Halfords is already a local destination for motorists, who come to us for a diverse range of automotive products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re always seeking new ways in which to enhance our offer, so working with the Driving Standards Agency is a natural fit for the business and extends the help we are able to provide to motorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is currently consulting on proposals to improve the way all motoring services are delivered. The &lt;a href="/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy" title="Motoring Services Strategy"&gt;Motoring Services Strategy&lt;/a&gt; consultation outlines long term proposals to put customers firmly at the heart of the way motoring services are delivered, so that they best serve the consumer while getting the best possible deal for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Improving motoring services</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Consultation to suggest improvements about how motoring services are delivered.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road users, businesses and other stakeholders were today invited to suggest improvements to the way motoring services such as driving tests and vehicle licensing are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is putting customers firmly at the heart of the way motoring services are delivered so that they best serve the consumer while getting the best possible deal for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the Department for Transport is outlining broad reform proposals for the 4 motoring services agencies: Driving Standards Agency (DSA); Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA); Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you drive, run a business or pay taxes you will be a customer of ours and I hope you will have your say about how we can improve the services we offer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much progress has already been achieved and it is now much easier to use digital services to get driving licences, and sort out vehicle tax. We have also already announced that we are bringing the driving test closer to customers by exploring a range of different locations, such as colleges and retail premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there is more that can be done and this consultation is about the government listening to its customers before agreeing the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s 4 agencies are already engaged in programmes of reform to deliver long term financial stability and efficiency, and better services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation sets out a longer term view of the future of these reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position the agencies at the forefront of digital services, ensuring that those who find access to digital services difficult are supported to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support economic growth and vehicle manufacturing by reforming the Vehicle Certification Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the driving test closer to the customer by exploring opportunities to improve convenience to customers. This includes assessing options for the delivery of the practical test. We are keen to explore all options that maintain the integrity of the test and high quality standards whoever is the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transform &lt;abbr title="heaviy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;, bus and coach testing by expanding joint ventures and collaboration with private sector providers, and reducing the number of government owned test stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliver better customer services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider rationalising the number of bodies and agencies involved in delivering services - delivering services as simply as possible, increasing flexibility and innovation, improving efficiency and reducing costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 7 March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation is the department’s response to the government’s broader vision for public services as set out in the civil service reform plan, the Open Public Services white paper and the government digital strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation document can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Driving examiner strike on 30 November: candidates urged to attend tests</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Driving test candidates with a test on Friday 30 November should still come for their test despite the threat of strike action by examiners.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving examiners who are members of the Public and Commercial Services (&lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt;) union could take strike action on Friday 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) Chief Executive Rosemary Thew said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all examiners are members of the &lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt; union. Even if they are, we can’t be sure that they’ll support the strike. So we’re asking you to come for your test so it can go ahead if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the inconvenience this will cause. We’ll do everything we can to minimise disruption for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t have to contact &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to rebook if you can’t take your test because of the strike action. You should hear from the agency with a new date within 5 to 10 working days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="out-of-pocket-expenses"&gt;Out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can claim out-of-pocket expenses if your test is cancelled, but you must have turned up for your test to do this. You’ll have to rebook your own test and you won’t be able to claim expenses if you don’t turn up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/practical-driving-test-for-cars/cancelled-or-stopped-tests-and-bad-weather" title="Claiming out-of-pocket expenses"&gt;Find out how to claim out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="customer-service-centre"&gt;Customer service centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s customer service centre for practical driving tests might also be affected by strike action on Friday 30 November. You’ll still be able to &lt;a href="/browse/driving/learning-to-drive" title="Book, change or cancel practical driving tests"&gt;book, change or cancel practical driving tests&lt;/a&gt; online on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="theory-tests"&gt;Theory tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory tests aren’t affected by the strike action and will be taking place as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inside Government section of GOV.UK has been designed to make government information more easy to find and more transparent for the user. For the first time, you can begin to find out what’s happening inside government all in one place, and in a clear, consistent and transparent format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the new website looks very different from the ones it has replaced. The look is one obvious difference but many of the other significant changes are less visible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="topics"&gt;Topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now see information from multiple government departments grouped by topics. For example, you can see how policies from both &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DFT&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; are contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/economic-growth"&gt;economic growth&lt;/a&gt; or combating &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/climate-change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="clear-policies"&gt;Clear policies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From today, those departments and agencies who have moved to GOV.UK are publishing their policies according to the outcome the government is trying to achieve. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-roads-safer" title="making roads safer"&gt;making roads safer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-greenhouse-gases-and-other-emissions-from-transport" title="reducing greenhouse gases and other emissions from transport"&gt;reducing greenhouse gases and other emissions from transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes" title="increasing the number of available homes"&gt;increasing the number of available homes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each policy, you can see a list of all the related announcements, consultations and publications in one list, called ‘activity’. The activity tab makes it easy for you to track what is happening on the policies that interest you, for example all government activity that relates to &lt;a href="/government/policies/developing-a-new-high-speed-rail-network/activity" title="developing a high speed rail network: activity"&gt;developing a high speed rail network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="more-about-inside-government-and-govuk"&gt;More about Inside Government and GOV.UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see today is just the beginning, with just 2 departments and 3 other organisations live. Work will continue as other departments and organisations, many hundreds in total, move their information to GOV.UK. This will happen in batches and will be completed by March 2014.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Highway Code campaign wins top award</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A campaign encouraging road users to keep up to date with The Highway Code has won a Prince Michael International Road Safety Award.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign, run by the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) in partnership with its official publisher The Stationery Office (&lt;abbr title="The Stationery Office"&gt;TSO&lt;/abbr&gt;), has helped transform The Highway Code from a simple book into a multi-platform road safety service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign started in December 2011 with the launch of The Highway Code on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.twitter.com/HighwayCodeGB" title="The Highway Code on Twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/HighwayCodeGB" title="The Highway Code on Facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, providing daily reminders of the rules of the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed by the launch of digital editions of The Highway Code, including e-books and an official &lt;a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/official-highway-code/id522687241?mt=8" title="The Highway Code official iPhone app"&gt;iPhone app.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new formats help to make sure that all road users – not just learner drivers – know The Highway Code and stay up to date with the rules of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister, Stephen Hammond, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that our work to promote The Highway Code has been recognised with a Prince Michael International Road Safety Award. The Highway Code is the official guide to using the roads safely and responsibly and has been helping to save lives for more than 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It holds crucial information for everyone from experienced motorists and motorcyclists to horse riders and pedestrians. By keeping up with the times and embracing modern technology, The Highway Code is now more accessible than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="The Stationery Office"&gt;TSO&lt;/abbr&gt; Chief Executive Officer, Marco Pierleoni, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As experts in digital content management, &lt;abbr title="The Stationery Office"&gt;TSO&lt;/abbr&gt; is helping &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to get the essential information in The Highway Code out to more people than ever before. We’ve expanded the number of high quality, multimedia formats that The Highway Code is available in, making it easy for all road users to access it in the way that they want, on the devices that they use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Highway Code is for life - not just for learners - and these new, innovative formats are helping people to refresh their knowledge years after they’ve passed their tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.roadsafetyawards.com" title="Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards"&gt;Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards&lt;/a&gt; recognise achievements and innovations which will improve road safety. Each year the most outstanding examples of international road safety initiatives are given public recognition through the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New driving test service for Middleton</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Driving test candidates in the Middleton area will get a more local facility when a new driving test service opens in November 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mantra Learning Limited on Greengate already provides driver training courses and apprenticeships; from Tuesday 27 November it will also host car practical driving tests every Tuesday and Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is excellent news that we are going to be offering a more local driving test service for candidates in the Middleton area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Mantra Learning Ltd for supporting this initiative by providing their premises. This is a great example of how working with private sector partners can help us to deliver a more convenient and cost effective service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving test candidates will have access to Mantra’s waiting area and off road car park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All driving tests will continue to be conducted by Driving Standards Agency examiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driving standards for lorry and bus drivers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New frameworks setting out the competences expected of lorry, bus and coach drivers have been published today (24 September 2012).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frameworks define the skills, knowledge and understanding required to drive these vehicles safely and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has worked with the haulage and passenger transport industries to develop these and they address specific issues such as the use of tachographs and the dangers of continuous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-safe-responsible-driving-category-c-standard"&gt;National driving standard category C™ (lorry)&lt;/a&gt;’ and the ‘&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/dsa-safe-responsible-driving-category-d-standard"&gt;National driving standard category D™ (bus and coach)&lt;/a&gt;’ outline what drivers need to know, understand and be able to do in areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preparing a vehicle and its occupants for a journey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;guiding and controlling a vehicle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using the road in accordance with the Highway Code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;driving safely and responsibly in the traffic system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reviewing and adjusting driver behaviour over a lifetime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;DSA Chief Executive, Rosemary Thew, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The haulage and passenger transport industries are a vital part of Britain’s economy and have an important role to play in keeping our roads among the safest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The publication of these standards will help to ensure that all bus and lorry drivers acquire the right skills, knowledge and attitude to use our roads safely and responsibly, as well as contributing to cutting the human and financial cost of road accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to thank the haulage and passenger transport industries and the sector skills councils for their input into the development of the standards. These will enhance the excellent training that is already available and contribute to the work DSA is doing to set standards for everyone who uses a motorised vehicle on the public roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="training-industry-encouraged-to-create-courses"&gt;Training industry encouraged to create courses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standards should form the basis of training that a lorry, bus or coach driver receives – and so the training industry is encouraged to create courses that address them. This includes both the training that drivers complete to professionally (Driver CPC) and training for those who don’t drive for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standards build on the ‘National driving standard category B™’ that defines safe and responsible driving for car and light van drivers. They are based on evidence, open to challenge and regularly reviewed to ensure they are relevant and up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication of the standards fulfils the commitment made in the government’s ‘Strategic framework for road safety’ to extend the standards framework to cover categories C and D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driver CPC: don’t miss the bus</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Many professional bus and coach drivers have less than 1 year to complete their Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC).
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 September 2012 marks 4 years since the introduction of the Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt; for bus and coach drivers, and 3 years since its introduction for lorry drivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt;, professional bus, coach and lorry drivers have to complete 35 hours of accredited training every 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drivers who got their vocational licence before the introduction of Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt; have 5 years from its introduction to do the required 35 hours. This means the deadline for bus and coach drivers is September 2013, and for lorry drivers it is September 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt; was introduced over half a million professional drivers across the goods and passenger sectors have undertaken accredited periodic training, further developing their knowledge and skills and helping to ensure they remain safe and responsible drivers throughout their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency’s Chief Executive, Rosemary Thew, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge all drivers who haven’t yet started periodic training not to leave it until the last minute. If the deadline arrives and you drive professionally without a Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt;, you’ll be committing an offence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re an operator and you cause or allow your drivers to drive without Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt; – you’ll also be committing an offence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The idea of drivers completing regular training throughout their working life is not new – many have been doing it for years through operators who recognise the benefits of drivers developing their skills; helping to boost productivity as well as improve road safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="over-3000-training-courses"&gt;Over 3,000 training courses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now over 3,000 approved training courses available to drivers, covering a whole range of topics from fuel efficiency to tachograph and drivers’ hours regulations or defensive driving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All courses and providers have to meet strict criteria and are subject to ongoing quality assurance to ensure they meet the required standard. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Contract awarded for hazard perception clips</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The contract to refresh the hazard perception part of the driving theory test has been awarded to London-based company Jelly.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated section is expected to be introduced in August 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; met last October with companies that provide computer-generated imagery (&lt;abbr title="Computer Generated Image"&gt;CGI&lt;/abbr&gt;) services to identify new technologies that could be used to refresh the hazard perception test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January the agency started a formal procurement process and 2 early examples of &lt;abbr title="Computer Generated Image"&gt;CGI&lt;/abbr&gt; clips were published on &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s YouTube channel for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Chief Executive Rosemary Thew said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The hazards presented in the current clips are still relevant but the image quality is not as clear or defined as the quality available today. We are looking forward to presenting clips that are fresh and up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The use of computer-generated images means that we can include situations with vulnerable road users such as children, cyclists, and motorcyclists without risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTxo7qsjtFU"&gt;Example of a &lt;abbr title="Computer Generated Image"&gt;CGI&lt;/abbr&gt; clip created by Jelly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driving tests brought closer to home with partnership deal</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Driving tests could soon be available from branches of Halfords under plans announced by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as using traditional driving test centres, the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) is looking at working with public and private sector partners to provide driving test premises in selected areas that don’t already have a local test centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; began exploring a new approach to test delivery last year, offering tests from premises such as local authority buildings and leisure centres. In March this year the agency announced plans to extend the scheme to 21 more locations, and invited proposals from businesses and other organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; has now selected Halfords plc as a preferred partner, and is also exploring partnerships with the Fire and Rescue Service and several universities. In one location the agency also expects to sign an agreement with training company Mantra Learning Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partners will allow the use of their premises at no cost to &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;, and tests will continue to be conducted by &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; examiners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Penning, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is vital that public services are as open and accessible as possible. This initiative is a great example of how working with partners in the public and private sectors can help to ensure that we offer people the best possible service wherever they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our aim is to provide all driving test candidates with a local service that is convenient as well as being cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Wild, Halfords CEO, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We want to help motorists wherever we can, so we look forward to working in partnership with &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to provide a first class service for drivers taking their tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme focuses on 21 locations, centred around 5 different areas across the country (Glasgow, Kettering, Manchester, Watford and Worcestershire). Testing from partner premises in these locations is expected to start from the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arrangements apply to practical car tests; other types of test and theory test centres will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New powers to protect learner drivers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Driving instructors who pose a major threat to public safety face immediate suspension under new legislation put forward in Parliament.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the current legislation, it takes a minimum of 45 days to prevent an instructor from continuing to give paid driving instruction. However, from 13 July, the Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors will have the power to immediately suspend the registration or trainee licence of an instructor who presents a significant danger to the safety of the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Driving instructors play a vital role in helping to ensure Britain’s roads remain among the safest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of instructors meet the extremely high standards we require of them, but in the very rare cases where an instructor presents a significant danger to the public, it is right that we take prompt and effective action to protect learners and other road users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The registrar is likely to exercise the suspension power in cases where instructors have been convicted of a violent or sexual offence or are delivering tuition of a dangerously low standard, while the formal removal or revocation processes are being completed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="right-of-appeal"&gt;Right of appeal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructors retain the right of appeal against a decision to remove them from the register of approved driving instructors or to revoke their trainee licence. The instructor will be able to apply for compensation in respect of the period of suspension if they are not subsequently removed from the register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bydd hyfforddwyr gyrru sy’n cyflwyno bygythiad arwyddocaol i ddiogelwch y cyhoedd yn wynebu ataliad dros dro ar unwaith dan ddeddfwriaeth newydd i ddiogelu gyrwyr sy’n dysgu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan y ddeddfwriaeth bresennol, mae’n cymryd lleiafswm o 45 diwrnod i atal hyfforddwr rhag parhau i roi gwersi gyrru am dal. Fodd bynnag, o 13 Gorffennaf, bydd gan y Cofrestrydd o Hyfforddwyr Gyrru Cymeradwy y pÅµer i atal cofrestriad neu drwydded dan hyfforddiant hyfforddwr sy’n cyflwyno bygythiad arwyddocaol i ddiogelwch y cyhoedd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meddai’r Gweinidog Diogelwch ar y Ffyrdd Mike Penning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mae hyfforddwyr gyrru’n chwarae rol allweddol wrth helpu sicrhau bod ffyrdd Prydain yn aros ymhlith y rhai diogelaf yn y byd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mae’r mwyafrif mawr o hyfforddwyr yn cwrdd a’r safonau eithriadol o uchel rydym yn gofyn ganddynt, ond yn yr achosion prin iawn ble mae hyfforddwr yn cyflwyno bygythiad arwyddocaol i’r cyhoedd, mae’n gywir inni weithredu’n gyflym ac effeithiol i ddiogelu dysgwyr a defnyddwyr eraill y ffyrdd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mae’r Gofrestrydd yn debygol o ddefnyddio’r pÅµer i atal mewn achosion ble euogfarnwyd hyfforddwyr am dramgwydd treisgar neu rywiol neu ble maent yn cyflwyno hyfforddiant o safon beryglus o isel, tra bod y prosesau tynnu neu ddiddymu ffurfiol yn cael eu cwblhau. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mae hyfforddwyr yn cadw’r hawl i apelio yn erbyn penderfyniad i’w tynnu o’r Gofrestr o Hyfforddwyr Gyrru Cymeradwy neu i ddiddymu eu trwydded dan hyfforddiant. Bydd yr hyfforddwr yn gallu gwneud cais am iawndal ynghylch cyfnod yr ataliad os nas symudir o’r Gofrestr yn y man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Highway Code app launched to improve road safety</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Highway Code is undergoing a digital revolution as Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, launches an interactive app for smartphones.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Britain’s most iconic publications is undergoing a digital revolution today as Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, marks the Highway Code’s 81st year by launching it as an interactive app for smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best-seller’s technological transformation will make it even easier - and more fun - for road users to keep up to date with the rules of the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the Highway Code’s content has changed considerably since its launch in 1931. For example mirrors were not even mentioned in the first edition and drivers were advised to sound their horn when overtaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How road users access its content has also moved with the times. It is already free to read online, can be downloaded as an ebook and there are also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/HighwayCodeGB"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.twitter.com/HighwayCodeGB"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; accounts offering regular topical reminders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a new app for the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch will make it even easier to keep up to date with the rules of the road through a more intuitive, interactive format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With more and more of us using smartphones and other devices it’s vital that products like the Highway Code adapt to be as accessible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The app makes it easier for everyone to keep their knowledge up to date and is a great example of how new technology can help to improve road safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Highway Code has been helping to save lives for more than 80 years and, with innovations like this, I am confident it will do so for many more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new app includes the complete contents of the Highway Code with a search facility making it easy to find rules and information. There are also interactive features like quizzes, a stopping distance calculator and a tool to help users identify road signs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Official Highway Code app is available on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/official-highway-code/id522687241?mt=8"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; for £3.99. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other official Highway Code publications visit the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1207776"&gt;TSO website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highway Code is free to view online at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/highwaycode"&gt;direct.gov.uk/highwaycode.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local partnership ensures driving test service in Angus continues</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Driving tests will continue to be available in Arbroath and Forfar following an agreement to offer tests from 2 local supermarkets.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leases on the existing driving test centres in Arbroath and Forfar expire this month, and testing was originally expected to move to the test centre in Dundee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) has reached an agreement to provide tests from the Asda supermarkets in Arbroath and Forfar, ensuring that candidates will continue to benefit from a convenient, local service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement in Arbroath and Forfar reflects a wider strategy to offer more local services for driving test candidates. In areas without a local test centre where there is sufficient demand for tests, &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; is looking at offering tests from alternative premises such as local authority buildings or retail outlets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that we can continue to provide a local service for driving test candidates in Angus. We have worked very closely with the MP for Angus, Mike Weir, and with the local community on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live. Our aim is to offer a local service that is convenient for candidates as well as being cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Hallyburton, store manager at Asda Forfar, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted to be able to support this strategy, which gives space for candidates to carry out their driving tests in their local area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hopefully we will see many people pass with flying colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing will be conducted from the Asda supermarket in Forfar from 15 May, and in Arbroath from 28 May. Testing in both locations will operate 2 to 3 days per week, in line with the current arrangements. All tests will continue to be conducted by &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; examiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New online service for bus and lorry drivers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A new online driver enquiry service allows drivers to view how many hours of periodic training they have completed towards their Driver CPC.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online driver enquiry service allows drivers to view how many hours of periodic training they have completed towards their Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (&lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt;). Drivers can also give temporary passwords to prospective or current employers, allowing them to confirm how much training drivers have completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standard Agency’s Chief Executive, Rosemary Thew, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt; has been developed to raise and maintain the knowledge and skills of lorry, bus and coach drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new online driver enquiry service will allow professional drivers to check that their training has been uploaded and allow employers to see that this crucial training is taking place - helping the passenger transport and road haulage industries to maintain high professional standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service provides a ‘one stop shop’ to access clear, simple and up to date information. The enquiry screen shows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt; qualification expiry date (bus and coach and/or lorry)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;details of each training course completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online driver enquiry service can be accessed 24 hours-a-day via &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/checkdrivercpc"&gt;direct.gov.uk/checkdrivercpc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Driving tests return to Southend</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Driving test candidates in Southend-on-Sea benefit from a better local service as DSA brings practical driving tests back to the town.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former driving test centre in Southend closed in 2008 when a new test centre opened in Basildon, but from 14 May &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; will begin testing from the Tickfield Community Centre on Southend’s Tickfield Industrial Estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move is part of a strategy to offer a more local service for driving test candidates. In areas without a local test centre where there is sufficient demand for tests, &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; is looking at offering tests on a part time basis from flexible premises such as community centres and other local authority buildings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that driving tests will be returning to Southend and we have worked very closely with the local community on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live. Our aim is to offer a local service that is convenient for candidates as well as being cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests in Southend will initially be available 2 days a week on a Monday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Safety improvements for motorcyclists and lorry and bus drivers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Measures to boost safety for motorcyclists and lorry and bus drivers have been put forward in Parliament.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures - which also strengthen requirements for driving examiners and impact on the rules for drivers towing trailers - will come in to force on 19 January 2013 as part of new European requirements aimed at improving road safety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes are being implemented by the Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;) in conjunction with the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main aspects of the new rules are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="motorcyclists"&gt;Motorcyclists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to more powerful bikes will be staged subject to competence, age and previous experience. The minimum age to ride the largest bikes without previous experience will rise from 21 to 24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="licence-renewals-for-bus-and-lorry-drivers"&gt;Licence renewals for bus and lorry drivers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, drivers of medium-sized and large buses and lorries need to renew their licences every 5 years once they reach the age of 45. Over 45s also need to demonstrate their fitness to drive through a full medical report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2013, all new or renewed bus and lorry licences will be renewable every 5 years. However, drivers under 45 will not require a full medical report and will still only need to renew their photograph every 10 years. All other drivers and riders will continue to renew their driving licences every 10 years as is currently the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="driving-examiners"&gt;Driving examiners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compulsory initial qualification, periodic training and quality assurance checks will be required for driving examiners. Britain already fulfils most of these requirements but the new rules will enhance the &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s existing arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="trailer-towing"&gt;Trailer towing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new rules car drivers will be limited to towing 3.5 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; Chief Executive, Rosemary Thew, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Britain already has some of the safest roads in the world. These changes build on our existing standards and recognise the importance of our examiners’ professionalism. They will also help to ensure that new motorcyclists gain the right skills and experience before riding bigger bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; Chief Executive, Simon Tse, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These changes will provide a useful additional reminder for bus and lorry drivers. They will help to ensure that drivers of these vehicles will continue to operate to high levels of levels of safety by ensuring that they are fit to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European requirements are being introduced in Great Britain in line with feedback from a public consultation, which included responses from driver and rider training bodies, trade associations and road safety groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full details about the changes can be found at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/driving"&gt;direct.gov.uk/driving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>More driving test candidates to benefit from better local services</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Driving test candidates are set to benefit from a more convenient service as a trial exploring a new approach to test delivery is extended.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as using conventional driving test centres, the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) has been looking at whether practical driving tests can be delivered from other venues such as local authority buildings, hotels or leisure centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new approach is currently being trialed at 8 locations, and following positive feedback from candidates and instructors, &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; now plans to extend the scheme to 5 more areas across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live and I am delighted that these first trials have proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are now extending the trial so that more candidates will be able to benefit from a service that is convenient as well as being cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; plans to further develop this model and extend the scheme across areas in and surrounding: Watford, Manchester, Kettering, Glasgow and Worcester. In each area, &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; will look to identify a number of locations where there is sufficient demand for local test provision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests could be provided from local authority buildings, or from local businesses such as hotels or retail outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the longer term planning for driving test delivery, &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; is looking for opportunities to work in partnership with the private sector across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests will still be conducted by &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; examiners, but the agency is inviting businesses who may be interested in providing premises for delivering driving tests to register their interest. A Prior Information Notice is being published in the Official Journal of the European Union and the agency hopes to attract interest from a wide section of the business community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
