    <title>History of the Ministry of Defence</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is a relatively young organisation - it has only existed in its present form since 1971 - but its predecessors go back to the times of Henry VII in the 16th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="origins"&gt;Origins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the MOD can seem complex and confusing is partly attributable to the variety of tasks we undertake, but another reason lies in the Department’s origins. Today’s MOD is a fusion of old ministries: from 1946 to 1964 there were five Departments of State doing what the unified MOD does now: the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry, the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Defence itself. In 1964 the first three and the MOD were amalgamated, and the defence functions of the Ministry of Aviation Supply (as it had by then become) were absorbed in 1971, when the MOD took over responsibility for supplying military aircraft and guided weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-admiralty"&gt;The Admiralty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest of these Departments was the Admiralty, responsible for the Navy. In 1546 Henry VIII created a Navy Board to oversee the administrative affairs of the naval service; policy direction, operational control and maritime jurisdiction remained in the hands of the Lord High Admiral. From 1628 this post was more often than not filled by a “committee” of Lords Commissioners - the Board of Admiralty, whose head was the First Lord, the Minister who was the political master of the Navy. For 200 years the Navy was run by these two Boards, under a system devised largely by Samuel Pepys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisation served well enough during the wars with the Spanish, Dutch and French, but relations between the two Boards were not always harmonious. In 1832 a reforming First Lord abolished the Navy Board, bringing its functions under the superintendence of “Their Lordships” - the Board of Admiralty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the eighteenth century the Department moved to the building in Whitehall still called the Old Admiralty. The Admiralty Board continues to hold meetings in the historic Boardroom in the Old Admiralty Building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-war-office"&gt;The War Office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The War Office, responsible for the Army, was originally the Secretary at War’s office. The first holder of the post was killed in battle - at sea - against the Dutch in 1666. It was not at first a big spending Department; office expenses for six months of 1673 amounted to £14 9s 0d. It became however of increasing importance in the political control of the Army, although it was not the only Government Department involved - in 1815 there were fifteen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not an efficient system, and finally in 1854 the War Office was set up to take over all political and financial control of the Army. Even that was not a complete success. Florence Nightingale, who was a friend of the Secretary of State and very interested in the cause of military reform after her experiences during the Crimean War, wrote to him in 1859, describing the War Office as “a very slow office, an enormously expensive office, a not very efficient office”. After many years of gradual change the War Office was finally reformed in 1904 on the lines of the Board of Admiralty, with the Secretary of State chairing the Army Council, and a new office for it was built in Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-air-ministry"&gt;The Air Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Ministry was created in January 1918 to oversee the birth in April 1918 of the Royal Air Force from the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. The organisation was broadly similar to that of the Admiralty and the War Office, with a Secretary of State chairing the Air Council and the senior RAF member holding the post of Chief of the Air Staff. In 1919 the Air Ministry moved to Adastral House, then in Kingsway. In 1952 the central part of the Air Ministry moved to the new building in Whitehall Gardens that was later to become the Main Building of the Ministry of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-procurement-executive"&gt;The Procurement Executive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply of military aircraft, which had been the responsibility of the Air Ministry, was transferred in 1940 to a new Ministry of Aircraft Production, which in 1946 was amalgamated with the Ministry of Supply. In further reorganisations the task was switched to the Ministry of Aviation in 1959, to the Ministry of Technology in 1967 and finally to the Ministry of Aviation Supply in 1970. In 1971 the Government called on Mr Derek Rayner to advise on its relations with the aviation industry. One of his principal recommendations was the transfer to the MOD of the military aviation task, to be undertaken by a separate organisation within the MOD, which would also assume the responsibility for all other military procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Procurement Executive was born on 2 August 1971, with Mr (later Lord) Rayner as its first Chief Executive. In 1995, it collocated to the purpose-built Abbey Wood complex in Filton, north Bristol and in 1999 became an Executive Agency of the MOD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Protecting access to space</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report identifies the great extent to which most nations rely upon services that are delivered from space and outlines steps that may be taken to assure their continued availability. It lays out the ‘space problem’, that the space environment around Earth is sensitive to disruption and its use could be relatively easily lost. The nature of the more common orbits is described and highlights some of the space-based capabilities upon which most nations have come to rely.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document goes on to discuss a three phase framework upon which proactive steps for avoiding the loss of space capabilities can be based: before an attack (space deterrence); during an attack (space defence); and after an attack (collaborative) space mitigation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Development Plans for the Lyneham Site consultation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defence Technical Training Change Programme (DTTCP) represents the MOD’s plan for delivering cost effective technical training for military personnel. As part of this, the existing technical training given at Bordon and Arborfield will be transferred to the Lyneham site by the end of 2015, following its planned closure as an RAF unit at the end of 2012. The site will be developed to meet the requirements of the training college before technical training commences.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-proposals"&gt;The proposals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed new development is designed to create a new Defence College of Technical Training at the Lyneham site, comprising of the following principal training schools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic and Mechanical Engineering (EME) – This will provide trade training for mechanics, engineers, technicians and technical support specialists for land and maritime specialisations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aeronautical Engineering (AE) –This will involve providing training for avionics and aircraft technicians.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communications and Information Systems (CIS) - This will involve field-based tactical training and classroom/workshop based technical training in communications and information systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general terms, Service personnel under training at the DCTT learn to maintain machinery and keep military equipment running.  This involves utilisation of training workshops, classrooms and laboratories, with students working on simulated and real machines and vehicles. There will also be outdoor training covering skills such as recovering overturned vehicles. New and refurbished accommodation will be provided along with physical education, sports and welfare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-dates"&gt;Key dates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal assessment phase commences – August 2012&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planned closure of RAF Lyneham – December 2012&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit planning application – Mid 2013&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start of construction on Tranche 1 – January 2014&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;End of construction on Tranche 1 – End of 2015&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving in / training – End of 2015&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The long-term goal is to move more MOD Technical Training Units into Lyneham, in a series of tranches that stretch beyond 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-contact-us"&gt;How to contact us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have prepared &lt;a rel="external" href="http://surveys.defenceconsultations.org.uk/limesurvey/index.php?sid=69322&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;a questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; to gain initial feedback on the proposal from local residents and other interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="consultation-events"&gt;Consultation events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is planned that public exhibitions will be held in Spring 2013 when draft plans for the redevelopment of Lyneham Site will be presented at a series of Defence Infrastructure Organisation drop in sessions. We will provide further details of these events as they become available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, in addition to updates on this website, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation will continue to provide regular briefings to the Royal Wootton Bassett and Cricklade Area Board and Lyneham and Bradenstoke Parish Council throughout the duration of the project. We will also continue to engage with the Lyneham Steering Group on day to day issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions the team can be contacted by email or in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leaflet providing more information about the Defence Technical Training Change Programme Infrastructure is available to download below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
