    <title>Channel Tunnel: transposition of railway safety and interoperability directives</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently seeking views on whether to transpose the requirements of 3 European directives on railway safety and interoperability so that these provisions are in force for the Channel Tunnel. In recognition of the Tunnel’s cross-border nature these we would like to incorporate the provisions of these railway safety and interoperability directives by making amendments to the Channel Tunnel (Safety) Order 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Annual bus statistics: 2011-12</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the data are derived from the Department’s main annual survey of bus and coach operators. Information on revenue, costs and government support for buses will be added on 13 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome any feedback on these statistics by email to &lt;a href="mailto:bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="passenger-journeys"&gt;Passenger journeys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 5.2 billion bus passenger journeys in Great Britain in 2011/12, a slight (0.6%) increase on the previous year, with 4.7 billion of these journeys in England.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 2011/12 figures broadly show a continuation of recent trends, with patronage increasing in London and the south of England but falling elsewhere. Journeys in London now account for half of all bus passenger journeys in England.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="vehicle-miles"&gt;Vehicle miles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bus vehicle miles in Great Britain fell slightly, by 1.3% between 2010/11 and 2011/12 with a 0.8% fall in England.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mileage on services financially supported by local authorities in England outside London fell by 9% over the same period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="vehicles-and-staff"&gt;Vehicles and staff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local bus operators in Great Britain operated 42 thousand buses and employed 124 thousand staff in 2011/12. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proportion of buses which are disability accessible or low floor designs continues to increase steadily, to 88% in 2011/12.  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Concessionary Travel Statistics: England, 2011-12 and 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents information on concessionary travel on buses in England during 2011/12 and 2012/13. The main focus of the release is free bus travel for older and disabled people, but it also includes information relating to concessions on other transport modes and young people’s concessions. Most of the data are derived from the Department for Transport’s survey of Travel Concession Authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome any feedback on these statistics via email to &lt;a href="mailto:bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="planned-update"&gt;Planned update:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional data relating to total expenditure on concessionary travel will be released later in November, as soon as the latest data is available from the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-points"&gt;Key points:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011/12, there were around 9.8m older and disabled concessionary bus passes in England, with an average of 109 bus journeys per pass per year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pass numbers in England are forecast to increase by 3% in 2012/13, according to forecasts by Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel concession authorities (TCAs) paid £898m in 2011/12 to reimburse bus operators for concessionary journeys by older and disabled people, a fall of 2% in real terms since 2010/11. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average reimbursement per concessionary journey in 2011/12 was 84 pence, a fall of 3 pence per journey in real terms, compared to 2010/11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, 87 of the 89 travel concession authorities (TCAs) outside London offer some discretionary travel concessions, most commonly concessions for companions to disabled people and extensions to the statutory travel time period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, in all but 5 TCAs in England, some travel concession is available for young people, offered by either the TCA or on a commercial basis by bus operators. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Removal of motor insurance certificates</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on amending the Road Traffic Act 1988 to remove the need for insurers to issue a motor insurance certificate when an insurance policy is taken out. At present the certificate is used as evidence of valid insurance cover and there are circumstances when it must be produced by the insured to demonstrate they have valid cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers are required by law to enter details of all motor insurance policies onto the motor insurance database (&lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt;). This consultation document considers using the &lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt; as the single source for checking if insurance cover is in place and considers what further changes and developments are needed to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Aviation permits</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-permit-regime-explained"&gt;The permit regime explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before operating to, from or within the United Kingdom, all foreign registered aircraft must be in possession of an operating permit issued by the Department for Transport’s International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division (&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt;) under the 2009 Air Navigation Order. This requirement extends to all scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo charters that are not covered by the provisions of the European market access regulations, and to flights carrying out aerial work (e.g. photography, parachuting, flight training). Foreign aircraft require also permits under the appropriate air navigation orders before operating to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and the UK overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before granting any operating permits for scheduled flights, &lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; ensures that the services are operating in conformity with the traffic rights and conditions provided under the UK’s bilateral air services arrangements negotiated with the airlines’ states. In the case of non-scheduled flights we seek reciprocity to ensure that UK airlines are allowed similar opportunities from the respective foreign authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; also ensures that a number of administrative arrangements are completed before an operating permit is granted. These require airlines to provide valid certificates that are recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on competency (ie air operators certificate), insurance, registration, aircraft airworthiness and noise and that aircraft are fitted with a recognised enhanced ground proximity warning system, airborne collision avoidance system and crews are aware of the UK Approach Ban requirements and comply with aerodrome operating minima requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, any airline operating aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of 10,000kgs or more in the United Kingdom must also have a security Direction (known as the Single Consolidated Direction (Aviation) 2010) served on them and so applicants applying for a permit that involves such an operation should also contact &lt;a href="mailto:surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="departmental-contacts"&gt;Departmental contacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to the Secretary of State for airline operating permits should be sent using the appropriate form to the Department for Transport at the address below at least 48 hours in advance of the first flight:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maritime Statistics Directive reporting guidance</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help for shipping lines, their agents and ports to complete statistical returns on maritime freight traffic through ports, as required by the European Commission Maritime Statistics Directive (95/64/EU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules and code lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-submission-methods/"&gt;submission methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-faqs/"&gt;frequently asked questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-maritime-statistics-directive"&gt;What is the Maritime Statistics Directive?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maritime Statistics Directive is a piece of European Union legislation passed in December 1995 &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;amp;lg=EN&amp;amp;numdoc=31995L0064"&gt;Council Directive 96/64/EC&lt;/a&gt; which requires Member States to supply to the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) information relating to maritime traffic through its’ ports. The UK has been required to report data under the Directive since 1 January 2000. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:141:0029:0047:EN:PDF"&gt;directive was ‘recast’&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, bringing together the original directive and various subsequent amendments in one document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="is-the-provision-of-data-obligatory"&gt;Is the provision of data obligatory?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. The directive requires the government to make collection obligatory in the United Kingdom. The legal powers in the UK are by means of a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2330/contents/made"&gt;statutory instrument&lt;/a&gt; under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. The statutory instrument (number 2330 of 1997) obliges all relevant bodies in the transport industry to provide data to &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; for onward transmission to Eurostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-has-to-provide-the-data"&gt;Who has to provide the data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the statutory instrument requires all relevant transport organisations to provide the data, the detailed data has to be provided by the shipping lines or their agents for freight movements through major UK ports (i.e. those handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum). In addition, port authorities at major ports have to provide quarterly aggregated data to confirm the completeness of the data collected from shipping lines/agents.
At minor ports (those handling less than 1 million tonnes) only annual aggregate figures are required from port authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-are-the-data-collected"&gt;Why are the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collected under the directive are used by the European Commission to assist in policy development at a European level and to monitor the impact of European policy measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the UK government has collected statistics on port traffic in the UK since longer before the Directive came in. These have been used by government, business and the wider public in developing and debating maritime transport policy and in planning operations and new ventures. The effect of the Directive was to change the detail of what was already collected in the UK and introduce much more consistency in European port statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-is-responsible-for-ensuring-collection-of-data-in-the-uk"&gt;Who is responsible for ensuring collection of data in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government department with overall responsibility for the data collection is the Department for Transport, (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;). It employs a collection agent, BMT Reliability consultants, to carry out the day-to-day operation of the data collection activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-results-from-the-data-collected"&gt;Where can I find the results from the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport publishes UK data. Eurostat publishes &lt;a rel="external" href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home"&gt;Europe-wide data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-data-has-to-be-collected-and-how-often"&gt;What data has to be collected and how often?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Directive requires the collection of statistics on freight traffic, vessels and passenger traffic through ports throughout the European Union. The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has the means to collect data on vessels and passenger traffic separately, so the system described here relates to the requirements for freight traffic only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data relating to freight traffic is only being collected in detail for UK ports handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum (‘major ports’). This detailed data includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Lloyds Register Number (or IMO Number) for the vessel (or name, flag and deadweight);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the direction of movement (inwards or outwards);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;port of loading for inwards cargo or unloading for outwards cargo;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for unitised traffic the type of units (container, accompanied trailer, unaccompanied trailer etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether they are loaded or empty units;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of units and the freight tonnage;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for other traffic, the broad product group and freight tonnage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data has to be provided at least quarterly and is being collected primarily from shipping lines or their agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ‘major’ port authorities (where traffic exceeds one million tonnes per annum) are providing the following information on a ‘retrospective’ quarterly basis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the names of all shipping lines and agents using their port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the identity of all vessels using their port; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the gross weight and number of units of goods in and out of their port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for other ports, handling less than one million tonnes a year, is being provided only annually in summary form by port authorities. 
For more see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-are-the-data-collected-in-the-uk"&gt;How are the data collected in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These range of options are available by which data providers can supply the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by sending the data automatically via a Port Community System&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by entering the data through web based forms (iSDES)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by submitting ASCII data files in a &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; approved format&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by completing paper forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection agency provide a central database to collect and store the data received by these methods, ready for transmission to &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-submission-methods/"&gt;submission methods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Statement of administrative sources for official statistics published by the Department for Transport</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official statistics published by the Department for Transport are based on 2 main sources – data gathered from statistical surveys, and data extracted from administrative or management systems. This statement sets out the Department for Transport’s approach to the use of administrative sources for statistical purposes, as required by Protocol 3 of the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of administrative sources are currently used by the Department for Transport statistical teams to compile official statistics. In all cases where such sources are used, professional statisticians are involved in quality assuring the use of the data for statistical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using data which are already available within administrative or management systems, rather than collecting data afresh, we are able to limit the overall burden placed on data providers, and also avoid the costs of mounting dedicated data collection exercises. In addition, the information we extract from such systems often has the advantage of being more timely than statistical data and, when compared with data from surveys (and particularly sample surveys), can also deliver data with a greater breadth of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of our use of administrative systems include data from the Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;) to produce Vehicle Registration and Licensing Statistics, and by taking a sample of vehicles from &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt; records to produce statistics for road freight statistics. Estimates of vehicle excise duty evasion are also produced using the administrative data held by the &lt;abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"&gt;DVLA&lt;/abbr&gt;. We use the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) Seafarer Documentation System as an input to UK Seafarer Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Statistics Authority actively encourages public bodies to exploit administrative and management sources for statistical purposes. However the Authority recognises that the statistical advantages of such arrangements can only be fully realised if statisticians have appropriate access to such systems; if statistical purposes are reflected in the design, management, and development of such systems; and if adequate safeguards are put in place to ensure the professional integrity of any official statistics derived from them. The Authority‘s main requirements are set out in the third Protocol attached to their Code of Practice for Official Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The Standing Committee on Road Accident Statistics (&lt;abbr title="Standing Committee on Road Accident Statistics"&gt;SCRAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) was set up in 1977 to oversee the new STATS19 process for road accident data collection. It was given the following terms of reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to consider problems arising in the collection of data on road accidents and make recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to disseminate information on techniques and procedures developed in connection with the system of accident reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to consider any amendments to the system that may be required and make recommendations at the time of the quinquennial review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Standing Committee on Road Accident Statistics"&gt;SCRAS&lt;/abbr&gt; has continued to steer the process of accident data collection since then - particularly dealing with the quinquennial reviews of the survey. The membership of the committee is drawn from a wide range of bodies and includes representatives of central government, local government and the police. The committee is chaired by &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;. A full list of members and the bodies they represent is given in the &lt;abbr title="Standing Committee on Road Accident Statistics"&gt;SCRAS&lt;/abbr&gt; newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Heavy goods vehicle speed limit increase evaluation: final report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) to provide an evidence-base, analysis and reasoned opinion on whether or not there is likely to be any road safety risk involved in increasing the speed limit of heavy good vehicles exceeding 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway de-restricted roads from 40mph to 50mph (or possibly 45mph). This report gives detail on the findings of the research.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Examining the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum speed limit for heavy goods vehicles (&lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;) over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads is prescribed in Schedule 6 of the Road Traffic Act 1984. The current speed limit on single carriageways for &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; over 7.5 tonnes is 40 miles per hour. The speed limit for smaller &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; (those between 3.5 tonnes and 7.5 tonnes) is 50 mph. The government made a commitment in ‘The logistics growth review – connecting people with goods’ document published in November 2011, to consult on this issue during 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders have said that the 40 mph speed limit causes unnecessary cost to vehicle operators, congestion, avoidable overtaking accidents and creates an uneven playing field for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freight and logistics sector is an essential part of the economy, vital to businesses of all sizes and sectors. Raising &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; speed limits on single carriageway roads could lead to quicker journeys and lower costs for the sector, aiding economic growth as well as reducing frustration for the many drivers who find themselves stuck behind slower-moving lorries on busy roads unable to overtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are other consequences of greater speed – both in terms of the environmental impacts and the potential effects on road safety. The department wants to make sure we have carefully considered the evidence of all of the effects on the economy, environment and road safety before any decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;
