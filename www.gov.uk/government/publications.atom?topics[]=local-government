    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local Sustainable Transport Fund</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Transport White Paper Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon, published in January 2011, placed localism at the heart of the transport agenda in order to cut carbon emissions and create local growth. A total of £560 million was originally made available through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund to enable the Department to fund a number of high quality bids. Funding was topped up with a further £40 million to £600 million in 2012 to accommodate approval for a greater number of bids (with match funding being provided by local authority partners). In total, DfT awarded funding to 96 packages to 77 authorities to deliver their schemes between 2011 and 2015. Along with local contributions provided by all funded project teams, over £1 billion is now being invested in local sustainable travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding announcements made were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 September 2012, Ministers approved just under £5 million to Tyne and Wear ITA for a small project, based on the strongest elements of their Large Project proposal (which was turned down for funding in June 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;27 June 2012, Ministers awarded £225 million to 12 large projects (above £5 million), plus £41 million to 14 tranche 2 projects (small projects up to £5 million)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;24 May 2012, Ministers awarded £113 million to 30 tranche 2 projects (small projects up to £5 million)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 July 2011, Ministers awarded £155 million to 39 tranche 1 projects (small projects up to £5 million)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Sustainable Transport Fund bidding rounds are now closed and the fund is fully committed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Improving local government transparency</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of the ‘Code of recommended practice for local authorities on Data Transparency’ in September 2011, ministers would now like to make the code a legal requirement via regulations, subject to consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to enforce the code through regulations via the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/65/contents" title="Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980"&gt;Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980&lt;/a&gt;, Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers wish to hear from all those local authorities listed in paragraph 4 of the code. They would also like to hear from relevant bodies, open data experts, developers, citizen activists and other interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Localising support for Council Tax: transitional grant scheme</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government is making available an additional £100 million for 1 year to support those local authorities in developing well-designed council tax support schemes and maintain positive incentives to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grant will be payable in March 2013 to those authorities who adopt schemes that must comply with criteria set by Government to ensure that low income households do not face an extensive increase in their council tax liability in 2013-14. This funding will enable councils to explore more sustainable approaches to managing the funding reduction that minimise the impact on vulnerable taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Accountability system statement for the Greater London Authority</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This document sets out the financial accountability system for the Greater London Authority. It has been signed off by Sir Bob Kerslake as accounting officer for the Department for Communities and Local Government. It sets out the financial relationship between the Greater London Authority and the Department and sets out the checks and balances including via the elected London Assembly and through various statutory controls which forms the system at present. The statement also signposts changes which are expected to be made during the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Statement is a sister document to the System Accountability Statement for Local Government published in March 2012. Owing to the unique governance arrangements in the capital, with a strong executive Mayor and elected Assembly, the funding streams and accountability systems are sufficiently different to warrant a bespoke Accountability System Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local Government Pension Scheme Funds for England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the Local Government Pension Scheme in England in 2011-12 were announced on 17 October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2007-08 to 2011-12 and updates those statistics previously released on 12 October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local Government Pension Scheme expenditure on benefits in 2011-12 was £7.5xbillion, compared with £6.7 billion in 2010-11, an increase of 12 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income from employees’ contributions to the Local Government Pension Scheme in 2011-12 was £1.8 billion, a decrease on 2010-11 of more than 6 per cent. Income from employers’ contributions to the scheme in the same period also decreased, albeit by just 0.4 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, total expenditure accounted for 74 per cent of the Local Government Pension Scheme income, up from 58 per cent in 2007-08.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income from investments rose by 13 per cent on 2010-11 to £3.0 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The market value of the funds at end of March 2012 was £148 billion. This represents an increase of 4 per cent on March 2011 and an increase of 52 per cent on March 2009.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were less than 1.6 million employees in the Local Government Pension Scheme at the end of March 2012, a 66 thousand, or 4 per cent, decrease over the figure for March 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of people leaving the Local Government Pension Scheme in 2011-12 because of redundancy was more than 27,400, an increase of more than 55 per cent over the 2010-11 figure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of former employees entitled to deferred benefits rose to 1.4 million in 2011-12, an increase of 7 per cent over 2010-11 and an increase of 35 per cent over 2007-08.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="dft-business-plan-other-key-data"&gt;DfT Business Plan other key data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographical coverage: England&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information broken down by: Region - data are available for London, English metropolitan areas (as a group), and English non-metropolitan areas (as a group)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="latest-data"&gt;Latest data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In quarter 2 (April-June) 2012, there were 1.15 billion passenger journeys on local buses in England.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recent data table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://charts.dft.gov.uk/dft-business-plan/indicators/#10"&gt;Click here to view this data in an interactive chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Quarter&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Passenger journey (billions)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/12 Apr - Jun&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.150&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/13 Apr-Jun&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.149&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Percentage change&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bus passenger journeys in England increased by around 15% between 2004/05 and 2008/09, a period in which the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme was introduced. Growth was greater in London, with a smaller increase in the metropolitan areas outside London over this period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since 2008/09, passenger journeys have remained broadly flat, with continued growth in London offsetting a gradual decline in passenger numbers outside London&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Though figures for individual quarters should be interpreted with caution, the April to June 2012 figures show a fall in seasonally adjusted journeys of 2% for England compared with the previous quarter, with falls in London, metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background-information"&gt;Background information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarterly estimates are based on a panel of the 18 largest non-metropolitan operators, Passenger Transport Executives (for metropolitan areas) and Transport for London (TfL). The panel covers over 90% of the journeys made in Great Britain. Data from the quarterly panel is scaled to annual figures from the Department’s main annual survey of 700 PSV operators, and figures are then seasonally adjusted. More information is in the Guidance Notes (see link in Related Information below)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The quarterly figures are less precise than the annual statistics which aim to report on all journeys, including those covered by smaller operators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quarterly figures are subject to revision due to the nature of the seasonal adjustment, and scaling to annual figures. However, these will typically be minor and not affect overall patterns shown&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over £250 transparency spending data is taken from SAP’s general ledger payment transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As required by HM Treasury, the data relates to accounts payable payments and credit note transactions for grants and procurement expenditure, recorded at the time the transaction was processed on SAP. The data excludes any subsequent journal transactions and accounts receivable receipts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel, subsistence and other employee transactions - these are currently published on a summarised anonomised basis. They are summarised by ‘Expense area’, then ‘Expense type’, by day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The terms ‘localism’ and ‘neighbourhoods’ in the spreadsheets refer to groups within DCLG. They cover policy areas such as housing, planning and local government.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data is published in CSV and Excel formats in payment date sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Operation of traffic signals during low demand periods</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic signal design is a science that has been developed through decades to a point where the maximum efficiency can be squeezed out of the most congested of junctions. Conflicting needs of all road users are measured, evaluated and optimised such that the ever-increasing and varying demands continue to be managed with ingenuity and perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But roads aren’t always busy. In many cases the very justification for signal control is based on a problem that may only exist for a couple of hours each weekday. Even the most congested networks have their quiet moment, yet, in a deserted city at three in the morning, signals still cycle for non-existent traffic. Any driver who ventures into this scenario may sit in frustration at a red light while the ‘intelligent’ control system optimises the signals for phantom conflicting demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other countries various techniques are applied to ‘demote’ signalised junctions to priority mode of operation, for example the flashing amber on main road/flashing red on minor road employed in some States of the USA, or signals that simply turn off overnight as in parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport commissioned a desktop study to investigate options for signal controlled installations that could&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce unnecessary delays to traffic, hence minimising overall vehicle delays and emissions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduce the energy consumption of signal installations; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maintain or enhance levels of safety, especially for vulnerable road users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reviewed current practice in the UK and overseas, developed an assessment technique to identify the types of installation that may be suitable for an alternative low-demand strategy during periods of low demand and in liaison with 12 Local Authorities devised 25 potential control strategy options to meet the objectives. These options were then modelled on a small hypothetical VISSIM network, enabling assessment on factors relating to economy, environment, safety, legislation and design, and classified according to their potential for implementation - short, medium or long term - depending upon factors such as required changes to legislation, technology or driver comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings were notable - the options offering most benefit during low demand periods were also the most difficult to implement. However there are opportunities for embracing developing technologies and making minor changes to installation parameters that could reduce installation and maintenance costs and improve the efficiency of low demand methods of operation that retain signal control and its intrinsic safety compared with priority operation. The outcome of the research commissioned by the Department for Transport on options for signalling in periods of low demand are presented in this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local authority borrowing and investments 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Local Authority Borrowing and Investments statistics produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government were released on Thursday 13 September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total gross borrowing of the local government sector rose 16 per cent in the past year from £70.6bn to £81.8bn at the end of 2011-12. This represented a 33 per cent increase over five years from £61.4bn at the end of 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;excluding the one-off Housing Revenue Account (HRA) settlement of a net £8.1bn, total borrowing would have been £73.7bn at the end of 2011-12, a 5 per cent increase from 2010-11 and 20 per cent since 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99 per cent of borrowing is longer-term; of this longer-term borrowing 75 per cent was with the Public Works Loan Board&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;total investments rose from £25.1bn at the end of 2010-11 to £26.1bn at the end of 2011-12, an increase of 4 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as at 31 March 2012, 62 per cent of all investments were with banks and building societies, a decrease from 69 per cent at 31 March 2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Technical reforms to Council Tax: when dwellings should not be liable to the empty homes premium</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Finance Bill includes provisions that will allow a billing authority to charge an empty homes premium to provide a stronger incentive to get homes back into productive use and remove the blight of such properties on local neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium was subject to a consultation, ‘Technical Reforms to Council Tax’, which ended on 29 December 2011. The government published its response on 28 May 2012, which confirmed its intention to proceed with the premium and stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will not be payable until a dwelling has been empty and unfurnished for 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the maximum premium that an authority will be able to charge will be 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on the government’s proposals on exceptions to the premium: dwellings which may otherwise be liable for the premium, but which are subject to circumstances that mean that it would not be appropriate for it to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>DCLG business plan quarterly indicators: September 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tables show the latest figures for the input and impact indicators set out in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; Business Plan 2012 to 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government has adopted these indicators to help the public assess the effects of policies and reforms on the cost and impact of public services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individual indicators are unique to &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;. This is the first time that the business plan indicators have been published separately from the quarterly summary management data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
