    <title>Improving local government transparency</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of the ‘Code of recommended practice for local authorities on Data Transparency’ in September 2011, ministers would now like to make the code a legal requirement via regulations, subject to consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to enforce the code through regulations via the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/65/contents" title="Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980"&gt;Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980&lt;/a&gt;, Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers wish to hear from all those local authorities listed in paragraph 4 of the code. They would also like to hear from relevant bodies, open data experts, developers, citizen activists and other interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Technical reforms to Council Tax: when dwellings should not be liable to the empty homes premium</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Finance Bill includes provisions that will allow a billing authority to charge an empty homes premium to provide a stronger incentive to get homes back into productive use and remove the blight of such properties on local neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium was subject to a consultation, ‘Technical Reforms to Council Tax’, which ended on 29 December 2011. The government published its response on 28 May 2012, which confirmed its intention to proceed with the premium and stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will not be payable until a dwelling has been empty and unfurnished for 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the maximum premium that an authority will be able to charge will be 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on the government’s proposals on exceptions to the premium: dwellings which may otherwise be liable for the premium, but which are subject to circumstances that mean that it would not be appropriate for it to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

The proposed new code will be underpinned by 7 guiding principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give effect to the government’s commitment to stop unfair competition by local authority newspapers, the proposed new Code now contains specific guidance on the frequency, content and appearance of local authority newspapers or magazines. It also proposes to prohibit the use of lobbyists where the expenditure is intended to influence local people on political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation invites views on the draft consolidation of the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003 and 4 amending instruments, and incorporation of a series of technical amendments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an increase in the threshold below which a body is classed as a smaller body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a revised procedure for the approval and publication of statements of accounts and other accounting statements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;new provision for the accounts of Passenger Transport Executives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the removal of criminal penalties for non-compliance with the regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft also restructures the regulations with the aim of making them easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is part of a regular series of updates to the Accounts and Audit Regulations designed to keep them in line with developments in financial governance, accounting and audit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous updates were made most recently in 2003, 2006, and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Future of local public audit</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 13 August 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced plans to disband the Audit Commission, and refocus audit of local public bodies on helping local people hold those bodies to account for local spending decisions, the very essence of localism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to replace the current, centralised audit systems managed by the Audit Commission, with a new decentralised regime, which will support local democratic accountability, and one that will also cut bureaucracy and costs, while ensuring that there continues to be robust local public audit. This consultation sets out proposals on the new audit framework where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audit quality is regulated within a statutory framework, overseen by the National Audit Office and the accountancy profession&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;local public bodies will be free to appoint their own external auditors with stringent safeguards for independence&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part proposes a rationalised collection of housing data to reduce the burden on local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Proposed policy statement for part 2 of the Localism Act 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation is on a proposed policy statement for Part 2 of the Localism Act 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act provides a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central government and towards local people. The government has given public authorities more powers and freedoms to conduct their business and deliver services to the public. This includes a major reduction in the ‘oversight’ role of central government. Public authorities must, therefore, accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions or omissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of the Localism Act is about incentivising public authorities to comply with European law, in order to avoid any financial sanctions in the first place. The proposed policy statement sets out a fair, proportionate and reasonable approach for the use of Part 2. The statement has been developed with the Local Government Association and the Greater London Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The government is also announcing clarifications to the guidance in relation to local councils and their development plan, and in relation to ensuring evidence submitted at appeal is manifestly accurate and truthful. The government is also requiring the five main statutory bodies to report on, and be accountable for their performance on dealing with planning applications as part of their individual Improvement Plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
