    <title>Removal of motor insurance certificates</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on amending the Road Traffic Act 1988 to remove the need for insurers to issue a motor insurance certificate when an insurance policy is taken out. At present the certificate is used as evidence of valid insurance cover and there are circumstances when it must be produced by the insured to demonstrate they have valid cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers are required by law to enter details of all motor insurance policies onto the motor insurance database (&lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt;). This consultation document considers using the &lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt; as the single source for checking if insurance cover is in place and considers what further changes and developments are needed to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Aviation permits</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-permit-regime-explained"&gt;The permit regime explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before operating to, from or within the United Kingdom, all foreign registered aircraft must be in possession of an operating permit issued by the Department for Transport’s International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division (&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt;) under the 2009 Air Navigation Order. This requirement extends to all scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo charters that are not covered by the provisions of the European market access regulations, and to flights carrying out aerial work (e.g. photography, parachuting, flight training). Foreign aircraft require also permits under the appropriate air navigation orders before operating to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and the UK overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before granting any operating permits for scheduled flights, &lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; ensures that the services are operating in conformity with the traffic rights and conditions provided under the UK’s bilateral air services arrangements negotiated with the airlines’ states. In the case of non-scheduled flights we seek reciprocity to ensure that UK airlines are allowed similar opportunities from the respective foreign authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; also ensures that a number of administrative arrangements are completed before an operating permit is granted. These require airlines to provide valid certificates that are recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on competency (ie air operators certificate), insurance, registration, aircraft airworthiness and noise and that aircraft are fitted with a recognised enhanced ground proximity warning system, airborne collision avoidance system and crews are aware of the UK Approach Ban requirements and comply with aerodrome operating minima requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, any airline operating aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of 10,000kgs or more in the United Kingdom must also have a security Direction (known as the Single Consolidated Direction (Aviation) 2010) served on them and so applicants applying for a permit that involves such an operation should also contact &lt;a href="mailto:surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="departmental-contacts"&gt;Departmental contacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to the Secretary of State for airline operating permits should be sent using the appropriate form to the Department for Transport at the address below at least 48 hours in advance of the first flight:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maritime Statistics Directive reporting guidance</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help for shipping lines, their agents and ports to complete statistical returns on maritime freight traffic through ports, as required by the European Commission Maritime Statistics Directive (95/64/EU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules and code lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-submission-methods/"&gt;submission methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-faqs/"&gt;frequently asked questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-maritime-statistics-directive"&gt;What is the Maritime Statistics Directive?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maritime Statistics Directive is a piece of European Union legislation passed in December 1995 &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;amp;lg=EN&amp;amp;numdoc=31995L0064"&gt;Council Directive 96/64/EC&lt;/a&gt; which requires Member States to supply to the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) information relating to maritime traffic through its’ ports. The UK has been required to report data under the Directive since 1 January 2000. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:141:0029:0047:EN:PDF"&gt;directive was ‘recast’&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, bringing together the original directive and various subsequent amendments in one document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="is-the-provision-of-data-obligatory"&gt;Is the provision of data obligatory?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. The directive requires the government to make collection obligatory in the United Kingdom. The legal powers in the UK are by means of a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2330/contents/made"&gt;statutory instrument&lt;/a&gt; under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. The statutory instrument (number 2330 of 1997) obliges all relevant bodies in the transport industry to provide data to &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; for onward transmission to Eurostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-has-to-provide-the-data"&gt;Who has to provide the data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the statutory instrument requires all relevant transport organisations to provide the data, the detailed data has to be provided by the shipping lines or their agents for freight movements through major UK ports (i.e. those handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum). In addition, port authorities at major ports have to provide quarterly aggregated data to confirm the completeness of the data collected from shipping lines/agents.
At minor ports (those handling less than 1 million tonnes) only annual aggregate figures are required from port authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-are-the-data-collected"&gt;Why are the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collected under the directive are used by the European Commission to assist in policy development at a European level and to monitor the impact of European policy measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the UK government has collected statistics on port traffic in the UK since longer before the Directive came in. These have been used by government, business and the wider public in developing and debating maritime transport policy and in planning operations and new ventures. The effect of the Directive was to change the detail of what was already collected in the UK and introduce much more consistency in European port statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-is-responsible-for-ensuring-collection-of-data-in-the-uk"&gt;Who is responsible for ensuring collection of data in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government department with overall responsibility for the data collection is the Department for Transport, (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;). It employs a collection agent, BMT Reliability consultants, to carry out the day-to-day operation of the data collection activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-results-from-the-data-collected"&gt;Where can I find the results from the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport publishes UK data. Eurostat publishes &lt;a rel="external" href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home"&gt;Europe-wide data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-data-has-to-be-collected-and-how-often"&gt;What data has to be collected and how often?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Directive requires the collection of statistics on freight traffic, vessels and passenger traffic through ports throughout the European Union. The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has the means to collect data on vessels and passenger traffic separately, so the system described here relates to the requirements for freight traffic only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data relating to freight traffic is only being collected in detail for UK ports handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum (‘major ports’). This detailed data includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Lloyds Register Number (or IMO Number) for the vessel (or name, flag and deadweight);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the direction of movement (inwards or outwards);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;port of loading for inwards cargo or unloading for outwards cargo;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for unitised traffic the type of units (container, accompanied trailer, unaccompanied trailer etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether they are loaded or empty units;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of units and the freight tonnage;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for other traffic, the broad product group and freight tonnage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data has to be provided at least quarterly and is being collected primarily from shipping lines or their agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ‘major’ port authorities (where traffic exceeds one million tonnes per annum) are providing the following information on a ‘retrospective’ quarterly basis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the names of all shipping lines and agents using their port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the identity of all vessels using their port; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the gross weight and number of units of goods in and out of their port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for other ports, handling less than one million tonnes a year, is being provided only annually in summary form by port authorities. 
For more see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-are-the-data-collected-in-the-uk"&gt;How are the data collected in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These range of options are available by which data providers can supply the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by sending the data automatically via a Port Community System&lt;/li&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/examining-the-speed-limit-for-heavy-goods-vehicles-over-7-5-tonnes-on-single-carriageway-roads"/>
    <title>Examining the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum speed limit for heavy goods vehicles (&lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;) over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads is prescribed in Schedule 6 of the Road Traffic Act 1984. The current speed limit on single carriageways for &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; over 7.5 tonnes is 40 miles per hour. The speed limit for smaller &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; (those between 3.5 tonnes and 7.5 tonnes) is 50 mph. The government made a commitment in ‘The logistics growth review – connecting people with goods’ document published in November 2011, to consult on this issue during 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders have said that the 40 mph speed limit causes unnecessary cost to vehicle operators, congestion, avoidable overtaking accidents and creates an uneven playing field for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freight and logistics sector is an essential part of the economy, vital to businesses of all sizes and sectors. Raising &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; speed limits on single carriageway roads could lead to quicker journeys and lower costs for the sector, aiding economic growth as well as reducing frustration for the many drivers who find themselves stuck behind slower-moving lorries on busy roads unable to overtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are other consequences of greater speed – both in terms of the environmental impacts and the potential effects on road safety. The department wants to make sure we have carefully considered the evidence of all of the effects on the economy, environment and road safety before any decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on bus subsidy reform</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, the government published ‘Green light for better buses’ in which it set out a series of reforms to improve local bus subsidy arrangements and regulations in England outside London. The proposals have been carefully formulated to attract more people onto buses, to ensure better value for the taxpayer and to give local transport authorities more influence over their bus networks. This consultation paper seeks views on how the subsidy proposals set out in ‘Green light for better buses’ are to be implemented. In particular the consultation covers how changes to the payment of Bus Service Operators Grant (&lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt;) are to be implemented. &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; is the main form of bus subsidy funded by the government and is paid at present to the companies which operate bus services. The reforms to &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; set out in ‘Green light for better buses’ include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;devolution of &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; to local authorities where the funding relates to services they support - i.e. tendered services - to allow decisions to be taken locally on how it should be spent;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creation of a new local government fund - Better Bus Areas - to encourage local transport authorities and bus companies to work closely together to improve services and boost passenger numbers;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;devolution to Transport for London or the Greater London Authority of the &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt; paid to London bus operators who operate services under contract to TfL; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tightening the existing rules defining which bus services can claim &lt;abbr title="Bus Service Operators Grant"&gt;BSOG&lt;/abbr&gt;, so that the funding is put to the best possible use.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>History of road safety and the driving test</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver licences were first introduced in Britain by the Motor Car Act, 1903, purely as a means of identifying vehicles and their drivers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All motor vehicles had to be registered, display registration marks and be licensed annually at a cost of 20 shillings (£1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fee for the first driving licence, which was obtained over the counter at Post Offices, was 5 shillings (25p).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to sign your driving licence with your ‘ordinary signature’ could lead to a fine of up to £5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1921 there were only 1 million drivers in Britain. By 1939 this figure had risen to 3 million. But it was only during the 1960s, when cars became more affordable, that motoring really took off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1973 the number of drivers had risen to about 20 million and a centralised computer-based licensing system was brought in to cope with the huge increase in demand for both driver and vehicle licences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-highway-code"&gt;The Highway Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of copies of The Highway Code are sold each year, ensuring that it never leaves the bestseller lists. It’s one of the few books in print that can lay claim to saving thousands of lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was first launched in 1931 there were just 2.3 million motor vehicles in Great Britain, yet over 7,000 people were killed in road accidents each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Highway Code first edition" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1084/highway-code-first-edition.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Highway Code first edition&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today there are more than 27 million vehicles on our roads but, thanks to greater public awareness, advances in technology and the introduction of British summer time, only half the number of road deaths occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things have not changed over the years: the very first edition of The Highway Code urged all road users to be careful and considerate towards others, putting safety first. However, other aspects of the code have changed considerably. For example, in 1931 mirrors were not even mentioned and drivers were advised to sound their horn when overtaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, advice on how to cross the road fills a whole chapter, but in the early days it only merited a paragraph. More than a third of the original 24-page booklet described the various hand signals the police and road users should use, compared to the single page given to the subject in the current edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-first-edition"&gt;The first edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first edition was published in 1931, it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cost 1 old penny&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;was the only one to carry advertisements, for the AA, The Autocar magazine, The Motorcycle magazine, Castrol Motor Oil, BP, Motor Union Insurance and the RAC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contained 18 pages of advice, compared to 135 pages in the 2007 edition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;included advice to drivers of horse drawn vehicles to ‘rotate the whip above the head; then incline the whip to the right or left to show the direction in which the turn is to be made.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since those early days, regular revisions of the Code have reflected changes in technology and developments in traffic management and road safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="road-signs"&gt;Road signs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams of road signs - just 10 signs in all - were first seen in the second edition, as was a warning about the dangers of driving when affected by alcohol or fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stopping-distances"&gt;Stopping distances&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping distances made their first appearance in the third edition, along with new sections giving hints on driving and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="in-colour"&gt;In colour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1954 Highway Code, complemented by brand new colour illustrations, gave over the back cover to first aid guidance, while the expanded traffic signs section contained the first triangular warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="motorways"&gt;Motorways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of motorways in the late 1950s led to the inclusion, in the fifth edition, of a new section on motorway driving. It explained such things as how to use exit slip roads and advising drivers to avoid drowsiness by stretching their legs at the parking or service areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="photographs-and-3d-illustrations"&gt;Photographs and 3D illustrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the sixth edition in 1968 photographs and 3D illustrations had been included to help make rules clear and the price had risen from 6 old pence to 1/3d (6p). After decimalisation reprinted editions cost just 6 new pence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="green-cross-code"&gt;Green Cross Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 70-page 1978 edition introduced the Green Cross Code for pedestrians and the new orange badges for people with a disability. Prompted by soaring car crime statistics, the amended version contained advice on vehicle security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="theory-test"&gt;Theory test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s saw a new format taller booklet and the inclusion of a section geared to the new driving theory test, which in the current edition has now become part of the Code itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="getting-social"&gt;Getting social&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 the Highway Code joined social networking websites Twitter and Facebook to share reminders of the rules of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-highway-code-app"&gt;The Highway Code app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2012 &lt;a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/official-highway-code/id522687241?mt=8" title="The Official Highway Code app"&gt;The Official Highway Code app&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad was launched, priced £3.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section"&gt;1888&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first recorded sale of a manufactured motor car was to Emile Roger of Paris, who bought a petrol-driven Benz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-1"&gt;1907&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabs with meters began operating in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-2"&gt;1930&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulations introduced covering endorsements and fitness declaration. The Road Traffic Act 1930 introduces licensing system for public service vehicles (&lt;abbr title="Public service vehicle"&gt;PSV&lt;/abbr&gt;). In the early days of motoring, one licence covered both cars and motorcycles use. Age restrictions and a form of driving tests brought in for disabled drivers. Full licences for disabled drivers valid for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-3"&gt;1931&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Public service vehicle"&gt;PSV&lt;/abbr&gt; drivers could be required to take a test, at discretion of Traffic Commissioners.
The first edition of the Highway Code was published including advice for motorcycle riders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="february"&gt;1934 (16 February)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licences for lorry drivers were introduced under the Road Traffic Act, 1934 - the licensing authority could require the applicant to submit to a practical test of their ability.
‘Belisha’ beacons provide advanced warning of new pedestrian crossings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="march"&gt;1935 (16 March)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voluntary testing was introduced by the Road Traffic Act, 1934, to avoid a rush of candidates when the test becomes compulsory. Mr J Beene was the first person to pass his driving test, at a cost of 7/ 6d (37.5p)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="june"&gt;1935 (1 June)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compulsory testing was brought in for all drivers and riders who started driving on or after 1 April 1934:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;around 246,000 candidates applied&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the pass rate was 63%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;between 9 and 16 half-hour tests were conducted each day by 250 examiners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those passing the motorcycling test did not need to take another test to drive a car. The test was conducted by the examiner positioning themselves at a point where they could observe the motorcyclist’s riding such as beside a common or in a city square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of sidecar outfits or three-wheelers, the examiner might have accompanied the rider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examiners were responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;handling the booking of driving tests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they met candidates at pre-arranged locations such as car parks or railway stations because there were no test centres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other road safety milestones included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyone buying a driving licence must put ‘L’ plates on the car and eventually take a driving test to get their full licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a 30 miles per hour (mph) speed limit was introduced in urban areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;windscreen wipers were used for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="january"&gt;1937 (1 January)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speedometers and safety glass in windscreens were made compulsory.
Provisional licences were brought in for heavy goods vehicle (&lt;abbr title="Heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;) drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september"&gt;1939 (2 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving tests were suspended for the duration of World War 2. During the war, examiners  were redeployed to traffic duties and supervision of fuel rationing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="january-1"&gt;1940 (1 January)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; licences and tests were suspended during World War 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="november"&gt;1946 (1 November)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing resumed after World War 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-4"&gt;1947&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations placed motorcyclists in their own licence group, but testing remained virtually unchanged until the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="february-1"&gt;1947 (18 February)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A period of 1 year was granted for wartime provisional licences to be converted into full licence without passing the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-5"&gt;1950&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pass rate for the driving test was 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-6"&gt;1951&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zebra crossings were introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october"&gt;1956 (19 October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test fee doubled from 10 shillings (50p) to £1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="november-1"&gt;1956 (24 November)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing was suspended during the Suez Crisis. Learners were allowed to drive unaccompanied and examiners helped to administer petrol rations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="april"&gt;1957 (15 April)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing resumed after Suez Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="july"&gt;1957 (15 July)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisional licences were no longer stamped with ‘passed test’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-1"&gt;1957 (1 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-year driving licence was introduced under the Road Traffic Act 1956. The fee for a replacement licence, if lost or defaced, rises by 150% from 1 shilling (5p) to 2/ 6d (12.5p).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="march-1"&gt;1958 (1 March)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisional licences are valid for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="december"&gt;1958 (December)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M6 Preston bypass was the first stretch of motorway built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-7"&gt;1959&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new examiner training facility was acquired at Stanmore training school, near Heathrow. Until then, examiners were trained ‘on the job’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="november-2"&gt;1959 (2 November)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M1 was officially opened, in the early days it had none of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speed limit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;central reservation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;crash barriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;motorway lighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="july-1"&gt;1961 (1 July)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learner riders were restricted to machines of no more than 250cc capacity in order to deal with the high number of motorcycling fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="april-1"&gt;1962 (1 April)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who had held more than 7 provisional licences were required to take a driving test; if they failed to do so, the licensing authority could refuse a further application for a licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-8"&gt;1963&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Road Traffic Act 1962 permitted riders to ride motorcycles of more than 250cc after passing their test. New grouping systems were introduced for driving tests and driving licences and a distinction was made between the test of competence and the test of fitness.  Mopeds were placed in their own vehicle group for driving test purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-9"&gt;1964&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A voluntary register of approved driving instructors (ADIs) was set up under the Road Traffic Act 1962. To become an &lt;abbr title="Approved driving instructor"&gt;ADI&lt;/abbr&gt; you had to pass stringent written and practical tests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-10"&gt;1965&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralised licensing system was set up at new Swansea Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre (&lt;abbr title="Driver and vehicle licensing centre"&gt;DVLC&lt;/abbr&gt;), taking over licence issue from County/Borough councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="may"&gt;1965 (1 May)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application form for a driving or motorcycle licence was revised. The medical standard for eyesight was changed. The distance from which a driving test candidate must be able read a number plate was changed to 67 feet for 3 1/8 inch high characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="may-1"&gt;1967 (10 May)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Road Safety Act 1967 paved the way for regulations covering the licensing and testing of &lt;abbr title="Heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; drivers. The Driving and Motor Licences Division (&lt;abbr title="Driving and motor licensing division"&gt;DMLD&lt;/abbr&gt;) began promoting safe driving through film and TV ‘shorts’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october-1"&gt;1967 (8 October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New drink-drive laws came into force: the legal limit was 80mg alcohol in 100ml blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="july-2"&gt;1968 (2 July)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test fee was increased to £1 and 15 shillings (£1.75p).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="june-1"&gt;1969 (2 June)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to the driving test included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vehicles used in the test must not have dual accelerator control unless this had been made inoperable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a separate driving licence group for automatic vehicles was introduced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;candidates were required to produce their driving licence to the examiner at the test and sign the examiner’s attendance record - examiners could refuse to conduct a test if these requirements were not met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="june-2"&gt;1969 (25 June)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vehicle and Driver Licences Act introduced new regulations, including a licence fee increase and the specification of vehicle groupings for the purposes of driving tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="august"&gt;1969 (4 August)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An up-to-date scheme was introduced for licensing and testing new lorry drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="november-3"&gt;1969 (November)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first official driving manual published, called ‘Driving - the Ministry of Transport Manual’, priced 12/ 6d (62.5p).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-11"&gt;1970&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All driving instructors now had to be officially registered. A total of 3,500 people are prosecuted for driving on a forged licence or wrongfully attempting to obtain a licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;abbr title="Heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; test prompted a change in &lt;abbr title="Public service vehicle"&gt;PSV&lt;/abbr&gt; testing. Previously, vehicle inspectors had carried out &lt;abbr title="Public service vehicle"&gt;PSV&lt;/abbr&gt; driving tests: this was taken over by &lt;abbr title="Heavy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; qualified examiners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-12"&gt;1972&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand for driving tests rose by 20%, and a further 15% in the following year, leading to a huge backlog of tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="december-1"&gt;1972 (16 December)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum age for riders of motorbikes over 50cc was raised from 16 to 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-13"&gt;1973&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crash helmets were made compulsory. The top speed for mopeds was set at 30mph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="march-2"&gt;1973 (1 March)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computerised driving licences were issued for the first time, with green paper licences replacing the old-style red booklets. A full licence was still only valid for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="may-"&gt;1975 (May )&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates no longer have to demonstrate arm signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="january-2"&gt;1976 (1 January)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full licences are now valid until the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="july-1976"&gt;July 1976&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stanmore training school where examiners were trained was relocated to new premises at Cardington, Bedfordshire. Newly recruited ‘L’ test examiners had to undergo four weeks of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-14"&gt;1981&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government produced a 3 point package of changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the maximum size of learner machines was reduced to 125cc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provisional motorcycling licence entitlement was limited to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a two-part test was introduced with the intention of reducing accidents by steering learners to take training with approved organisations on suitable motorcycles - the first part of the test included some basic off-road motorcycle control exercises - usually conducted at large goods vehicle (LGV) centres - the second part included the usual on-road riding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="october-2"&gt;1982 (1 October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisional licences were extended until the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="march-3"&gt;1985 (March)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Public service vehicle"&gt;PSV&lt;/abbr&gt; driving tests became compulsory. Previously, Traffic Commissioners decided whether local applicants took the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-15"&gt;1988&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving tests were now conducted under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1988.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october-3"&gt;1989 (1 October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new accompanied motorcycle test was introduced. Prompted by alarming accident figures, the old-style ‘part 2’ motorcycle test, where the examiner stood by the roadside, was replaced by the new, more demanding ‘pursuit test’. The examiner now follows the candidate on a motorcycle and maintains radio contact during the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="april-2"&gt;1990 (1 April)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) was created as an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT). &lt;abbr title="Driver and vehicle licensing centre"&gt;DVLC&lt;/abbr&gt; became an executive agency of DfT and was renamed the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provisional licence holders were prevented from carrying pillion passengers, even if the passenger is a full licence holder. Compulsory Basic Training (&lt;abbr title="Compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt;) was introduced for all new learner riders of motorcycles and mopeds. &lt;abbr title="Compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt; comprises 5 elements including a minimum two-hour accompanied road ride. The course was designed to ensure new riders have a basic level of competence before they are allowed to ride on public roads displaying L plates and continue the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="may-2"&gt;1990 (1 May)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examiners gave candidates a brief explanation of faults committed during the test, plus advice on areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october-4"&gt;1990 (October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under new legislation, anyone accompanying a learner driver must be at least 21 and must have held a driving licence for a minimum of 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="november-4"&gt;1995 (November)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pass Plus scheme was introduced to help newly qualified young drivers gain valuable driving experience and reduce the risk of them being involved in an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="july-3"&gt;1996 (1 July)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate written theory test was introduced replacing questions asked about the Highway Code during practical test. Candidates now have to produce their driving licence for their test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october-5"&gt;1996 (1 October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory test pass mark was raised from 26/35 to 30/35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section-16"&gt;1997&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction of additional licence categories and tests for learners aged over 21 years riding larger motorcycles (Direct Access Scheme) and small motorcycles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New riders under 21 years restricted to riding machines of 125cc whilst learning. Once they pass the test they were then restricted to riding machines of 25kw (33bhp) for two years. After this period they could ride any size of motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="january-3"&gt;1997 (1 January)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New licence and test changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new test category was created for a car with large trailer (B+E)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;licence categories and tests were introduced for Direct Access and small motorcycles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the written theory test was introduced for LGV and &lt;abbr title="Passenger carrying vehicle"&gt;PCV&lt;/abbr&gt; drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="march-4"&gt;1997 (1 March)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographic ID was required for both practical and theory tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="june-3"&gt;1997 (1 June)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a new driver gained 6 or more penalty points during the first 2 years of driving, they lost their licence and must retake both the theory and practical driving test before being allowed back on the roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-2"&gt;1997 (29 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting times between tests was reintroduced for unsuccessful candidates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for car drivers and motorcycle riders, the minimum wait of 10 days between tests of the same category  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for lorry and bus driver testing, a minimum wait of 3 days between tests of the same category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="august-1"&gt;1998 (August)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocard licences were introduced from 1 July 1999 for both first time issues and licence renewals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="february-2"&gt;1999 (February)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly revised Highway Code was published, with current advice and up-to-date legislation for all road users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="april-3"&gt;1999 (6 April)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars being used for a driving test must now have a front passenger seat belt, head restraint and rear-view mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="may-3"&gt;1999 (4 May)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to the ‘L’ test included extending the length of the test, randomising the emergency stop manoeuvre and failing candidates for committing 16 or more driving faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="january-4"&gt;2000 (4 January)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touch-screen theory test was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="february-3"&gt;2001 (1 February)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers gaining a full car licence must now pass compulsory basic training (&lt;abbr title="Compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt;) before being allowed to ride a moped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various changes to the motorcycle training regulations were introduced, including the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduction of the validity period for a &lt;abbr title="Compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt; certificate from 3 to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;removal of the 2 year on - 1 year off rule for provisional licence holders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requirement for drivers gaining a full car licence to take &lt;abbr title="Compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt; before being able to ride a moped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="december-2"&gt;2001 (19 December)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates can now book their theory test via the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="nov"&gt;2002 (14 Nov)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hazard perception element was introduced into the motorcycle theory test; this uses video clips to test candidates’ awareness of hazards on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-3"&gt;2003 (1 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Show me’ and ‘tell me’ vehicle safety questions were added to the beginning of the driving test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october-6"&gt;2003 (24 October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates can book their practical test on the Internet for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="november-5"&gt;2006 (November)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced rider scheme was launched&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="february-4"&gt;2007 (February)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The register of post-test motorcycle training (&lt;abbr title="Register of post-test motorcycle trainers"&gt;RPMT&lt;/abbr&gt;) was introduced&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-4"&gt;2007 (3 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of questions in car and motorcycle theory test changed from 35 to 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-5"&gt;2008 (10 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further changes to the driving test included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an assessment of eco-safe driving was introduced in the driving test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driver certificate of professional competence (&lt;abbr title="Certificate of professional competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt;) was introduced for professional bus and coach drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="april-4"&gt;2009 (27 April)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new two part modular motorcycle test was introduced enabling the UK to comply with the EU Second Directive requiring new and more demanding manoeuvres to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="module-1"&gt;Module 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Module 1 contains the specified manoeuvres element of the test which is conducted off-road. It includes exercises designed to assess the rider’s ability to control their machine safely, including avoidance and emergency stop exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="module-2"&gt;Module 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Module 2 includes an eyesight test and 30 minutes of on-road riding, assessing the rider’s ability to safely interact with other road users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-6"&gt;2009 (10 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver &lt;abbr title="Certificate of professional competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt; for lorry drivers was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-7"&gt;2009 (28 September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case study was introduced into the theory test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="april-5"&gt;2010 (6 April)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="observer-on-test"&gt;Observer on test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 6 April 2010, driving test candidates have been encouraged to take their instructor with them on their test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="june-4"&gt;2010 (June)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new coalition government announced a review of the current motorcycle test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="october-7"&gt;2010 (4 October)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Independent driving’ became part of the practical driving test - candidates have to drive for 10 minutes making their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="september-8"&gt;2011 (September)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New case study was introduced into the theory test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="top-10-driving-test-facts"&gt;Top 10 driving test facts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving test’s been going for more than 75  years - here are a few facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr Beene was the first person to pass the driving test in 1935: he paid the grand total of 7/ 6p (37.5p) to take the test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there were no test centres in 1935 so you had to arrange to meet the examiner somewhere like a post office, train station or town hall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the test was suspended for the duration of World War 2 and didn’t resume until 1 November 1946&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in 1975, candidates no longer had to demonstrate hand signals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the theory test was introduced in 1996, replacing questions about the Highway Code during the practical test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;driving was much more hazardous 75 years ago, 7,343 people were killed on Great Britain’s roads when only 2.4 million vehicles were in use - in 2008, 2,538 people were killed with 26.5 million vehicles on the road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;candidates could book their theory test online for the first time in December 2001&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the pass rate in 1935 was 63 per cent compared to 46 per cent in 2009&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1969 saw the first driving test set for an automatic vehicle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;since 1935 more than 46 million tests have been taken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
