advice and assistance and support to British nationals travelling 
overseas. Britons make over 50 million overseas trips each year and

British Embassy is there to help.
The help we can provide is limited so it’s important to take as many 
precautions as possible before you travel, and to know what our 
limitations are.
Our Customer Charter sets out our commitment to providing a high level of service to you and what we ask from you in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
