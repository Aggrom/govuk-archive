<h3 id="applications-to-higher-education">Applications to Higher Education</h3>

<p>Prospective full-time undergraduate students apply to Higher Education (<abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr>) through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (<abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr>) prior to the start of the academic year. <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> publishes statistics on the number of applicants to full-time undergraduate courses, as well as the number of applicants who have been accepted. <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> figures provide the first indication of trends in <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> student numbers in a given academic year. Data is available from 1996/7 academic year of entry and covers the whole UK. The latest statistics can be found in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ucas.com/about_us/media_enquiries/media_releases">Media Release section of the <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> does not cover part-time undergraduate students, nor those who apply directly to institutions; application data on such students is not held centrally. Furthermore, some accepted applicants to <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> choose not to take up their place, or may decide to defer their studies. Therefore in any given academic year, the <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> accepted applicants group is not equivalent to the actual <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> entrant population.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> has facilitated some postgraduate applications via UKPASS (UK Postgraduate Application and Statistical Service) since 2007, and <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> also handles applications to postgraduate teacher training courses. However many postgraduate students continue to apply directly to institutions so comprehensive information on all postgraduate applications is not held centrally. Further information about UKPASS is available at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukpass.ac.uk/aboutus">UKPASS website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="student-finance">Student finance</h3>

<p>When a prospective student applies for a place on a <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> course, they can apply for financial support through the Student Loans Company (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>). Information on the financial support available to <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> students in England is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/index.htm">DirectGov website</a>.</p>

<p>Each year, Student Finance England (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>’s England operations) publishes Official Statistics on student finance applications and payment processing at intervals between the first application deadline (31 May) up to the start of university term-time (around October). These statistics have been published since the 2009/10 academic year, in response to increased levels of public interest in <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>’s progress with support payments, and cover England. Links to these statistics can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/official-statistics-releases/student-support-applications">Student Support Applications page</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> annually publishes National Statistics on Student Support Awards (loan rates, loan take-up, grants awarded etc) in November. This release has been published since the 2004/05 academic year for England. A link to these statistics can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/national-statistics-releases/student-support-for-higher-education">Student Support page</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> also publishes equivalent National Statistics on <a rel="external" href="http://www.slc.co.uk/statistics/official-statistics-archive.aspx">Student Support Awards for Wales and Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-student-number-statistics">Early student number statistics</h3>

<p>The Higher Education Funding Council for England (<abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr>) collects and publishes information on students in the current academic year, from the Higher Education Students Early Statistics (HESES) and Higher Education in Further Education: Students Survey (HEIFES). These are the first comprehensive set of statistics on student numbers to appear in the public domain based on the <abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr> administrative returns – they contain elements of forecasting and estimation. They are published as part of <a rel="external" href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/data/year/2012/studentnumbersfromhesesandheifesmarch2012/name,72024,en.html"><abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr>’s grant announcement</a>.</p>

<h3 id="student-characteristics">Student characteristics</h3>

<p>When students start their <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> course, they are recorded on the Higher Education Statistics Agency (<abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr>) Student Record. The <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> Student Record is more comprehensive than the <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> data as it covers all students at UK Higher Education Institutions (undergraduate, postgraduate; home and overseas students; full-time, part-time and other modes of study) by a wide variety of fields. For example, level of study, domicile, subject of study, class of degree etc. <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> annually publishes a Statistical First Release in January, covering student entrants, enrolments and qualifications obtained (since the 2005/06 academic year in its current form). This covers UK <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institutions.</p>

<p>A link to the latest release can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/national-statistics-releases/higher-education-student-enrolments-and-qualifications-obtained">Higher Education Student Enrolments and Qualifications page</a>. In addition to its National Statistics products, <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> also publishes a number of <a rel="external" href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1897&amp;Itemid=239">student data tables</a> on their website. These cover UK <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institutions, with some country-level information.</p>

<p><abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> also produces the “Performance Indicators in Higher Education” which provide comparative data on the performance of institutions in widening participation, student retention, learning and teaching outcomes, research output and employment of graduates. They cover UK-domiciled students at publicly-funded higher education institutions in the UK. <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> has published the Performance Indicators since the 2002/03 academic year. Before then, they were published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England from the 1996/97 academic year.</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2072&amp;Itemid=141">Performance Indicators are published on the <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> website</a>.</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/data/pi"><abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr> Performance Indicators</a> are published on the <abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr> website.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a difference between overall <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> student numbers and the number who are funded (in the case of England, via <abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr>). The <a rel="external" href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/invest/institns/annallocns/governmentgrantletter">grant letter</a> to <abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr> from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills sets out <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> funding decisions.</p>

<h3 id="participation-rates">Participation rates</h3>

<p>BIS publishes the Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR) as part of the Participation Rates in Higher Education Statistical First Release in March each year. The HEIPR roughly equates to the probability that a seventeen year old will participate in higher education by age thirty given the age specific participation rates. HEIPR figures have been published going back to the 1999/2000 academic year, although the current methodology only allows a comparable time series back to 2006/07. A link to the latest release can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/national-statistics-releases/participation-rates-in-higher-education">Participation Rates page</a>.</p>

<p>HEIPR is an England-based participation rate; the Devolved Administrations also produce <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/national-statistics-releases/participation-rates-in-higher-education"><abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> participation measures</a> which fulfil their own measurement requirements.</p>

<h3 id="graduate-destinations">Graduate destinations</h3>

<p>Six months after graduation, <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> carries out the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey to gather information regarding graduates’ post <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> destinations. This data is published annually in July as a Statistical First Release and has been released since the 1994/95 academic year, covering UK <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institutions. A link to the latest release can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/national-statistics-releases/destinations-of-leavers-from-higher-education">Destinations of Leavers</a> page.</p>

<p>The proportion of graduates in employment or further study by Higher Education Institution is also published separately in July as one of <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr>’s Performance Indicators, as mentioned above.</p>

<h3 id="annual-overview-of-he">Annual overview of <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> publishes an annual National Statistics Volume in September (since the 1996/97 academic year). This covers <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> applicants and acceptances (from <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr>), student support awards (from <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>), student entrants, enrolments, qualifications obtained, destinations of graduates, staff and finance of <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institutions (from <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr>), international comparisons of participation and graduation rates (from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD) and <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> qualification levels in the population (from the Office for National Statistics, ONS). The volume covers UK <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institutions. A link to the latest release can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/national-statistics-releases/higher-education-statistics-for-the-uk">Higher Education Statistics for the United Kingdom page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="repayment-of-student-loans">Repayment of student loans</h3>

<p>Once graduates start work and begin to earn a salary over the repayment threshold, they enter into repayment of their student loan. The <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> publishes National Statistics on loan outlays, repayments of loans and borrower activity annually in June; these releases have been available from the 2004-05 financial year for England. A link to the latest of these publications can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/national-statistics-releases/student-loans-for-higher-education">Student Loans</a> page.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> also publishes equivalent National Statistics on <a rel="external" href="http://www.slc.co.uk/statistics/official-statistics-archive.aspx">Student Loans for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> publishes additional Official Statistics which provide more detailed breakdowns of information from the above National Statistics on student loans, focusing on the loans system which has been in operation since 1998/99, and showing repayments by tax year time series back to the 2000-01 financial year. A link to the latest of these publications can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/analysis/statistics/higher-education/official-statistics-releases/income-contingent-repayments">Income Contingent Repayment page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="longer-term-graduate-destinations">Longer-term graduate destinations</h3>

<p><abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> carries out the Longitudinal Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey on a biennial basis to gather information regarding graduates’ longer-term destinations, three and a half years after graduation. The first survey covered those who graduated in 2002/03. This data is published biennially in September as an Official Statistics publication, and covers UK <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institutions.

<p>Publicly-funded <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institutions provide the majority of <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> provision in the UK; however there are other routes available as follows:</p>

<h4 id="private-providers">Private providers</h4>

<p>There are many private providers of <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> courses in the UK. These are not subject to public funding and the associated controls on student numbers, but they do offer legitimate courses leading to recognised <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> qualifications. Data is not routinely collected from private providers of <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr>, however <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> collected some information during the 2009/10 academic year, which covered <a rel="external" href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php/content/view/2090/161">private providers of <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> in the UK</a>.</p>

<h4 id="further-education-colleges">Further Education colleges</h4>

<p>A significant proportion of UK <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> students gain their qualifications through study at further Education (<abbr title="Further Education">FE</abbr>) colleges. Some of these colleges provide <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> provision through franchising arrangements with a <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institution (i.e. the <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> institution awards the qualification following study at the <abbr title="Further Education">FE</abbr> college). <abbr title="Further Education">FE</abbr> data is collected separately by each country of the UK. In England, such data is collected by the <a rel="external" href="http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk">Skills Funding Agency</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/lt/heinfe/publications"><abbr title="Higher Education Funding Council for England">HEFCE</abbr> has published some information and headline statistics about <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> in <abbr title="Further Education">FE</abbr> in England</a>.</p>
