    <title>Regulation of aviation security</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am publishing a summary of responses to the government’s consultation on better regulation for aviation security, and announcing the government’s decision on taking forward the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation document &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21/"&gt;Better regulation for aviation security&lt;/a&gt; set out proposals to modernise the regulatory regime for aviation security to bring it into line with better regulation principles, promote innovation and efficiency and ensure the best possible passenger experience. It proposed a move to an Outcome Focused Risk Based (&lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt;) approach which would give operators the flexibility and responsibility to design security processes that deliver specified security outcomes, perhaps more focussed towards the needs of their passengers, rather than requiring them, as at present, to comply with prescriptive security requirements. It builds on the successful and similar approach that now applies in aviation safety regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to an &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; approach would be managed through the introduction of a Security Management System (&lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt;) developed and operated by each responsible organisation. A &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; is an organised, systematic approach to managing security which embeds security management into the day-to-day activities of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will begin with a series of &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; pilots, starting at London City Airport once the Olympics have finished, in which industry operators will develop the &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; approach and in so doing enhance their internal security cultures. The pilot at London City Airport will be concerned only with the organisation and governance of security at the airport, not with the security checks themselves, which will continue to be managed and delivered in the current way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once these pilots have been concluded, and we are satisfied that the &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; process is sufficiently robust and will deliver its intended benefits, we shall look to roll it out generally across the industry. This will provide a sound basis for the development and piloting of the &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation ran from 14 July until 7 November 2011. Some 116 responses were received, from a range of organisations and individuals in the aviation industry as well as from interested bodies. I am grateful to them for the time they took in responding and for their informed and constructive comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to say that there was overwhelming support for the proposed new approach. In publishing the consultation the government acknowledged that these are complex proposals which require further development. The responses have been helpful in clarifying some of the issues involved, including importantly the proposed timetable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation proposed that the new arrangements should be phased in over three years starting in April 2013. The Civil Aviation Bill, which is currently before parliament, provides for various aviation security functions that are currently performed by the Department for Transport to be conferred on the Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;). Subject to the date of royal assent, we are preparing for the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; to take on those functions from April 2014. The &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; proposals would represent a significant change in the approach to the regulation of aviation security. We have therefore decided that development and roll-out of &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; is the right first step to take towards the roll-out of the &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; approach. The &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; has been consulted and supports this decision. The conferring of functions on the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; does not depend on this development being completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary report, with further information about our plans for implementing the new approach, will be available in the libraries of both houses and on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The changing face of disclosure and barring</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that good safeguarding practices should involve more than just a criminal record check, such as rigorous reference checking and face-to-face interviews, on-going training and day-to-day management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While as an employer you are best placed to maintain safeguarding practice on the ground, from September 2012, the government is scaling back the criminal records and barring systems to ‘common sense’ levels whilst ensuring that they continue to provide effective safeguarding. These changes will impact on organisations across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and it is important for employers to understand what the impact of these changes might be in their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important changes will be to reduce the numbers of people requiring criminal record checks by reducing regulated activity and scrapping controlled activity. This means that criminal records checks will only be mandatory for those working in close and unsupervised contact with vulnerable groups including children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Home Office has produced a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/crime/disclosure-and-barring/"&gt;leaflet explaining these changes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as letting you know about other changes happening over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a number of seminars on the changes during June and July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Search and rescue helicopters</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 13 July 2011 the Department for Transport commenced a procurement competition for search and rescue helicopter services to replace the existing contracted Maritime and Coastguard Agency (&lt;abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency"&gt;MCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) capability. The procurement process has now concluded, and I wish to inform the House of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contract has been signed to operate search and rescue services from Stornoway and Shetland with Bristow Helicopters Ltd. A separate contract has been signed with CHC Scotia LTD to operate search and rescue services from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency bases at Portland and Lee on the Solent. Operations under both contracts will commence by the time the existing &lt;abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency"&gt;MCA&lt;/abbr&gt; service contract expires, and will continue until June 2017. Both contracts will be managed by the &lt;abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency"&gt;MCA&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I announced on 28 November, procurement is now under way for longer term arrangements which will see search and rescue contracted nationally. Operations will commence under these longer term arrangements during 2015 and the future contractor for the UK will assume responsibility for the &lt;abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency"&gt;MCA&lt;/abbr&gt; capability during 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Change in UK policy on employing armed guards to protect against Somali piracy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK-registered vessels will be able to employ armed guards to defend themselves against pirates in exceptional circumstances under new guidance confirmed by the government today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move comes after a significant increase in the number of attacks against vessels in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden in recent years.  Evidence shows that vessels with armed guards are less likely to be successfully attacked, which is why the government has been working in recent months to allow the lawful use of armed guards in exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance published today includes the factors ship owners should include in a risk assessment and advice on selecting a private security company (PSC).  Shipping companies wishing to use armed guards will also be required to submit a detailed counter-piracy plan to the Department for Transport in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping Minister Mike Penning said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The word ‘pirate’ can conjure up cartoonish images of eye patches, parrots and wooden legs, but the reality is much more serious.  Modern pirates are dangerous, organised criminals who have shown they are not shy of using violence to achieve their goals.  We have not taken this decision lightly. It is clear that we must offer those flying the Red Ensign every opportunity to ensure the safety of their crews and vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By allowing the use of armed guards in a structured, legal framework we can move to a system where ship owners can provide an adequate deterrent against this scourge on the maritime industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the changes published today, any PSC employed to put armed guards onboard UK ships will require authorisation from the Home Office for the possession of prohibited firearms.  The Home Office and police will also carry out checks into the PSC and its personnel before an authorisation is granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance published today will be kept under review to ensure it reflects continuing work being done at both a national and international level to counter the increase in piracy around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/use-of-armed-guards-to-defend-against-piracy"&gt;guidance to the UK shipping industry on the use of armed guards on vessels&lt;/a&gt; is available on the Department for Transport website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The exact circumstances under which the use of armed guards could be permitted are:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when the ship is transiting the high seas throughout the High Risk Area (an area bounded by Suez and the Straights of Hormuz to the North, 10°S and 78°E); and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the latest “Best Management Practices” is being followed fully but, on its own, is not deemed by the shipping company and the ship’s master as sufficient to protect against acts of piracy; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the use of armed guards is assessed to reduce the risk to the lives and well being of those onboard the ship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the last four years, 64 people have lost their lives as a consequence of Somali piracy.  Currently 12 vessels and over 240 hostages are in the control of pirates off the Somali coast.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Search and rescue helicopters</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House of the government’s intentions for the future of the search and rescue helicopter service in the UK. Following the cancellation of the SAR-H Private Finance Initiative in February, the Department for Transport will today publish a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/uk-sar-helicopter-services"&gt;notice&lt;/a&gt; in the Official Journal of the European Union to commence procurement for a new UK wide service contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Rt. Hon Friend the Defence Secretary has agreed that the new contract will provide a search and rescue capability provided by civilian crews, enabling our armed forces to focus activity on their front line operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force crews have shown great dedication and professionalism in delivering an exemplary search and rescue service for many years, and we owe them all great thanks for this. Looking forward, we are confident that, building on nearly 30 years of civilian service provided under contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (&lt;abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency"&gt;MCA&lt;/abbr&gt;), a fully civilian service will be able to maintain the same standards in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This competition will procure a contracted search and rescue helicopter service for the whole of the UK, for a period of approximately 10 years. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy will continue to provide search and rescue coverage until the replacement for this capability is in place, and it is my intention that the contract I let will require this to be the first part of the new service to become operational. This will ensure that the Ministry of Defence is able to meet its previously announced intention to withdraw from service and retire its fleet of Sea King helicopters by March 2016. The replacement for the capability currently provided by the &lt;abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency"&gt;MCA&lt;/abbr&gt; will follow on from this. This transition will ensure continuity of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bidders for the future service will be able to put forward options which will utilise a mixed fleet of modern helicopters based on the capabilities required at each of the bases (such as range, carrying capacity and endurance). The services will be capable of delivery by different contractors providing complementary services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a modern fleet of fast, reliable helicopters will lead to major improvements in the capability available from the present mix of helicopters. Modern helicopters operating from 10 full-time bases can not only continue to meet all current service requirements but also provide faster flying times to a large part of the UK search and rescue region, as well as providing a more reliable service. This will therefore be reflected in the new contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my intention that search and rescue operations will cease at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Boulmer in 2015 and at &lt;abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency"&gt;MCA&lt;/abbr&gt; Portland when the interim arrangements that were announced in July expire. Other operations at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Boulmer will be unaffected by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity of the issues that need to be considered by bidders during the procurement, I intend that this procurement will be undertaken using the competitive dialogue procedure. As far as is practicable however, I intend to run the competition using lean procurement principles during some stages of the procurement. This will, I hope, both expedite and simplify some stages of the procurement that would ordinarily be time consuming and costly for industry to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect to award a contract in early 2013 to give the future service provider time to mobilise the new capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/airport-security-scanners"/>
    <title>Airport security scanners</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Day 2009 an attempted attack on Northwest flight 253 from Amsterdam Schiphol to Detroit was made using an explosive device concealed in the underwear of a passenger. The device had been constructed with the aim of making detection by existing screening methods extremely difficult and had not been picked up by airport security at any point throughout the passenger’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous government’s response to this threat included introducing security scanners at UK airports. Security scanners were deployed at Heathrow and Manchester airports in February 2010. They were deployed at Gatwick airport a few months later, meaning that today scanners are in operation at three of the largest UK airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A public &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/2010-23"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt;on an interim code of practice for the use of security scanners began just before the general election. After the election, my predecessor, Philip Hammond, extended the consultation to allow more time for people to respond. The consultation closed on 19 July 2010 and over 6,000 responses were received. These have been analysed and I can now announce how we intend to deploy security scanners in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming feedback from airports is that nearly all passengers accept the use of security scanners and find the process quick and convenient. Out of over a million scans the Government is aware of only twelve refusals. However, I recognise that some passengers have concerns about the use of security scanners and these concerns were reflected in the responses to the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ways in which security scanners can be deployed have been restricted by European legislation. My predecessor asked the Transport Commissioner to bring forward proposals which relax these restrictions, and allow scanners to be used more flexibly. An outline package which would achieve this was presented to the European Aviation Security Committee in July and has now been agreed by the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most responses to the consultation expressed discomfort with the idea of having an image of their body captured for analysis, and they indicated that - if selected for a security scan - they would prefer to opt for an alternative method of screening. I have considered this carefully. However, I have decided against it, on security, operational and privacy grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I do not believe that a ‘pat down’ search is equivalent in security terms to a security scan. The purpose of introducing security scanners in the first place was to protect the travelling public better against sophisticated terrorist threats: these threats still exist and the required level of security is not achieved by permitting passengers to choose a less effective alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have considered carefully whether there are alternative screening methods which might deliver equivalent levels of security to a security scan. A full private search - involving the loosening and/or removal of clothing in the presence of security staff in a private room - would deliver a reasonable level of assurance. However, I believe that this is likely to represent a greater intrusion of privacy than a security scan, and that nearly all passengers, if they fully understand the procedures, would be unlikely to opt for this alternative. It is also likely to be operationally disruptive to airports and other passengers. Appropriately trained security staff would need to be diverted from the main search area to undertake these searches, leading to increased costs and longer queues for everyone else. I do not, therefore, believe that this represents a viable way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that the proposals recently agreed by the European Parliament include the right for passengers to request an opt out from scanning. The UK did not support these proposals when they were presented to the Aviation Security Committee. Given the security arguments against permitting such an opt-out, and the threat level that exists in the UK, the Government intends to use its powers under the Aviation Security Act to maintain the current position. Those passengers selected for scanning will therefore not be able to fly if they are not willing to be scanned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also asked people whether they had any health concerns relating to the small doses of ionising radiation produced by some security scanners. Only a limited number of responses were received on this issue, but I recognise that it has continued to be a contentious issue. Last year, experts from the Health Protection Agency (&lt;abbr title="Health Protection Agency"&gt;HPA&lt;/abbr&gt;) conducted an official assessment of the x-ray backscatter scanner in use at some UK airports. The &lt;abbr title="Health Protection Agency"&gt;HPA&lt;/abbr&gt; found that the dose of ionising radiation received from deployed backscatter scanners is the equivalent to that received naturally through just two minutes of flying at high altitude.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has called for further expert consideration of the potential health risks from security scanners and has asked the European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to review the evidence. I look forward to the Committee’s report and will consider it carefully before making decisions about which technologies should be deployed at UK airports in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is right that the Government does what it can to address people’s concerns wherever that is possible without compromising security. Therefore I can announce today that the Government intends to make further improvements to the privacy and data safeguards already in place for security scanners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software which automatically analyses images is currently in development. Where this technology has developed to a stage at which it passes rigorous Government testing, airports will be expected to deploy it when they renew or replace their equipment. This will mean that in the future images will no longer be seen by human reviewers. In addition, airports will also be required to undertake routine testing of hardware and software to ensure that they remain unable to copy, save, or otherwise transmit images. This will be verified by the Department’s transport security inspectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also been considering whether security scanners should be rolled out more widely at UK airports. In principle, I believe that they should. My officials will work with the aviation industry to agree a risk-based approach to further deployments. However, I want to make sure that this is done in conjunction with the availability of enhanced screening technology with better privacy safeguards. The precise timing of further deployments will therefore be dependent on how quickly the new generation of security scanners is developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have placed a copy of this statement, and the revised regulations on the use of security scanners at UK airports, in the libraries of both houses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make time for winter</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all need time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to get to work, time to get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to deliver goods around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the weather isn’t great, travelling can take a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By spending time preparing for the snow and ice, we can all help keep the country on the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="countdown-to-an-easier-winter-journey"&gt;Countdown to an easier winter journey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highways Agency is prepared. They have a fleet of over 500 winter service vehicles on standby and they work with the Met Office to provide vital information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you prepared? Check your vehicle is ready for winter too - and always carry an emergency kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you set off - just a few minutes checking the weather forecast and traffic reports for your journey could make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan your journey around the weather as it provides the Highways Agency with the time and space they need to get ahead of you and keep the network clear for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ASEM Ministerial meeting</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an honour to represent the United Kingdom at this important occasion. As a global trading nation, it is vital for the UK that transport links with Asia are fostered and expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are keen for our companies to participate in Asian markets, and we welcome investments by Asian companies in the UK - not just those from advanced economies in the region, but also from countries that are still developing and expanding their horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have long historical connections with Asia and the Asia-pacific region. Of course, there are sister countries of the UK in the British Commonwealth, and her Majesty Queen Elizabeth is already in Australia for the Commonwealth heads of Government meeting. The Commonwealth is a force for peace and prosperity, and holds a special place in British hearts for its traditions and spirit of harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also have long-held contacts with other countries in Asia, great and small. The English language, so widely spoken, is one of our key assets and one of our gifts to the world - even if so often spoken with an American accent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes of our meeting are sustainability, safety and efficiency. Each of these is critically important for the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to a green transport future is a major goal for us. We need to revitalize our economy after the shocks of recent times, but growth that ignores environmental responsibility is not, ultimately, sustainable. That is why we are investing heavily in such policies as the de-carbonisation of road transport through advance technologies, and pushing for stringent measures to control emissions from aviation and shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also tackling our remaining air pollution hot spots - a problem which particularly affects rapidly growing cities in Asia, and which harms the health of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety is also a primary concern. For many years the UK has been a world leader in road safety. Our roads are the safest in the world, alongside Sweden and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I shall have the privilege of visiting the Tangyuan middle school in Chengdu, which was re-built after the terrible earthquake with money given by one of our famous British companies, BP. I shall talk to the students about British road safety practices and philosophy - my own small contribution to helping prevent deaths and injuries from traffic accidents in Chengdu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I should also pay tribute to the unbreakable spirit of people in Asia in the face of Natural Disasters. The British people have been moved by the resilience of Asian communities - in China, Japan, Pakistan and elsewhere - when disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and final theme of our meeting is the promotion of seamless travel, both for goods and people. This is another shared goal for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just about advanced technologies and systems, It is also about reducing barriers and allowing free and fair competition. I would love to see my government’s new ‘Red Tape challenge’, which is identifying hundreds of outdated or burdensome regulations for the scrap heap, being replicated around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability, safety and efficiency. Three concepts which my country supports fully. We look forward to working with our European and Asian partners, both public and private sector, in our quest to make these concepts a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Regulation of aviation security</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am launching a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; on the government’s proposals to modernise the way we regulate aviation security. Better regulation for aviation security proposes a new outcome focused, risk-based approach to regulation which builds on the successful and similar approach to aviation safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the UK is recognised internationally as having one of the most effective aviation security regimes in the world, we also face a continuing threat from international and domestic terrorism. The government’s recent Strategic Defence and Security Review set out its proposals for securing Britain in an age of uncertainty and included a commitment to improve aviation security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this consultation offer a new approach to the regulation of aviation security. Our current system can place significant financial burdens on the aviation industry along with inconvenience to passengers, and could be more consistent with the government’s better regulation principles. I think we can do better - with a new regime which maintains and improves security standards but in a more efficient and passenger-friendly way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I therefore propose that the government should move from prescribing security processes to setting security outcomes. This will give airports and airlines greater flexibility to deliver high standards of security in ways that that are better integrated with their day-to-day business and designed around the needs of the passenger. It will allow them to adopt appropriate new technology as it become available. I want to move away from the current, highly prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach where all operators run the same regime to one where industry takes a more proactive and more innovative and tailored approach to security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach will also enable the regulator to operate a system of ‘earned autonomy’ - rewarding those operators with the most robust systems of aviation security with greater trust in how they deliver the specified outcomes. Conversely, the level of scrutiny by the regulator will increase proportionately where any concerns arise about the delivery of the required outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The safety and security of passengers will remain of paramount importance to the government, and so the new arrangements will have robust oversight procedures in place to ensure security standards are not compromised. To do this, I am proposing to require all industry operators to develop a security management system. This would demonstrate a clear commitment to providing an overall high level of security and set out how security outcomes specified by the UK Regulator and EU requirements will be delivered. Integral to this will be robust internal quality assurance and auditing arrangements which will complement the regulator’s own assurance and compliance processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also proposes new reporting arrangements whereby industry will regularly report to the regulator on performance and occurrences (including the rectification measures to be taken). This gives the regulator a fuller picture on which to base decisions and direct regulatory effort. I also propose to introduce a system that allows staff to report on a confidential basis any concerns relating to aviation security. These proposed arrangements will provide an additional layer of assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach offers a new partnership between government and the industry, one that is dedicated to maintaining the highest standards in aviation security whilst also improving the passenger experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are complex proposals, which require further development in consultation with the aviation industry and other interested parties. The Department for Transport will be making extensive efforts to engage industry during the consultation process to explain the proposals further and to seek input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the consultation, the government will then consider all responses and produce a summary report along with next steps. I will make a further statement to the House at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Search and rescue interim contract</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 8 February I informed the House that, owing to irregularities in the bidding process, the government had concluded that it was not appropriate to proceed with the previously planned joint &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;/&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;abbr title="Private Finance Initiative"&gt;PFI&lt;/abbr&gt; procurement for future search and rescue capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigation into the circumstances that led to the cancellation of that procurement is ongoing. Work is also underway to identify the optimum procurement options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability for the UK. However, as the existing Maritime and Coastguard Agency search and rescue helicopter contract that provides service at Portland, Lee on Solent, Shetland and the Isle of Lewis is set to expire, I wish to inform the House of my plans to ensure that search and rescue helicopter services from these locations continue uninterrupted until new long term arrangements are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the continuity of services from these locations, the Department for Transport will shortly run a competition to procure an interim service for a period of up to 5 years. This contract will be similar to the arrangements that are currently in place for these bases and are working well. The contract will be open to all interested bidders able to offer a service that fully meets our requirements and ensures the safety of the public and seafarers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arrangements will ensure that search and rescue helicopter services are maintained while the range of options in relation to the long term future provision of such services are being fully considered. The Royal Air Force and Royal Navy will continue to provide coverage from their search and rescue bases as at present, while I consider the options for the long term provision of search and rescue helicopter capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will inform the House later in the year of the government’s intentions for the longer term. The procurement strategy we adopt for the longer term will seek to ensure that the Ministry of Defence is able to complete its previously announced intention to withdraw its Sea Kings from service in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/provision-of-armed-capability-for-the-british-transport-police--4"/>
    <title>Provision of armed capability for the British Transport Police</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is committed to the security of the country and as such keeps our capabilities under constant review. As part of this, I am today announcing, with the agreement of my Right Honourable Friend the Home Secretary, that the security of the railways and London Underground will be further enhanced by the development of a British Transport Police (&lt;abbr title="British Transport Police"&gt;BTP&lt;/abbr&gt;) armed capability that will be deployed as appropriate in response to the terrorism threat level at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has been considering the resilience of the overall police armed capability and has concluded that it would be beneficial to enhance this by providing the &lt;abbr title="British Transport Police"&gt;BTP&lt;/abbr&gt; with an armed capability of its own. The timing of this is not as a result of any specific threat: it is a sensible and pragmatic approach to ensuring that our police forces have the right resources to be able to respond as and when needed to protect the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sanctioning the development of this armed capability, we will reduce the burden on other police forces which currently provide armed support to the &lt;abbr title="British Transport Police"&gt;BTP&lt;/abbr&gt;. This is not a major new capability in terms of overall armed policing, but by training &lt;abbr title="British Transport Police"&gt;BTP&lt;/abbr&gt; officers to carry out armed patrolling of the rail network it equips &lt;abbr title="British Transport Police"&gt;BTP&lt;/abbr&gt; with a capability already available to other police forces. Armed patrols will be deployed according to operational need - it will not be a daily event to see armed officers at stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to work with the &lt;abbr title="British Transport Police"&gt;BTP&lt;/abbr&gt; and others to assess the use of this capability and its effectiveness and impact. I would like to reassure Parliament that this is a measured and proportionate approach to supporting the &lt;abbr title="British Transport Police"&gt;BTP&lt;/abbr&gt; in maintaining public safety on the railway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
