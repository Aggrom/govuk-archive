    <title>MOD helps small firms showcase defence innovation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organised by the Ministry of Defence’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.science.mod.uk/engagement/enterprise.aspx" title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;Centre for Defence Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, the event gives small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) a unique opportunity to engage with big business and offer up ideas and technology that could be used by the Armed Forces in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMEs were joined at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London by academics and researchers from two of the country’s leading universities - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/" title="University of Bristol"&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/" title="Lancaster University"&gt;Lancaster University&lt;/a&gt; - who also had products to pitch to industry representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the technologies on show at the event were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bbsr.co.uk/" title="Blue Bear Systems Research"&gt;Blue Bear Systems Research Ltd&lt;/a&gt;’s ‘Morphing Wing’ - based on the dynamics of a bird’s wing, this is designed to enable the next generation of unmanned aerial vehicles to be faster, more agile and have greater stability and duration&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dreampact.com/" title="Dreampact Ltd"&gt;Dreampact Ltd&lt;/a&gt;’s compact heat-sensing video camera - a handheld camera that can also be mounted on a rifle to allow more effective surveillance operations in pitch darkness, bad fog or dust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Philip Dunne" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1288/DSC_0837.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Philip Dunne speaks at the inaugural Centre for Defence Enterprise 'Marketplace' event [Picture: Neil Houghton, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Philip Dunne, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s ‘Marketplace’ provides a shop window for small and medium-sized enterprises in the most practical sense, helping those which have received research and development funding from the MOD to access their full potential for commercial applications in the UK defence sector and the export market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Encouraging this technological innovation is vital to our national security and the country’s economic growth. We remain committed to providing our Armed Forces with the very best equipment available, which is why we will continue to invest over £400m a year in Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jono Byrne, Head of the Centre for Defence Enterprise, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today we have broken fresh ground in developing the Department’s engagement with small and medium-sized enterprises and academia. Over half of our contracts go to small and medium-sized enterprises and academia and it is vital that we are able to bring these Centre for Defence Enterprise-funded innovators, their ideas and capabilities, into the defence supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Philip Dunne chats with delegates" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1289/DSC_0941.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Philip Dunne chats with delegates at the Centre for Defence Enterprise 'Marketplace' event [Picture: Neil Houghton, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted with the response and support we have had from prime contractors as they too understand the benefits such a concept can bring. This is only the start for the ‘Marketplace’ and, like all good innovation, I look forward to further improvement; for example, making use of online tools and involving investment companies as well as defence companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Kurth, Managing Director of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.boeing.co.uk/Products-Services/Boeing-Defence-UK" title="Boeing Defence UK"&gt;Boeing Defence UK&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted to attend the inaugural ‘Marketplace’ event and look forward to seeing the areas of technology the Centre for Defence Enterprise has identified in support of our Armed Forces. We see the ‘Marketplace’ as a fantastic opportunity to engage with small and medium-sized enterprises that have relevant innovation and technology for potential work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Defence Enterprise (CDE) is committed to finding new revolutionary ideas and working to make them a reality in the future. Since 2008 the CDE has received more than 4,000 proposals for funding, resulting in around 600 contracts valued at over £35m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mod-contracts-safeguard-hundreds-of-uk-shipyard-jobs"/>
    <title>MOD contracts safeguard hundreds of UK shipyard jobs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contracts cover the long-term maintenance of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Flotilla of naval support ships. They have been awarded to five British companies and will secure a further five years of maintenance support for the 13-strong RFA Flotilla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made up of fuel tankers, stores ships, a medical facility and landing ships, the RFA provides essential support such as food, fuel, munitions and other vital supplies to the Royal Navy at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies involved are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cammell-laird.com/" title="Cammell Laird website"&gt;Cammell Laird Shiprepairers &amp;amp; Shipbuilders Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, based in Birkenhead&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ap-group.co.uk/" title="A&amp;amp;P Group website"&gt;A&amp;amp;P Group Ltd&lt;/a&gt; (ship repair facility), based in Falmouth&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lr.org/default.aspx" title="Lloyd's Register website"&gt;Lloyd’s Register&lt;/a&gt;, based in Bristol&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.trimline.co.uk/" title="Trimline Ltd website"&gt;Trimline Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, based in Southampton&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hempel.com/" title="Hempel UK Ltd website"&gt;Hempel UK Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, based in Cwmbran.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="United States warship alongside RFA Cardigan Bay" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1283/FJ120053055.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;United States warship USS Devastator (left) alongside the Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel Cardigan Bay (library image) [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Ian Simpson, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Philip Dunne, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships are crucial to the work of the Royal Navy and without them it simply could not operate. These substantial contracts will not only safeguard hundreds of UK jobs but will ensure that these ships can continue in their roles for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head of Commercially Supported Shipping for Defence, Equipment and Support, Commodore (RFA) David Preston, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These contracts represent the best value for money for Defence and each of the companies has a proven track record in supporting the Royal Fleet Auxiliary on a worldwide basis. This ability to support the Royal Navy wherever they are deployed is critical to UK Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFA personnel are uniformed civil servants employed under the UK Merchant Shipping Act. They are structurally aligned with the Royal Navy and have a high level of specialist military training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>£25m MOD weapons contract sustains 450 UK jobs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOD has agreed to purchase additional &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/paveway4.cfm" title="Paveway IV"&gt;Paveway IV&lt;/a&gt; bombs from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raytheon.co.uk/" title="Raytheon UK"&gt;Raytheon UK&lt;/a&gt;. These weapons are to be carried by our Tornados in Afghanistan and will also provide a key capability to be carried by the Typhoon and Lightning II aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract announced today will sustain around 450 jobs at Raytheon UK’s plants. It will secure 300 highly skilled defence sector jobs in Glenrothes, Scotland, and 150 in Harlow, Essex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also sustain a number of jobs at Raytheon’s subcontractors - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.portav.com/" title="Portsmouth Aviation"&gt;Portsmouth Aviation Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, Exelis in Brighton, Chemring in Ardeer and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.thalesgroup.com/" title="Thales Group"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt; in Basingstoke, Hampshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paveway IV proved highly effective during the 2011 air campaign over Libya. Its global positioning system technology gives the UK the capability to conduct 24-hour precision attacks against a wide range of targets. Aircrew also have the ability to reprogramme the weapon during a mission, offering capability to attack a wider range of targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Philip Dunne, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This highly sophisticated UK-developed and manufactured weapon is the backbone of the RAF’s precision bombing capability. This contract to boost the MOD’s weapon stocks will sustain hundreds of skilled jobs in the defence manufacturing sector in both Scotland and England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By balancing the Defence Budget, we are able to commit with confidence to equipment programmes which help to safeguard our national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Baz North, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paveway munitions have long been a success story for the Royal Air Force in terms of their precision bombing capability. The ability to operate in any weather means that we are able to support operations 24/7. Paveway IV weapons are a real asset, not only to the Royal Air Force, but also to Defence as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the MOD has this year awarded contracts worth more than £100m to Raytheon for orders of around 1,600 Paveway IV bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/12/03 - Centre for Defence Enterprise Marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning to everyone, and thank you Richard [Brooks] for that kind introduction. I am very pleased that so many people have been able to make it here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting moment for the Centre for Defence Enterprise (&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched by the previous Government in 2008 as a delivery mechanism for allowing better access for technology &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; (Small and Medium Enterprises) to defence research and ultimately the wider Defence Market, I see the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; now as helping the Ministry of Defence achieve two principle goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;firstly to act as the entry point for new science and technology innovation bringing new thinking and ideas to Defence &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and secondly to act as a key bridge linking &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; to the main defence suppliers, as well as investors and wider Government, as part of the MOD’s priority to raise participation by &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in defence procurement &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; calls for, receives and assesses research proposals. It then funds, supports and promotes projects that it regards as plausible with potential to meet defence needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It encourages innovative companies to address Defence issues through face to face surgeries, unclassified and open conferences, and through its innovative electronic contracting portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this activity is run from a small base in a commercial office block at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. One of &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s strengths is its fleetness of foot, born of a lean and efficient structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; was set up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To provide visibility of the MOD’s requirements &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To inform and support new supply networks that widen the MOD’s supplier base &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And above all to get the best and most innovative ideas into MOD’s Science and Technology Programme &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks another important milestone of the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;. A new turn in &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s evolving journey to discover innovation, and then help in the realisation of those ideas into defence and security capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what innovation has been discovered. In the last four years the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; has received nearly 4,000 proposals for funding, resulting in some 600 contracts, worth around £35 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few projects have made it directly into the hands of users, but that is an exception for most research work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we want to see those &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities who have successfully demonstrated innovative technology, to have the chance to present their capabilities to our prime contractors - boosting their prospects of being taken into the supply chain. And that’s what today’s marketplace is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some amazing ideas and technologies which have been developed by the innovators we have funded. I hope you will be able to stay and hear the details today, some of which are also on view in the exhibition downstairs on the second floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="exhibition-examples"&gt;Exhibition Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward shortly to going round this exhibition, and to meeting the people who are working to deliver innovative battle winning capabilities which support the front line. And I encourage you all to look around if you have the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example, on display downstairs is Blue Bear Systems Research and their morphing wing for small Unmanned Air Vehicles based on the dynamics of a bird wing. This project exploits the design work already done by Mother Nature, to help ensure our next generation of UAVs can be both faster and more agile, as well as having greater endurance when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the compact, high performance heat sensing video camera developed by Dreampact, which can be handheld or rifle mounted for surveillance or gunsight use in conditions of total darkness, fog, smoke or dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our universities are also represented today with ingenious electronics and autonomously learning logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the projects featured demonstrate the ingenuity and practical focus of the &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities that we are working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging this technological innovation to flourish is vital to our national security and our prosperity, contributing to export led recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="wider-st-policy"&gt;Wider S&amp;amp;T Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my new role I have responsibility also for Defence exports as well as procurement, so encouraging responsible Defence exports is a particular priority for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is partly to stimulate this growth which is why the MOD has protected its annual investment in Science and Technology at 1.2% of the Defence Budget - over £400 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is protecting this budget so important? Well, in a future that is so unpredictable, defence science and technology provides insurance against the future threats and conflicts we may face; and supports the MOD’S ability to be an intelligent customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our defence transformation programme transfers responsibility for primary equipment procurement to the Commands, each will need to build capability to look forward to its future needs. This will better align our science and technology spend to the research and development priorities of our front line commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence is about developing Armed Forces and Defence capability that can deal with a broad range of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our blueprint for agile, adaptable Armed Forces is Future Force 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be effective Future Force 2020 must have the best equipment available: class leading platforms, complex weapon systems and supporting ISTAR assets. Our personnel need the best training and personal equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector and our world class academic institutions will be central to deliver this Future Force. The complexity of much of these platforms needs, by necessity, substantial industrial capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From cyber, to space, to nano technology, Britain has world leading companies underpinned by world leading scientific research, some of which I have already seen helping our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A profitable and high tech British Defence and Security sector is essential to achieving all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many of the platform projects will be managed through large system level contracts by our Prime contractors, there will be numerous participants in the supply chain, from large companies, to academia, to &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="smes"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; make an enormous contribution to the economy and in particular to innovation. And I want to take a moment to emphasise their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; are not the only source of original thinking in our sector, but they often provide the niche expertise which can lead to breakthroughs in defence applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I know that The Centre for Defence Enterprise has already done some excellent work in supporting &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in this area, helping them to commercialise their high tech ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank my predecessor, Peter Luff, who I am delighted to see is with us today. Peter did much to champion Science and Technology, the crucial role of Small and medium sized enterprises to delivering innovation, and to starting the conversation that led to this event today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, like him, am a champion of the &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; doing innovative work in the Defence and Security sector. They are the lifeblood of any sector. In defence they deliver innovation, flexibility, efficiency and agility, when responding to our requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential that &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; - whose issues are often very different from those of Primes - have their own platform within the defence industry to engage with the Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why I chair a dedicated &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprise"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; Forum which addresses the concerns of smaller companies, and why the MOD is taking a significant number of steps, alongside wider Government to work to ensure &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; can reach their potential when responding to defence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD has a detailed action plan, led by our &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprise"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; Champion, Les Mosco, who will be talking to you later today, to drive forward &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprise"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; involvement in defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have addressed some really important issues such as the treatment of IPR for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify issues that MoD needs to address and which the &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; themselves need to think about too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are encouraging our prime contractors to inform us of the part &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; play in their own supply chain and I have personally invited the Chief Executives of our top twenty suppliers to attend today’s event - and I am particularly pleased to see some of them here today and I am grateful for the leadership they are showing at the senior level in support of &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach to &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;, even to a business as small as a one-man band, is to support, not stifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cde"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final word about &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;. Since its launch the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; has established a reputation for reaching out across a very wide spectrum of the engineering and scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; has worked closely with the Technology Strategy Board and benefited through working with its Knowledge Transfer Networks and Small Business Research Initiative and I am glad to see that Mark Glover from TSB is here today to see the blossoming fruits of this collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But above all else, it is you, the defence and security community, that shaped the advances that we see within in the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; today. Thank you for your strong support of the &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; started off as pilot scheme. And four years on it has become a going concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But innovation never stops, there is always something new to try, something that can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now an exciting new phase has begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our White Paper ‘National Security through Technology’ committed Government to broaden &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;’s remit to cover both the defence and security domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 3rd October, here in this building, &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; held its first event for GCHQ and MI5. This attracted over 300 &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and resulted in over 170 proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘National Security through Technology’ also committed &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; to provide more support to &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how MOD and National Security operates &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development of routes to market for potential defence and security products; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to enhance exploitation mechanisms between &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt;, the wider MOD and our suppliers &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising fears expressed by &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; in the consultation, we committed to keep &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; small and agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am most grateful that Richard Brooks, the Programme Director for MOD’s Science and Technology Programme who is here organising this day, is ensuring that &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; is not distracted or inhibited by bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whilst staff numbers have grown, &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; remains small and agile with only 12 staff, yet now able to run more research calls, more seminars and more workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means that &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; can hold more regular surgeries - ‘one to ones’ - where individuals and companies can get personalised guidance on what the MoD is looking for, and practical help on how to pitch an idea to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; was set a target of 150 one-to-one appointments for this financial year. This figure will be passed before the end of this month and &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; now expects to hold more than 200 such appointments by the end of the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="marketplace"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our science and technology budget, we fund &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; to work on specific projects for us. They keep the intellectual property rights for their work, and can develop them however they want, once they have completed their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the effort so far has been focussed on the engagement of &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities and supporting the best ideas with proof of concept funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we want to help more - which brings us, finally, to today’s Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all this event is a start, and I look forward to seeing this idea develop and innovate rapidly like all the best &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for those of you, &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;, universities and Prime Contractors, who have contributed already to the thinking of how today’s Marketplace will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our aim is an MOD-facilitated initiative whereby &lt;abbr title="Centre for Defence Enterprise"&gt;CDE&lt;/abbr&gt; gives &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; and universities, who have successfully demonstrated their credibility and capability, the opportunity to present their innovations and capabilities to the UK’s key defence suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing this opportunity, the MOD is seeking to ensure that these &lt;abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; will have an increased probability of development funding and mentoring, so that they can fully develop their ideas into products suitable for the defence, security or other civilian markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view is that the MOD does have an important role to play in helping to maintain a dynamic pool of innovation which can drive defence applications forward and lead to economic benefits for the whole nation, beyond the immediate Defence objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we will only get this by leaving companies free to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And free to work together. So today is all about bringing people together. Then it is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to take a couple of questions before we move downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/05/23 - The Strategic Challenges of Defence Acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the Defence Secretary spoke about PR12 marking a new chapter in the long history of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s absolutely right. Balancing the budget is a key part of transforming Defence and making sure we have a Defence Equipment Programme based on firm foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m well aware there may be some here who may be sceptical that this vast programme of change - the root and branch reform of something as large and complex as defence - will succeed. Or indeed actually happen at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should it work this time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well - there are four reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these is the economic imperative, and a series of events which have led us to this moment. In the foreword to the SDSR the Prime Minister said that bringing the defence budget back to balance is a vital part of how we tackle the  national deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you aren’t convinced by that, just think for a moment about the implications of the gathering storm over the Eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is political will - a determination and commitment which comes from the very top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third - this is a process which is gathering momentum on a daily basis. The winds of change are blowing across Defence and across the Armed Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And fourth, there is a growing recognition that everyone has a part to play in this process. And a universal wish - in fact , a real drive - to succeed and see MOD taken off ‘special measures’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now see a general recognition that there is no turning back. Top down meets bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No return to the so called good old days with MOD merrily pushing out fantasy budgets, whipping out a blank cheque book and starting ill-tested projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects which hadn’t a hope of seeing the light of day because, actually, there was no funding in place to ever pay for them.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few deluded dissidents, including in industry, seem to yearn for the best forgotten past, but must understand that there will be a heavy price to pay if we don’t grasp this opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A failure to act now would mean a toxic legacy for the future. And wwould threaten both the security and prosperity of our nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s a burden which would be shared by future generations of servicemen and women who won’t have the best high tech cutting edge capabilities and solutions. Because we just couldn’t - or wouldn’t - get our act together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indulge me for a moment here in one of my other passions. And let me cite the words of one man who puts this a lot better than I ever could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar is one of my favourite plays. It encapsulates so much about life’s dilemmas, conflict and the human condition. About politics, and indeed war.  Albeit a civil one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Act 4 Brutus and Cassius are discussing the final phase of their civil war with the forces of Octavian and Marcus Antonius. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassius says they should group their forces and take advantage of the secure location to catch their breath. Brutus urges that no - they must act immediately while they have the advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brutus says:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tide in the affairs of men.&lt;br&gt;
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; &lt;br&gt;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life&lt;br&gt;
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.&lt;br&gt;
On such a full sea are we now afloat,&lt;br&gt;
And we must take the current when it serves,&lt;br&gt;
Or lose our ventures.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumstances have created just such a tide and all of us are now afloat on a full sea. But unlike Brutus we will succeed.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="white-paper-pr12-defence-transformation-materiel-strategy--equipment-plan"&gt;White Paper, PR12, Defence Transformation, Materiel Strategy &amp;amp; Equipment Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we are to ensure success, more needs to be done. We have the advantage - but we need to do more to maintain it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the  building blocks are in place.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One. The White Paper ‘National Security Through Technology’ has set out our principles on an open approach to procurement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means buying off the shelf where possible, a commitment to opening up more business to SMEs, building in exportability at an early stage. And strong support for exports, as well as a floor in the MOD’s annual Science and Technology budget.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two. PR12 means we can now plan for the future with a certainty that we just couldn’t before as we continued to wrestle with a huge deficit and legacy of overspend.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you are aware, our announcement last week guaranteed the delivery of a number of projects for the Navy, Army and RAF.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted also be able to confirm the establishment of an Armoured Vehicle Pipeline, which provides significant funding for the Warrior Upgrade, Challenger Life Extension, a Utility Vehicle and the Scout programme which is now well into its Demonstration Phase.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pipeline approach enables us to keep a firm control of costs,  numbers, performance and sequencing in order to remain within the allocated profile. The Army, as the end user, will be intimately involved in this process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Scout, a world-class family of reconnaissance vehicles to which we are now committed, we will first need to reset the programme in order to remain within the pipeline profile. We will then drive hard to a Main Gate 2, when we will finalise production numbers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves the final three building blocks of success. Defence Transformation, The Materiel Strategy and the publication of the Equipment Plan.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Levene’s  Defence Reform recommended devolving most capability planning and resourcing to Front Line Commands -  FLCs - and in turn  a smaller, more strategic and stronger Head Office.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less of the long screwdriver from Head Office - and a lot more giving the FLCs a real opportunity to control their own destinies.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant change like this won’t happen overnight. We expect to roll out these changes gradually with an initial operating capability for this model in place for the 2013/14 financial year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we embed this new approach I’d ask industry to work closely with the Front Line Commands during this crucial transition process.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of the White Paper will also apply to Front Line Commands:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance they must ask themselves what are the capabilities where we require operational advantage and freedom of action?-  what steps should we take to protect these elements?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we embed open systems and exportability into our procurement processes; and   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we make sure SMEs get access to defence opportunities at an early stage?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am under no illusion that this represents a considerable  challenge for the FLCs - not least to ensure they have the right skills in place as they take on this new responsibility, and accountability.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have heard just now from Chris Deverell about ongoing work on the Materiel Strategy, the fourth component of success.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you here from industry will be aware that we intend to be a more demanding customer - improving skills and processes at Abbey Wood will ensure we are able to deliver on that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 2012 will see us announce our 10 Year Equipment Plan after careful scrutiny from the NAO - all funded and accounted for, not just in terms of acquisition but also support costs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fifth component of success will give industry the transparency which they quite understandably, have been pressing for.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that comparisons are still being made with the Defence Industrial Strategy of 2005 - and its much heralded announcement at the time of a 10 year equipment plan.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know this plan never materialised, for the simple fact that, like the Strategy itself, there was no funding plan behind it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we are now in very different place.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a balanced budget and a core equipment programme of £152 billion over 10 years, against a total planned spend of almost £160 billion. That £152 billion includes, for the first time, a centrally held contingency of over £4 billion.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme also includes an additional £8 billion of funding over the next ten years which is unallocated. This means that the budget will have guaranteed headroom which can be allocated to projects as military priorities change.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will open up opportunities to suppliers who are agile, and able to respond with mature products and services as these new opportunities arise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think , by the way, that we know what we are likely to spend this headroom on. But - it wouldn’t surprise me if we look back in ten years time and discover that changing priorities and technologies had led to very different outcomes.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all set to go. Or are we? What are the factors which might hold us back?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know there are a lot of institutional, governmental and political challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is one main challenge relevant to this audience as far as I am concerned and that is a failure by industry to recognise -  and possibly seize - the opportunities coming your way.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uk-france"&gt;UK-France&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take UK-France collaboration.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portfolio of Franco-British programmes sets out to deliver a wide range of capabilities. There’s now real momentum behind this relationship. To some extent we are drawing on each others strengths. And aiming to avoid duplicating capabilities where we don’t need to.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10 year strategic plan for the British and French Complex Weapons Industries encapsulates this.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are real benefits here from our common position on this sector when it comes to budgets, as well as similar military and industry requirements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the two most capable military powers in Europe, we will look to strengthening our ties with the new French administration to address common security challenges facing both countries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a relationship which has developed around a change of administration here in the UK.  And it is a relationship which will continue to deepen after the recent change in France.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all changes there are risks and opportunities that we will need to address.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do our bit - but we do need industry to engage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK/France Critical Technologies Study is a case in point where we need you to present a consolidated view. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the White Paper makes clear, we need to focus investment on the ‘critical outcomes’ of what science and technology should achieve, rather than a list of ‘critical technologies’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There needs to be a methodology to do this so we can identify, assess and prioritise as criticalities emerge - and we need industry to contribute to this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve seen - and it’s certainly become very clear in the UK/France High Level Working Group which I co - chair  - is that  French companies are being very proactive when it comes to  getting involved in UK-France equipment collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration is an important principle of the White Paper because it’s essentially about mutual benefit. There are just as many opportunities for our own industrial base.  But you really do have to seize the initiative on this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know many of you think that our industrial policy is radically different from that of France. Well, perhaps it is. But I believe that collaboration will only evolve if it can be seen to bring benefits to both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I need your views and ideas on potential opportunities that you see would benefit UK plc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="industrial-offset-and-smes"&gt;Industrial offset and SMEs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And talking about opportunities, I want to say a word here about the issue of offset, and how it impacts on British industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an issue that’s been raised with me on a number of occasions recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offset is a significant challenge to UK exporters, particularly SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while there is limited scope for Government to provide practical help, we will do what we can and work with industry to try and identify measures which help to ease the offset burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reverse of this was, as some of you will be aware, our Industrial Participation Policy which we comprehensively reviewed last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was done in the lead up to the publication of the White Paper in February, and was undertaken in liaison with industry members from the UK Offset Strategy Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review factored in the changes that have been going on in the global offset market place in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the review has resulted in a new Defence and Security Industrial Engagement Policy which remains compatible with our obligations under EU law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this encourages our overseas based suppliers to continue investing in the UK’s defence and security sectors, and to extend opportunities for UK companies to become part of their supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means we will encourage our overseas based suppliers to engage with SMEs in these activities, as they did through our industrial participation policy. And the evidence so far is that they are more than willing to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Boeing are engaging with hundreds of UK suppliers where SMEs are found at every level of the supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing has over 350 UK suppliers providing parts, services and technology to platforms such as the Chinook and 787. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="supply-chain-and-smes"&gt;Supply Chain and SMEs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you’re all pretty aware by now that I’m a determined champion of SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are definitely the innovators of the Defence supply chain, and the life blood of any successful industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up more opportunities for them is one of the deliverables of the White Paper. And a key challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very heartened by the way some of the Primes are engaging with these smaller businesses in such a creative way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I visited General Dynamic in Wales where they have a dedicated technical facility known as The Edge, which searches out new ideas from across the supply chain and academia.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just a couple of weeks ago I attended a ‘Meet The Technologist’ event at UKTI, a kind of speed dating event organised by Lockheed Martin who flew over some of their leading experts from the States to hook up with SMEs back here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rather telling that it’s Primes from overseas who seem to be energised when it comes to exploiting this innovation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder - is there any reason why our domestic primes don’t seem to be showing the same leadership and commitment? Perhaps they are - and they’re just not telling me about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is - and this is my challenge to you - that one of the ways I’ll be evaluating companies will be on the quality of their engagement with the SME supply chain, because to me that flag ups innovation and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find very interesting about many of these smaller companies is the way SMEs are increasingly establishing themselves by selling to the export market and then marketing themselves back here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re hungry, they’re aggressive and they’re not afraid to get out there and pitch for the business. It’s the key to success and I relish their enthusaism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked today about a new chapter for Defence. And about the challenges for industry in this new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new era in which Defence is a tougher and more pragmatic customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also a time when Defence will have to be a more informed and intelligent customer. And we’ve just been hearing about the changes needed to take forward the Materiel Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="total-support-force"&gt;Total Support Force&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be hearing a lot more today about the nature of this challenge. And it will be very interesting to get the perspective of the Front Line Commands themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course transformation and changing the way we do things also brings other opportunities for industry. And there’s one in particular that will now demand greater attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Support Force - TSF - with contractors having a crucial role to play as part of a fully integrated force structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re very keen that they’re involved at the earliest opportunity in Op Herrick drawdown and other capability regeneration plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD, in close liaison with Industry, has continued to build upon the success of Contractor Support to Operations. In fact, there are currently over 5,000 contractors directly supporting operations in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very encouraging that Industry is taking an active and positive role in the development of the Total Support Force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The services, together with other areas of Defence, have been working to identify a number of identified a number of potential Total Support Force initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’re engaging with industry - directly, and through ADS -   in the work to decide what will be brought to market and how. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areas under consideration include equipment support activities currently largely delivered by the REME, as well as some new ideas on airfield support activities, possibly allied to Project Future Brize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that balancing the books has not been easy. It has - quite rightly - been a forensic process and it has taken some time. It’s taken the SDSR, two planning rounds, a three month exercise and then some. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, although I enjoyed the comment, the Daily Telegraph wasn’t quite right when it said that we had fed the 5000, cleared the Agean stable and solved the Schleswig-Holstein question all in a single day; it has actually taken two years.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to get Defence back onto a firm footing so that we could look to the future and get on with the job. And there is more work to do to ensure the footing is really secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also remember that the job of delivering military success on operations, which is , after all what Defence is all about. And which remains our number one priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the money, and how we use it, matters. As Chris Deverell’s presentation makes clear, only by looking after the bottom line can we make sure we’re achieving our real objective of looking after the front line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/05/01 - Helicopter Capability Industry Briefing Day</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you, for that kind welcome from Paul and his team here in Yeovilton. [Paul Chivers CO Yeovilton]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you to [Kevin and] ADS for organising this event with Wayne’s team in the MOD. [Commodore Wayne Keble, Head of Air Littoral Manoeuvre Capability] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADS does a great job championing this sector, and playing an active role in both the Suppliers Forum as well as the SME Forum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that ADS - and indeed many others here - have contributed to the Defence Rotary Wing Capability Study which you’ll be hearing more about later on from Wayne and his team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also most grateful to Agusta Westland, Rockwell Collins and Lockheed Martin for their kind sponsorship of today’s event - today wouldn’t be possible without you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would of course be speaking to you here today in a post PR12 world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very aware that many of you are waiting for this level of direction to inform your planning and decision making in the months ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s regrettable that our discussions today won’t be able to have that level of detail. I can assure you though that we are nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is plenty to talk about when it comes to this sector. And I’m confident that our White Paper ‘National Security Through Technology’ has provided clarity on MOD’s approach to acquisition and support. More about that later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="helicopter-availability-in-theatre---tribute-to-industry"&gt;Helicopter availability in theatre - tribute to industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago ‘helicopter availability’ was a pretty loaded term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helicopters were very definitely a bad news story for defence -back in 2009 it seemed that barely a day went by without gloomy media headlines denouncing a lack of helicopters in Afghanistan, and claims that this shortage was undermining our operational effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years on and I’m delighted to say that we’re now looking at a very different picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Afghanistan earlier this year visiting Lashkhar Gar and Bastion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to travel on a range of helicopters, (including by the way an Osprey, if an Osprey is really a helicopter) to talk to the crews, and visit Joint Helicopter Force there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was impressed - and very heartened - by the availability and capability of UK airframes.  And this was also borne out by Commanders I spoke to on the ground.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work being done by the Chinooks responding to medical emergencies, for example, is just incredibly humbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the workhorses of the skies being flown by incredibly courageous crews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that we have enough of these vital assets performing at  an optimum level on a daily basis is - I believe - a testimony to the improved and effective partnership working of defence and industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week on the Terrace of the House of Commons I met members of the Royal Navy and RAF who had been involved in Op Ellamy over and near Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among them were the deck hands of HMS Ocean who got the Apache helicopters off and safely home - black helicopters on a black deck on a black night on a black sea.  Not an easy job with blades whirling, weapons loaded and adrenalin pumping. But what a job those Apaches did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their story really brought home to me once again just how critical rotary power is for our operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s delivering freedom of movement and logistic support, or providing close combat support and an evacuation capability.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of our fleet to operate in these hostile and dangerous environments is - I believe - in very large part due to the hard work and commitment of the companies here in this room today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can still do more, and it is your technological innovation that is helping us to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you will be aware of the very successful cooperation between DSTL, Ferranti, Elbit and Agusta Westland to develop a product to help crews during brown-out landings, which remain one of the biggest risks to helicopter operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that others are actively pursuing solutions in this area too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooperative investigation has been very successful so far and I very much hope that we will be able to build on this research to provide our pilots with a solution in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="industry-support-to-uors"&gt;Industry support to UORs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your responsiveness has been particularly striking on the UOR front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agusta Westland’s upgraded Lynx Mk9a has been a real success. We now have a vastly more capable airframe able to cope with the demanding environment of Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 helicopters delivered to the front line in just 18 months was an enormous achievement - and the now fully converted fleet is continuing to turn in a star performance in theatre with over 4,000 hours flown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to some of the air crew in person when I was in Bastion. They raved about it. And they can’t wait for Wildcat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all UORs are on this scale, but they are just as important - the kind of emergency practical stuff that’s so essential for keeping our fleet airworthy and effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protective floor covering on Chinook and Merlin used on the Medical Emergency Response Team flights, for example, took just 10 weeks to be fitted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s 10 weeks, by the way, from initial concept and drawing board stage to deployment in theatre. A terrific achievement , and one that is helping ensure this life saving capability is maintained. A match indeed for Brunel’s mobile theatre for the Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rotary-wing-capability-study"&gt;Rotary Wing Capability Study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotary power is an absolutely critical component of combat power. That’s why the Defence Rotary Wing Capability Study - or Derrick as I believe it’s known colloquially - is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know the study was initiated by VCDS in the wake of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially the study has been looking at capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And taking a long hard look at issues such as basing, force structures, command and control - and of course military helicopter flying training from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, you’ll be hearing more about the conclusions and recommendations of the study from Wayne and his team today -  particularly on areas such as training and simulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you here today will have been personally involved in the study so I’ve no doubt there will be a lot to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am confident that the study will help to provide industry with direction and clarity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defence-white-paper"&gt;Defence White Paper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I hope that our White Paper ‘National Security Through Technology’ also provides insight into how MOD sees the future, and the changes we need to make to ensure we have a balanced and affordable equipment programme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this means we’ll be adopting an Open Procurement policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means buying off the shelf wherever possible and when appropriate. Where we need technological advantage for security we will maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means collaboration with friends and allies wherever possible. The UK-France Defence Co-operation Treaty is a tangible example of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a partnership which continues to mature and develop, and the consolidation of the Complex Weapons programme under MBDA is a demonstration that we’re definitely in this for the long term. And it’s a partnership that must bring benefit to both sides. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Procurement also means a commitment to opening up more MOD business to SMEs - organisations which bring innovation and agility to our equipment programme, and which are already winning a sizeable proportion of defence contracts. Changing technology makes this commitment ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies are already making an important contribution to this sector - I’m thinking here of companies like Wallop Defence Industries, involved in providing the flares we use to counter MANPADS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper has been described as ‘pragmatic’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. It was meant to be and it has to be. We have to get the right solution for the Armed Forces at the best possible price for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes this means it’s sometimes better to do work outside of the UK - elements of the Puma life extension programme are being undertaken in Romania and France rather than on these shores. And actually that was a decision taken by the last government and one I am entirely comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why, for example, we took the decision to build our 14 new Chinooks on Boeing’s Philadelphia production line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are those of you in the audience that would have liked to have seen these built right here in Somerset. And you made a strong argument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I visited the Boeing factory last year I was left in no doubt that the scale of the operation already in place means that best value for money and lowest risk can only be delivered from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the realities of Defence procurement in 2012. Of course I would love every penny Defence has to stay in the UK, but apart from anything else, if we want the world to buy our products and services - which we do - we have to be prepared to use theirs when it is right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defence-industrial-engagement---and-the-defence-industrial-strategy-2005"&gt;Defence Industrial engagement - and the Defence Industrial Strategy (2005)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But has it not ever been so? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…it is important to be clear that we will continue to look to the vibrant and competitive global market place to satisfy our future helicopter requirement…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds rather 2012, white paper in the age of austerity, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s anything but.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this text is lifted from page 94 of Lord Drayson’s 2005 Defence Industrial Strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DIS contained many commendable aspirations. Most of them were, however, unfunded, which meant it was always going to be something of a wish list - and certainly became one as economic realities unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it had a pretty clear and realistic position on helicopters reflected in the reality of Wildcats assembled just down the road in Yeovil, Pumas modified in mainland Europe and Chinooks being built in America. And, as I saw yesterday at RAF Benson, increasingly effective support for the Merlin fleet in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand you want clarity on industrial engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hope you’ll agree that actually when it comes to this sector, there has been an enduring policy in place for a number of years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see no enduring reason why a competitive British defence industry shouldn’t win business in this sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And making you, the Defence industry, more competitive is a central theme of the White paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Government committed without reservation to building an environment conducive to responsible Defence exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why we are doing so much to support the SME base, where innovation and flexibility offer us a dynamic that the Primes cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why I have for the first time put a floor under the science budget, to ensure that as a nation we remain at the forefront of cutting edge, battle-winning technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper is realistic, but it is deliverable. And I firmly believe it should give you more - not less - confidence in the Department as we go forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="industrial-base---the-offset-issue"&gt;Industrial base - the offset issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And staying on the industrial theme, I want to say a word here about the issue of what was once known as industrial offset, and the challenge this poses for UK SMEs when exporting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an issue that’s been raised with me on a number of occasions recently - and quite seriously misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some of you here will be aware, the MOD conducted a comprehensive review of our previous Industrial Participation policy last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was done in the lead up to the publication of the White Paper in February, and was undertaken in liaison with industry members from the UK Offset Strategy Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review factored in the changes that have been going on in the global offset market place in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also acknowledged the challenges faced by UK exporters who are increasingly being asked to fulfil stringent offset obligations, particularly in new and emerging defence markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the review has resulted in a new Defence and Security Industrial Engagement Policy which remains compatible with our obligations under EU law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this encourages our overseas based suppliers to continue investing in the UK’s defence and security sectors, and extending opportunities for UK companies to become part of their supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means we will encourage our overseas based suppliers to engage with SMEs in these activities. And the evidence so far is that they are more than willing to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Boeing are sourcing key components for the 14 new Chinooks from UK SMEs and will be basing through life support work in the UK - which will provide further opportunities through the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="looking-ahead---our-helicopter-fleet"&gt;Looking ahead - our helicopter fleet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDSR clearly set out our long term plans for a helicopter fleet based on four core platforms from 2025 - the post Herrick era as I’ve heard it referred to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These platforms are already part of the rotary lexicon: Apache, Merlin, Chinook and Wildcat. I am pleased to say that we have recently secured the release to service for the first Wildcat to start Army training - I look forward to seeing this aircraft this afternoon. And we are looking at options to upgrade the Merlin Mk3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will still need Puma until the future changes can be made and that is why we committed to complete the Life Extension Plan in SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that of course means that there is currently no medium term MOD requirement for a new UK developed airframe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are opportunities here in the civilian market and BIS are taking a very active role in helping the sector in that diversification process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year BIS announced £32 million of government investment in helicopter production, research and development which will provide an important boost to Agusta Westland, for instance in the introduction of the civil AW169 aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that, when it comes to future defence work, the opportunities for many of you here will lie in support and training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping the Wildcat flying should sustain hundreds of engineering and technical jobs at Agusta Westland and here in Yeovilton over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And looking ahead there will be opportunities for industry to contribute to our Total Force Support concept which will include a sizeable number of contractors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know there’s more you can be doing when it comes to providing expert support on the ground - in fact this sector is already leading the way, with Vector Aerospace and Boeing UK deploying engineers in theatre doing vital work keeping our Chinooks airborne. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the best way to sustain jobs in the long term will be to widen your customer base. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why supporting exports is another principle of the White Paper, and why we’ve also appointed Susana Mason to co-ordinate exports on the MOD side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re providing Ministerial support across Government for rotary wing opportunities - particularly the AW101 and AW159 Wildcat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are worldwide export opportunities for Wildcat, with specific interest from other Lynx operating nations such as Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the word pragmatic earlier on to describe our approach to making sure we have a balanced and affordable equipment programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s an approach I would also commend to all of you in this sector as your companies plan and invest for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, while defence here in the UK may be a shrinking market, there are plenty of other opportunities out there - in the civilian sector as well as overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversification will be the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve covered quite a lot of ground here this morning - and I hope I’ve addressed some of the issues that I know those of you here from industry have been seeking clarity on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/03/28 - Editorial Intelligence Comment Conference ‘The Manufacturing Economy’</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an economist with a passion for engineering I welcome Editorial Intelligence’s initiative in organising today’s event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a truism but it needs to be said - especially by ministers. The role and contribution of manufacturing in today’s global economy is central to us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this morning’s session has centred on the producer’s view - the industry perspective - of the manufacturing economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the challenges and opportunities companies face in a globalised and technological age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-manufacturing"&gt;The importance of manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’ve also discussed the challenge of inspiring young people to get involved in production and manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I feel passionately about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply can’t understand the constant hand wringing in this country about the state of our manufacturing industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gloomy assertions that we don’t - and can’t - make anything any more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the endless claims that in any event the whole process of manufacturing somehow ‘doesn’t count’, and is irrelevant to our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes my blood boil, because all this unhelpful armchair criticism just doesn’t reflect the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if anyone here saw Evan Davies’s excellent TV programme last year on UK manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did a great job in exploding the urban myth that Britain is no longer an industrial nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain - he correctly argued - could not actually survive without its vital manufacturing industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is, in fact, still a manufacturing powerhouse with upwards of four million people still making everything from high-tech aircraft to supercars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are people employed in a sector which is - in economic terms - twice as big as financial services. In fact, manufacturing accounts for half UK exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be talking later about the role of the defence industry in our manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What concerns me about this endless talking ourselves down and the gloomy media headlines is that it all becomes something of a self fulfilling prophesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And - worryingly - acts as a disincentive to young people who might otherwise consider working in industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a real problem. And I see it all the time in the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge demand in this country for well qualified people with the right engineering, scientific and technical skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand is there - but the people aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are subjects which just haven’t been popular options in recent years. And of course there continues to be a noticeable lack of women working in these roles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons behind the recent decision to allow women to serve in Royal Navy submarines is the possibility that we can attract people from the widest pool of talent and skills into the Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies I deal with tell me that these skills shortages are having a direct impact on their growth and productivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got to take steps to reverse this process of decline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And make sure that being an engineer is an attractive proposition. And that it’s a career choice which carries the same status as being a doctor or a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just an issue for Government or industry. The manufacturing sector matters to our wider economy, to our communities. And to our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, nurturing and developing this talent at an early stage is one particularly effective way of developing our skills base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD runs a range of civilian craft and technician apprenticeships across the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Armed Forces as a whole are the largest providers of apprenticeships across the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAE Systems, one of today’s sponsors, are particularly successful in this area when it comes to development. They are renowned for their huge pull through of apprenticeships to senior management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’re all in agreement that developing our skills base is going to be an essential driver of our economy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have also been talking this morning about the need for growth. And how innovation is central to this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m here to talk about the manufacturing economy from the perspective of one of its major customers. The Ministry of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be outlining some of the changes we’re making in our approach to buying equipment - in particular our commitment to making the MOD more accessible for SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about our determination to become a more intelligent and demanding customer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-defence-industry---a-vibrant-sector"&gt;The Defence industry - A vibrant sector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence industry is one of the UK’s most vibrant sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facts speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an industry currently supporting around 300,000 jobs in this country - many of them in advanced engineering, an area in which this country has such a distinguished tradition and strong track record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take aerospace for example - a great example of an R&amp;amp;D intensive, high tech industry with technological spin offs to the rest of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has the largest aerospace industry in Europe, and the second largest in the world after the USA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK aerospace has a turnover of £23 billion. Defence accounts for just over half of that - 52% to be precise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this country is the second largest defence exporter in the world, with £6 billion of annual sales and a 22% share of the global market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, with the fourth biggest defence budget in the world, the Ministry of Defence is - even in these straitened times - a customer with a lot of spending power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a government department we are also a customer that is accountable to the taxpayer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure defence has an equipment programme which is balanced and affordable is important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of both national and defence austerity it’s absolutely vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="materiel-strategy"&gt;Materiel Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that this government inherited a Ministry of Defence with a gaping deficit - and an equipment programme in financial freefall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A programme based on the kind of fantasy budgets that I know many of you here from the corporate sector would find it pretty hard to countenance. Or even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working hard to balance the books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it will not be long before we can announce our plans for PR12, and the equipment plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a grip of this gaping deficit - and we have - has meant, and will mean, driving forward change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It calls for a new mindset. And a very different approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means defence has to become a more intelligent and demanding customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that means taking a long hard look at our processes, and the way we do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upping our game when it comes to having the right skills in areas like financial and project management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it calls for significant changes in Defence Equipment and Support - DE&amp;amp;S as it is known - the organisation outside Bristol which heads up our acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Materiel Strategy, as it’s being called, aims to transform DE&amp;amp;S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure it has the relationships, structures, management and skills it needs to provide the right equipment to our Armed Forces. At the right time and at the right cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have looked at a number of options and we have pretty well already ruled out the status quo. I have already said in public that there have been three options judged most appropriate for further consideration: Trading Fund, Executive Non-Departmental Body and a Government-Owned Contractor-Operated organisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have extensive experience of running Trading Funds - for example the Met Office and DSTL- and so the DE &amp;amp; S has now begun a soft market testing exercise to obtain further information from the private sector about the other options to help inform our decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would just stress here that no decisions have yet been taken on this, although we intend to have a clear idea later this year on the best option to take forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="white-paper"&gt;White Paper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be changing our processes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re already changing our approach to acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s necessary for us - and it’s essential for industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because the defence industry - any industry in fact -  has to be competitive if it’s to thrive in today’s global economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re making sure this change happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month we launched our White Paper - ‘National Security Through Technology’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plan of action for defence which commits us to adopting a new, open procurement approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, pretty much what it says on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means we’ll be seeking to fulfill defence requirements through open competition in the domestic and global market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means buying off the shelf if that represents the best value for money - which it often will. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason why a competitive British defence industry shouldn’t win that business. Recent history - for example the Foxhound protected mobility vehicle or the Sea Ceptor missile system - shows it generally does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also thinking here of a company like Mabey Bridge Company, which is based in South Wales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mabey is a world leader when it comes to pre-fabricated bridge systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have won a number of contracts to supply logistic support bridging to our Forces in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when British Army engineers took on construction of a 140 tonne bridge to connect two Afghan communities in Helmand -  the biggest bridge our soldiers have built since World War 2 - it was Mabey who won the contract. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And “modified off the shelf” - buying a platform that’s freely available on the British or international market and then integrating it with, say, electronic counter measures or communication equipment here in the UK - ensures vital system skills are maintained in our domestic manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open procurement means actively looking for ways to collaborate, preferably bilaterally, with other countries because this will often offer economies of scale, and benefits such as longer production runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries such as the US, which is our major bilateral partner and where collaboration allows us access to cutting-edge research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course France with whom we’re now co-operating on a range of defence programmes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together the UK and France account for half of Europe’s defence expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We led last year’s operations in Libya. And we’re now working to develop a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both countries collaboration means our money goes further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means we can maintain a critical mass of demand for skills and industries we might otherwise lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And - very importantly - it ensures we can operate our combined forces effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our open approach can best be summed up by the word ‘pragmatic’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that most certainly does not mean any compromise when it comes to this country’s national security and  capability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology at the heart of the equipment programme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper puts Technology at the heart of our equipment programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of business, technological advantage - quite properly - means making money and increasing your market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For defence it’s now absolutely crucial to our modus operandi, and  making sure we have operational advantage over potential adversaries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to invest in technology to be able to meet an increasingly capable and diverse range of threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why it was so extraordinarily short sighted of the previous Government to more than halve the MOD’s Science and Technology budget between 1997 - 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m determined this process of decline is immediately stopped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it has been. The proportion of spending on Science and Technology is now baselined at its current level of 1.2% of the overall defence budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment that’s around £400 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commitment to technology and open procurement also means opening up defence to providers with agility, innovation and the ability to exploit new and emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that means making defence a lot more accessible to SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key principle of the White Paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="smes"&gt;SMEs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMEs are the lifeblood of any successful industry today. And it’s certainly the case in defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, when its agility and innovation we’re looking for - and that’s certainly been the case in recent years when it comes to getting urgent operational requirements out to our forces in Afghanistan - we have found its these smaller organisations which have proved time and again that they can - and will -  deliver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re determined to open up more of our business to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re already making progress on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, SMEs are currently winning 42% of MOD’s equipment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In financial terms that’s around £1 billion of new business a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many more SMEs are contributing to defence and security programmes as sub contractors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up our business of course also means that we have to be a lot more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means making sure - for example - that there’s an emphasis on open systems factored in to our requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And scope for these smaller companies to offer the kind of modular systems which enhance major weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cde---helping-smes"&gt;CDE - helping SMEs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And making us more accessible of course also means that we need to make sure SMEs know about our requirements - and are able to put forward their ideas and make sure they’re properly assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the Centre for Defence Enterprise - CDE - comes in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based in Harwell it acts as an entry point for new science and technology providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unlocks the potential of SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDE gives practical help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sending out themed calls for proposals on a range of issues, for example,  and organising ‘one to one’ surgeries providing guidance on how best to pitch an idea to the MOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDE cuts through a lot of the red tape which often seems to engulf an organisation as big as ours.  Companies can get advice from the CDE team in Harwell, submit their research proposal online and track its progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that proposal is generally assessed within 25 working days -although it can take as little as 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDE was originally launched as a pilot scheme back in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now time to take it to the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why yesterday I announced an expansion of its role -additional activities which will provide a dedicated focus to SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities such as market place events for SMEs to showcase their projects to defence primes and the venture capital investment community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open engagement events to increase awareness of opportunities within the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a with a small dedicated team from CDE and our Defence, Equipment and Support organisation who will now act as mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be additional annual funding of up to £2 million through the Small Business Research Initiative - or SBRI as it’s more commonly known. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is money which will be directly used to progress successful CDE projects which show the most potential for defence purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s our commitment to sourcing these new providers, and opening up our business, which means that I was particularly intrigued to see that the next session will be debating the role of UK brands in the global market place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, the whole issue of branding can be a bit misleading.  In the old days there was just one label: ‘Made in’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today that same product could probably have a number of different labels to show its provenance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such as ‘designed in’; ‘manufactured in’ or ‘developed in’. The global supply chain is a complex one - and that’s as true for defence as any other industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could of course be argued that the individual UK Armed Forces are in themselves a brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army. The Royal Navy. The Royal Air Force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say these names is to hear their power - as fighting forces and as names that inspire loyalty, affection, respect, trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s probably true that if they are using a particular piece of kit then that’s the kind of endorsement a lot of companies are very keen indeed to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However - the fact is that defence as a customer has no interest whatsoever in brands. We have no ‘brand awareness’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just not a factor when we’re deciding what equipment to buy -and how to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a proposal is innovative, sound and good value it makes no difference to us whether it comes from a household name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or an up and coming SME. A behemoth or a brash upstart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not dazzled by shiny logos. And we’re not interested in flashy marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not equate familiarity with excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brand - for us - is no substitute for a hard earned corporate reputation for project management, for example. That reputation could belong to an SME just as much as a Prime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, when I visit our forces in Afghanistan the last thing they’re worried about is who made the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they want to know is: “Does this work? Will it give me and the people I work with the right support and battle winning capability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us the value of manufacturing is about focusing on the end user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not about ‘who makes the equipment, or piece of kit?’ but rather ‘who will be using it’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Defence that answer will be - our servicemen and women. People whose lives will very often depend on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, indeed, all of you whose liberty could depend on it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/03/27 - CDE Showcase</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that kind introduction Mark. [Mark Fulop, a Director in the DSTL programme office]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I greatly appreciate it and I’m delighted to be here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers and politicians often start speeches saying something like that, but today I really, really mean it. I am genuinely delighted to be here, to celebrate CDE’s success and that of its clients - and to announce some changes that should make the organisation even more effective in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDE is entering a new phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper ‘National Security Through Technology’ has already announced that CDE will have an extended remit to cover the UK’s fast growing UK security sector, which is one of the most diverse and technically advanced in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ll be talking about the organisations which are the real drivers of innovation for defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations which most benefit - indeed really need - the practical support and expertise of the CDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course these organisations are Small and Medium Enterprises, or SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDE will be focusing a lot more on SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical ways. Such as organising SME friendly events and engagement programmes. As well as undertaking a mentoring role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be additional funding available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be going into more detail on this later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And talking about the additional resources, and funding, CDE will get to deliver more support to SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking around this morning’s exhibition I’ve again been struck by the range and inventiveness of the ideas on show, and I sometimes feel I’m in a parallel universe where the MoD can do no wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the modular robotic systems by Robosynthesis, to the extraordinary e-textile developed by Intelligent Textiles which distributes electrical power and data without the need for cables -I’m pleased to see they’ve solved their connector problem from last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m told, by the way, it currently holds the Guinness World Record for being the world’s most advanced soldier system uniform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting our people is about making sure they are well equipped with these future battle winning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s also about making sure we provide them with the very best medical care and rehabilitation support if they are injured in the line of duty. These will be of particular interest to my ministerial colleague Nick Harvey who is here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another important strand of CDE’s work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Frazer-Nash adaptive bike on display here today is the prototype of a design, with the final version now in use and proving a huge success at Headley Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to be able to see all this kit first hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on a personal level it’s also been a very welcome opportunity to meet the men and women who are the brains behind these innovative solutions to challenging questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are individuals who come from a range of backgrounds and disciplines, a number of whom had never had any contact with Defence until they started working with CDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s really important. I want CDE to reach out beyond the “usual suspects” to bring fresh thinking to Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they will all share, however, is a passion for innovation. And a determination to see their ideas developed and out there helping our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all our exhibitors here today I’d just like to say ‘Thank you’ for bringing your ideas to Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your solutions are already making a vital contribution to our defence effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am determined we should not rest on our laurels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="role-and-value-of-cde"&gt;Role and value of CDE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk about why the work of the CDE is so important. And about our plans to take it forward on to the next phase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen today, Defence is a sector with a lot of potential for people and companies with a talent for invention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDE unlocks that potential. It acts as the entry point for new science and technology providers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a hub and first point of contact for SMEs, academics and others who want to know how to pitch an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how does the CDE add value for MOD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer’s simple - it gives us reach into areas of fast moving technical innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an area such as maritime innovation, for example, which CDE launched as an open call at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDE held a briefing on a range of technical challenges - from improving navigation capability of unmanned underwater vehicles to next generation submarine sensors and improving the security of data on submarines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or how best to take forward new ISTAR solutions. Recent conflicts have shown us just how important this issue is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safeguarding our nation and our nation’s interest covers a huge spectrum of activity and effort. The work of CDE reflects that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly four years ago - May 2008 to be exact - since the CDE was launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was originally the brainchild of Paul Drayson - a former Minister for Defence Equipment under the previous Government.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Paul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an engineer and entrepreneur he had a deep rooted understanding of just how vital innovation was when it came to delivering cutting edge solutions for defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He played a major role in raising the profile of science and technology across the MOD. Although he must have been disappointed to see S&amp;amp;T fall as a share of MoD’s spending -  something I hope we’ve now put right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul was instrumental in the setting up of CDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knew that if Defence was to be able to exploit new and emerging technologies - which it had to, to meet the challenges it faced - the department would need to be proactively reaching out to people with the ideas.  The sort of people who very often weren’t aware that their ideas could help Defence..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so it would need to be more accessible - and to be seen to be more accessible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Drayson was absolutely right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why the CDE was set up with three main aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To provide visibility of the MOD’s requirements &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To inform and support new supply networks &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And above all to widen the MOD’s supplier base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we would all agree that this is an organisation which has more than lived up to these founding principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its launch the CDE has established a reputation for reaching out across a very wide spectrum of the engineering and scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a dynamic hub, running open and themed calls on key sectors, as well as seminars and workshops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it holds regular surgeries - ‘one to ones’ - where individuals and companies can get personalised guidance on what the MoD is looking for, and practical help on how to pitch an idea to us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results show that this approach has worked - to date over 3,000 proposals have been received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research contracts awarded to date are worth a total of over £23.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today marks the award of the 500th contract - to ITSUS,  an SME based in Wales who I was talking to just before I came in here, which is working to improve network capacity for military operations where bandwidth is a scarce and valuable commodity. This is one of the Holy Grails of Defence - a really central challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract, worth £104,000, is on top of a previous £50,000 CDE contract. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITSUS will be using the funds to look at how existing systems can be used more efficiently, and give our forces an enhanced tactical advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be hearing shortly from Jonathan Byrne. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan, as Head of CDE  I understand that you often advise companies when they’re pitching to MOD that they need to make sure their solutions focus on  ‘explicit deliverables’ and ‘compelling outputs’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend this practical and no-nonsense approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned that pretty well encapsulates the urgency and relevance of what we’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDE successfully cuts through a lot of the red tape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in very practical ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies can get advice from the CDE team in Harwell, submit their research proposal online and track its progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also - and this is particularly important for SMEs - a proposal can be assessed in around 25 days, though on occasion it will take as little as 15 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDE demonstrates that Defence is open for business - and hungry for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="white-paper---smes-and-boosting-the-role-of-cde"&gt;White Paper - SMEs and boosting the role of CDE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to build on the significant achievements of the CDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And see even more of these ideas and concepts becoming mature products which contribute to battle winning capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why boosting the role of CDE is one of the deliverables of our recent White Paper ‘National Security Through Technology.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper places technology at the heart of our Defence Equipment and Support effort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to. Exploiting new and emerging technologies is central to making sure our Armed Forces have the battle-winning capabilities they need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe the SMEs have the agility and innovation required to deliver these solutions. And at the best possible price for the taxpayer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With rapidly changing technologies, we will often find solutions to our challenges not among the big beasts of the defence jungle, but among the smaller, more agile businesses that think quicker and react more immediately to change, challenge and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why opening up more of our business to SMEs is another commitment from the White Paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just because we agree with the wider governmental growth agenda. It’s because we in defence absolutely need SMEs to deliver our outputs. To solve our problems. To keep our people safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are making progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, SMEs are currently winning around 42% of MOD’s equipment contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In financial terms that’s around £1 billion of new business a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many more SMEs are contributing to Defence and Security programmes as sub-contractors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is more we can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, that is why we’ll be taking what we call an Open Procurement approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach will focus on ensuring there’s an emphasis on ‘open systems’ factored in to our requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will mean there’s scope for SMEs to offer the kind of modular systems which enhance major weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also maximise the opportunities for SMEs at Prime and Sub-contract level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a focus on exportability across our equipment programme will open up new markets for your products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s essential that SMEs - whose issues are often very different from those of Primes - have their own platform within the defence industry to engage with the Department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I have established a dedicated SME Forum which addresses the concerns of smaller companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chair these meetings personally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are a really useful way of getting together with industry to address the kind of challenges some of you here may be facing - on issues such as IPR for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify issues that MoD needs to address and which the SMEs themselves need to think about too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADS are members of the Forum and I know we’ll be hearing from you later on; Rees I look forward to that speech very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="taking-cde-to-the-next-level---smes-and-active-engagement"&gt;Taking CDE to the next level - SMES and active engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Championing SMEs requires us to go out of our way to encourage and champion greater pull through of innovative ideas into applications and contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why the White Paper highlights the need to - and I quote: ‘enhance the role of the CDE, such that it works more closely with the SMEs that it funds, including the facilitation of opportunities to engage with prime contractors to increase the likelihood of exploitation of the most innovative outputs.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means as I’ve already said, taking CDE to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In broadening the reach of CDE to address both defence and security markets, as well as deepening its support to new entrants into the defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, in the words of the White Paper again, ‘enhancing exploitation mechanisms between CDE and our suppliers.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do this with an active focus on SMEs, and on implementing an active “SME friendly” engagement programme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three parts to this initiative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what they all boil down to is this - CDE will be focussing much more clearly on SMEs in its future work through a series of SME initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part one. I talked about CDE’s role as an entry point to Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it also has another function - as a bridge linking the SMEs and the main defence suppliers, as well as investors and wider Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The added value CDE brings here is in facilitating networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this year CDE will be launching a series of market place events. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will be designed for SMEs to showcase their project outputs to Defence Primes; the venture capital investment community and innovation initiatives across government within other government departments such as the Technology Strategy Board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of this SME initiative will be the introduction of nine new ‘Open Engagement’ events to increase awareness of opportunities within the Defence research and development market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these will be working jointly with industry bodies and knowledge transfer networks, as well as specific industry sectors - such as Transport and Healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, we’ve used Formula 1 technology, as you’ll probably know, in the latest of our armoured vehicles - the Foxhound -which we’ll soon be deploying in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And part three of the SME initiative will involve CDE mentoring SMEs - in order to guide and help their approach to maximise opportunities for exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDE will be a promoter - giving SMEs the opportunity to present their innovations to leading defence and other suppliers and users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the MOD - in common with the rest of the public sector - is heavily constrained when it comes to resources, I have arranged that CDE and DE&amp;amp;S will each be bringing extra focus on supporting SME engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of CDE’s strengths is its fleetness of foot, born of a small, unbureaucratic structure. I don’t want this to change. But I do want to see CDE’s clients access the acquisition programmes of MoD much more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So both organisations, CDE and DE&amp;amp;S, will be devoting a handful of staff - probably four each - to this effort. They will be the Sherpas who help make good ideas real. Who ensure CDE’s clients can reach the summit of their ambition. And so help solve more of MoD’s equipment challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise roles and locations of the staff are yet to be decided, but my key message is that we are committed to SME engagement, we are already delivering against it and we’re going to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be hearing about all of this in more detail from Jonathan Byrne. Jonathan heads up CDE and he and his team will be taking this work forward in the months ahead. And I’ll be keeping a very close eye on it, so make it work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="funding"&gt;Funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also announce that there will be additional funding for the CDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under present arrangements, the CDE, which is part of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, or DSTL as it’s more commonly known, is funded by the defence research programme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sum has also been boosted by another funding route - through the Technology Strategy Board’s support for the Small Business Research Initiative - or SBRI as it’s more commonly known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SBRI already provides funding of up to £1.5 million a year on Phase 1 - the innovation, or new ideas stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m pleased to be able to confirm that the SBRI will also now be providing additional funding to the CDE at the Phase 2 level. This funding will be up to a maximum of £2 million a year, to be used to  progress successful projects which show the most potential for Defence purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sum will complement MOD funding, and expands the work Defence can gain from our Science and Technology Programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also enables the Technology Strategy Board to support more technology SMEs at vital times in their development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great example of Government departments working together for the good of UK business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And delivering innovation for our Armed Forces. And I’m very grateful to the TSB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be exploring with my BIS colleagues how the good ideas brought to CDE that don’t neatly suit defence and security demands but have clear potential elsewhere in government or industry can be encouraged into reality too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cde-providing-greater-visibility-of-activity---and-contracts"&gt;CDE providing greater visibility of activity - and contracts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke earlier about visibility as a founding principle of the CDE when it came to the MOD providing clarity of our requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry across the board - Primes and SMEs - have now told us that they would welcome much more visibility as to who has been awarded which contract by CDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have also requested more advance notice of CDE plans to issue themed calls so that they are able to plan ahead and be prepared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies and organisations have told us this is important because it will allow all sectors to start scoping opportunities at an early stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what we’re going to do. CDE tell me that from today they will publish and maintain on their website their programme of events with a minimum 6 month horizon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from the autumn details of contract awards will also be accessible from the CDE website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this addresses the entirely reasonable concerns of industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDE started off as pilot scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years on it’s a going concern - and about to enter an exciting new phase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is a direct reflection of Defence as a vibrant sector here in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a nation with the fourth largest defence budget in the world. And we’re the second largest Defence exporter in the world, with £6 billion of sales and 22% of the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facts, as they say, speak for themselves. Defence is most definitely a sector of opportunity. And especially innovative smaller businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/03/21 - Franco-British Council 2012 Defence Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je vous remercie pour l’opportunite d’assister a cette reunion du Conseil et d’avoir l’occasion de vous presenter une ou deux de mes pensees a propos de la cooperation franco-britannique dans le domaine de la defense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je suis toujours enchantes de visiter Paris et je suis particulierement content d’etre ici dans un contexte pareil; le succes de notre cooperation en Libye, le succes du Sommet le mois dernier, l’arrive d’un nouveau Ambassadeur et surtout l’approfondissement rapide de la cooperation entre nos armees et dans le domaine des equipements depuis la signature du Traite en 2010 [deux mille dix].  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m delighted to be here in the year that the Franco-British Council celebrates its 40th Anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an organisation which has grown in influence and stature over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a well established reputation for exploring the issues of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to see that Defence is recognised as an integral part of this ongoing dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I see you also have your own web page on the Franco-British Council site - [www.francobritishdefence.org] which acts as a really useful information hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the President D’Honneur, Madame Chairman and Council Members for their work in supporting - and promoting - this defence relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must also thank our Ambassador, (H.M. Ambassador Peter Ricketts) for so kindly hosting our conference. Given his previous role as our National Security Advisor, I am confident that deepening of our Franco-British Defence relationship will be a priority for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uk-france---the-importance-of-our-defence-relationship"&gt;UK-France - the importance of our Defence relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence is central to the values the UK and France share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to talk about our Defence relationship, and why it is important to seize this historic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About why it is important to drive forward this process of collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how we are doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me start with looking at why co-operation makes sense for lots of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His Excellency Bernard Emie, in a recent speech to the British defence community cited Professor Robert Tombs - the noted Cambridge academic - who I think summed it up pretty well. He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Franco British relations over the two centuries since Waterloo could be seen as a transformation from enmity to alliance and finally partnership…Today they are the only European states that maintain ambitions for a world role. Conceivably, both might prefer other partners, but in the world of the 2010s the reality is that we have only each other’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This eloquently defines the strategic necessity for our  bilateral relationship.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A partnership which makes sense because: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are both outward-looking nations, with experience and knowledge of almost every-part of the globe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We recognise we live a dangerous and uncertain world in which taking shelter behind some mythical Fortress Europe just isn’t an option&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We both understand the importance of a strong defence - not only to ensure that our territory is secure - but to contribute to international security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We invest in Defence and meet our NATO responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have battle winning capabilities and highly trained and effective Armed Forces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And crucially - we share the political will to act - and have the deployable defence capabilities to do so&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyone who doubted that by the way only has to look at Libya. President Sarkozy was absolutely right when he described the UK and France as the ‘heavy lifters’ of European defence  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We share the same responsibilities on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As permanent members of the UN Security Council - as nuclear powers -as leading members of the G8, the EU and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We share a similar world view, we share the same geographic space, we are of similar size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With us there is no grand frere et petit frere - although the way our respective media portray our relationship you would think we are more like quarrelling siblings..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is a collaboration of logic and sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forces that pull us together are far more powerful than the forces that seek to drive us apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="libya-and-nato"&gt;Libya and NATO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya was a real turning point and an affirmation that forging a new and stronger partnership was the right thing to do.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libya campaign was assisted by operating in a NATO framework.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO provided legitimacy, a Headquarters; as well as a common language and set of procedures.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is established, proven and based on shared values. It is a uniquely capable organisation as Libya - and indeed Afghanistan - have demonstrated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we need NATO to become stronger.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Libya showed us, there were a number of capability gaps which were highlighted by the Libya campaign.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We - the UK and France are now prioritising our joint work in light of lessons identified in areas such as Command and Control; Information Systems and targeting and reconnaissance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course across the Alliance it is ever more essential to ensure nations give priority those capabilities NATO needs. I commend the NATO Smart Defence Initiative. The UK is a keen supporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="co-operation-in-austerity"&gt;Co-operation in Austerity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our economies and defence budgets are under pressure, the rationale for co-operation in these times of Defence austerity becomes ever stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, for example, to develop our Combined Joint Expeditionary Force. We hope the CJEF will be up and running by 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French and British units and ships have been undertaking reciprocal training exercises as we continue to develop the new force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m told our forces - like the true professionals they are - operate very well together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there does appear to be some friendly rivalry over who has the best ration packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, collaboration is an important principle of our approach to Defence equipment and support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an efficient way of delivering a balanced and affordable equipment programme. It means we can look to exploit economies of scale when it  comes to harmonising British and French requirements and sharing overhead costs.. It also helps to boost export opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows us to maximise our capabilities - particularly when it comes to sharing technologies, and it allows us to spread the cost - and the risk - of research and acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course in the case of the UK-France partnership all of these factors also support interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with France is not detrimental to our national sovereignty, provided that we retain operational advantage and freedom of action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our view is that it can help to consolidate our equipment programme and sustain aspects of our operational advantage and freedom of action.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK we spend around 40% of the nation’s defence budget every year - a figure of around £13 billion - on equipment acquisition, support and technology.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By getting together we can make this money - and indeed both our budgets - go further.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do have the spending power - together the UK and France account for around 50% of European spending on defence.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense for us to collaborate. Work together and plan together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we have to look ahead, horizon scan and develop capabilities to meet future challenges… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why Research and Technology is an area where investment is absolutely key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commitment to an annual target of 50 million Euros each from the UK and France on joint research shows we’re serious about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in particular when it comes to critical technologies where the market, civil or defence, may not be sufficiently strong to meet UK and France defence needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be looking to industry to work with us on this - we need their expertise when it comes to identifying vulnerabilities. As well as spotting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya and Afghanistan demonstrated the usefulness of Unmanned Air Systems, more commonly known as drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month’s UK-France summit committed us to taking forward our planned cooperation on UAS.  In the longer term these will develop into unmanned combat air systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint funding and interdependence should help sustain industrial capability and deliver cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another programme is A400M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is taking delivery of this transport aircraft in 2013 and we in the UK get ours in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re developing a common support plan - including spare parts for our future fleets of these aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="challenges"&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK-France project is a mature cooperation between democratic nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore we can be open about areas of disagreement and where we have different agendas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the UK has preferred to look to NATO first and then the EU, whereas France has leaned towards the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted when France rejoined the NATO military structures in 2009 and became a full player in that vital organisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been significant convergence between our national positions over the years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the French preparatory work for their next Livre Blanc shows a balance between multi-lateral engagement with the EU and NATO, and bilateral engagement with key partners such as the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the publication of that document in the month after the elections will set the strategic direction for France on a whole range of issues.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bigger challenge for European nations is not should our forces work under NATO or the EU but how do we maintain capable forces? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will no doubt be the subject of some lively debate for those taking part in this morning’s workshop .    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="making-it-work"&gt;Making it Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK we have changed our institutional architecture to support the deepening of our bilateral relationship with France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our International Policy France team in the Ministry of Defence provides us with a central hub covering a range of activity - from equipment and procurement to political and military cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yesterday evening it was my pleasure to announce that the defence staff in our embassy here in Paris now have a new name: British Defence Staff-France.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a move which acknowledges the  increase in the Exchange and Liaison Footprint in France, as well as the Defence Section here in Paris. &lt;br&gt;
This is a highly symbolic move.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one other British Embassy across the world which has been accorded similar status, and that is our Defence presence in Washington - known as British Defence Staff - US.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new organisation recognises this change in dynamic and will be a ‘one shop’ stop, co-ordinating the expanding areas of activity and development across our partnership.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will include taking forward our portfolio of co-operative equipment programmes.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a significant move, and reflects the UK’s commitment to a partnership which is dynamic, and rapidly gathering pace.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winston Churchill said that ‘difficulties mastered are opportunities won’.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that ethos is - I believe - what our defence relationship - is all about.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about working together on the challenges we face.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding and exploiting opportunities in more areas where we can work together in a smarter, more cost effective way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may always be differences in our styles or our methods.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is invariably true of any successful partnership.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These differences will often play to the particular strengths of each country. To the way we complement; balance and develop our defence capabilities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is going to be very important - and what I know we can achieve - is harmonisation of approach. Three areas in particular are vital to ensuring that we work successfully together over the longer term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political commitment: we will continue to signal the importance that both Governments attach to the defence relationship;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-operation between our Armed Forces; a combined Joint Expeditionary Force is a sign of progress but co-operation needs to be embedded throughout the two organisations and in military doctrine;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint investment in research and technology; this is essential in creating the future capabilities for fighting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference is a really useful chance to stocktake, challenge some of our assumptions and assess progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for one am looking forward to ‘having my feet held to the fire’ this morning when I chair the  workshop which I see has the  slightly ominous title of ‘Franco-British Defence Co-operation: the balance sheet’.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you. And now, the floor is yours - any questions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;And I’m delighted to be here in the year that the Franco-British Council celebrates its 40th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an organisation which has grown in influence and stature over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a well established reputation for exploring the issues of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to see that defence is recognised as an integral part of this ongoing dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I see you also have your own web page on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.francobritishcouncil.org.uk/" title="Franco-British Council"&gt;Franco-British Council&lt;/a&gt; site which acts as a really useful information hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We share the same responsibilities on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As permanent members of the UN Security Council, as nuclear powers, as leading members of the G8, the EU and Nato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We share a similar world view, we share the same geographic space, we are of similar size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With us there is no grand frère et petit frère - although the way our respective media portray our relationship you would think we are more like quarrelling siblings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is a collaboration of logic and sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forces that pull us together are far more powerful than the forces that seek to drive us apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="libya-and-nato"&gt;Libya and Nato&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya was a real turning point and an affirmation that forging a new and stronger partnership was the right thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libya campaign was assisted by operating in a Nato framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m told our forces, like the true professionals they are, operate very well together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, collaboration is an important principle of our approach to defence equipment and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an efficient way of delivering a balanced and affordable equipment programme. It means we can look to exploit economies of scale when it comes to harmonising British and French requirements and sharing overhead costs. It also helps to boost export opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows us to maximise our capabilities, particularly when it comes to sharing technologies, and it allows us to spread the cost, and the risk, of research and acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course in the case of the UK-France partnership all of these factors also support interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in particular when it comes to critical technologies where the market, civil or defence, may not be sufficiently strong to meet UK and France defence needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be looking to industry to work with us on this; we need their expertise when it comes to identifying vulnerabilities. As well as spotting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="challenges"&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK-France project is a mature cooperation between democratic nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore we can be open about areas of disagreement and where we have different agendas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the UK has preferred to look to Nato first and then the EU, whereas France has leaned towards the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted when France rejoined the Nato military structures in 2009 and became a full player in that vital organisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been significant convergence between our national positions over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the French preparatory work for their next Livre Blanc shows a balance between multi-lateral engagement with the EU and Nato, and bilateral engagement with key partners such as the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our International Policy France team in the Ministry of Defence provides us with a central hub covering a range of activity, from equipment and procurement to political and military cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yesterday evening it was my pleasure to announce that the defence staff in our embassy here in Paris now have a new name: British Defence Staff - France. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a move which acknowledges the increase in the Exchange and Liaison Footprint in France, as well as the Defence Section here in Paris.
This is a highly symbolic move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one other British Embassy across the world which has been accorded similar status, and that is our defence presence in Washington, known as British Defence Staff - US.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new organisation recognises this change in dynamic and will be a ‘one stop’ shop, co-ordinating the expanding areas of activity and development across our partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will include taking forward our portfolio of co-operative equipment programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a significant move, and reflects the UK’s commitment to a partnership which is dynamic, and rapidly gathering pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winston Churchill said that ‘difficulties mastered are opportunities won’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that ethos is, I believe, what our defence relationship is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about working together on the challenges we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding and exploiting opportunities in more areas where we can work together in a smarter, more cost effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may always be differences in our styles or our methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is invariably true of any successful partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These differences will often play to the particular strengths of each country. To the way we complement; balance and develop our defence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is going to be very important, and what I know we can achieve, is harmonisation of approach. Three areas in particular are vital to ensuring that we work successfully together over the longer term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;political commitment: we will continue to signal the importance that both governments attach to the defence relationship&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;co-operation between our armed forces; a combined Joint Expeditionary Force is a sign of progress but co-operation needs to be embedded throughout the two organisations and in military doctrine&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;joint investment in research and technology; this is essential in creating the future capabilities for fighting together&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conference is a really useful chance to stocktake, challenge some of our assumptions and assess progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for one am looking forward to ‘having my feet held to the fire’ this morning when I chair the workshop which I see has the slightly ominous title of ‘Franco-British defence co-operation: the balance sheet’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you. And now, the floor is yours; any questions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
