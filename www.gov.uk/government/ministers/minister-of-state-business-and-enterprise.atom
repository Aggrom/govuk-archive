    <title>Business minister unlocks new business potential</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 Sep 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenger businesses to be freed from red tape &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Sep/minister-unlocks-business-potential#mentors"&gt;22,000 business mentors now accessible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Sep/minister-unlocks-business-potential#support"&gt;Extra money to help entrepreneurs, including women in business, find the right mentor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the MADE entrepreneur festival in Sheffield, Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon announced that there will be new independent scrutiny of the rules and regulations that are barriers to growth for challenger businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are innovative enterprises that do not follow established ways of business working, and which might be held back by burdensome bureaucracy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Fallon said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Challenger businesses create wealth and jobs - we should champion them at every opportunity. They put new products on our shelves, innovate our service industry and create new markets using the latest technology. I don’t want these pioneers falling foul of outdated regulations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am now looking in more depth at the rules and regulations that are holding back our most forward-thinking entrepreneurs. That’s why in addition to the package of proposals I’m publishing today, I am also strengthening the role of the independent Regulatory Policy Committee to make sure that regulation barriers to challenger businesses growth are removed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experimental &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge work&lt;/a&gt; uncovered a wide range of issues - not all purely regulatory, but relevant to this theme. Key proposals are to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new independent role to champion deregulation for innovative businesses &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage a self regulating approach in the peer-to-peer finance industry by increasing membership of their finance associations and building on their consumer code of practice &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help knowledge-based businesses to secure finance by working with banking and accountancy experts to improve existing guidance and raise awareness of the Government schemes which can help &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify ways to drive down costs in applying for and defending patents, including examining the operation of the US ‘small entity’ regime &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it cheaper and simpler for SMEs to challenge potential infringements of their trade marks &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a better balance to the rights of consumers and online traders by implementing a new Consumer Rights Directive to replace the existing distance selling regulations &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amend the Estate Agents Act (1979) to take out of its scope intermediaries such as private sale portals, which only advertise properties and provide a means for sellers and buyers to communicate with each other.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the report: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/enterprise/docs/r/12-984-removing-red-tape-for-challenger-businesses.pdf"&gt;Removing red tape for challenger businesses (PDF, 284 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister also announced Northamptonshire as the “most enterprising place in Britain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="business-mentors-now-accessible"&gt;22,000 business mentors now accessible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Fallon also gave an added boost to entrepreneurs by announcing that a network of 22,000 mentors is now accessible on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mentorsme.co.uk/"&gt;Mentorsme website&lt;/a&gt;. He added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Business mentors play a vital role in helping SMEs to build their knowledge base as the support comes from someone who has been there and done it before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is great that we now have a vast network of accessible business mentors but we want to grow that number even further and give greater choice to our entrepreneurs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="extra-money-to-help-entrepreneurs-including-women-in-business-access-more-support"&gt;Extra money to help entrepreneurs, including women in business, access more support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that entrepreneurs, particularly women in business, are aware that this support is available, Culture Secretary Maria Miller has today announced that £100,000 will be invested to help them find the right mentor to help their business prosper. This will bring the total government investment in the mentoring programme to £1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Fallon will be making the announcements at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.madefestival.com/"&gt;MADE entrepreneur festival&lt;/a&gt; in Sheffield. There he will meet young entrepreneurs and take part in the Intuit 100-up session, where young business people will be matched up with volunteer business mentors, trained through the Get Mentoring initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Importance of aerospace</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Government, we value the aerospace sector. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, when opening the show, this is a Â£24bn industry with 100,000 direct jobs and many more besides.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the prospects for the sector are remarkable. 27,000 fixed wing aircraft alone will be needed between now and 2030. That’s a $3.2trillion market. These are just some of the reasons why we formed the Aerospace Growth Partnership.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by partnership, we mean not just Government and industry working together, but also industry with industry (greater collaboration/innovation).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the Secretary of State has launched our Strategic Vision for Aerospace. It is a statement of intent from both Government and industry, that far from giving up our position in global market; we are going to build on our strengths and broaden our customer base.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It underlines this Government’s commitment to a clear industrial strategy - working with industry to recognise where the UK has strong capability and then backing it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means in the short term the Aerospace Growth Partnership looking at what capability currently exists in UK, and what needs to be done to improve it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means in the medium term looking at opportunities for UK business on upgrade programmes and to introduce new technology.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it means in the long term that we want to be more competitive and win the maximum work on next generation of aircraft, which is why work is already underway to identify the key technologies to achieve that.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On technology, we know that business is looking for greater certainty about the quantum and flow of funding available. We realise that an industry like aerospace needs longer term predictability from Government if you’re to have the confidence to invest. So we are committed to work with you on this through the Aerospace Growth Partnership.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger of any Government/industry forum is that it could simply be about words. The Aerospace Growth Partnership is not about words. Indeed it has already acted.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus in the Budget, we’ve agreed to Â£60m to create UK Centre for Aerodynamics.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And over past two days we have now announced nearly Â£200m of jointly funded programmes with business. These include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first Â£47m research and technology projects on aerodynamics as priorities for the Aerodynamics Centre; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A series of manufacturing process research projects totalling Â£80m to be delivered through the TSB and led by Rolls-Royce &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creation of 500 Masters level places for aerospace engineers, (in which business will invest alongside Government) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And in addition, there is a Â£15m joint Government and industry investment announced today, through the Technology Strategy Board, for 11 major business-led R&amp;amp;D projects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Aerospace Growth Partnership is not just about money. Much of our work is about how business engages with government; and how business engages with itself especially across supply chains. Our work will continue until December when Aerospace Growth Partnership produces a final report, but we’re already seeing positive progress.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, as the Strategic Vision is developed into a long-term strategy, the Government will play its part by: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximising the impact it can have on growth, by aligning all our policy levers to encourage investment and exports; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And creating a more educated workforce, that is the most flexible in Europe. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the Aerospace Growth Partnership process has involved some 80 business people directly involved in our working groups - for example on Technology, Supply Chain Competitiveness, Manufacturing Capability, and External Engagement. They have been supported by eight full-time secondees from business - some really bright young talent.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the experience with the secondees has been so beneficial, that we are now considering how we can make secondees a permanent feature of the dialogue between government and business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-listening-and-acting"&gt;Government listening and acting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke earlier about partnership. Partners listen to each other, so in that spirit I have some good news.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Boeing and others have come to us and requested that the UK Government ratifies the Cape Town Convention and Aircraft Protocol. The aims of this are to bring speed, certainty and cost savings to the process of repossessing aircraft and engines, in cases of insolvency or default, where these assets are in a country whose legal system may not make that an easy process. The hope is that the benefits to financiers then result in reduced finance costs for airlines.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to confirm to you today that we are committed to ratifying the Convention. We first have some more work to do with business, following our Call for Evidence, to clarify the costs and benefits involved. And as part of our policy process we plan to consult on changes to the law needed for UK ratification. So we will be working closely with business to complete the process, as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defence"&gt;Defence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of us listening is on defence - a major part of our advanced manufacturing base. The Government has twin responsibilities in relation to defence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, to ensure that our armed forces, national security, and law enforcement agencies have the best capabilities we can afford, at the best value for money for the taxpayer. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secondly, to recognise that a healthy and competitive defence and security industry, contributes to growth and a re-balanced economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I have made clear this morning, our experience on the civil side with the Aerospace Growth Partnership has been a positive one.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we now intend to start a similar dialogue with the defence and security industry. That will help maximise the value to our economy of this industry without undermining our efforts to get best value for the MOD as customer.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are doing much already to promote defence exports and encourage defence SMEs. There are other areas where we can do more to encourage investment into the UK. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to exploit synergies between civil and military technologies; and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We also need to promote reforms that encourage the movement of people between defence and other parts of our advanced manufacturing base to help develop and sustain vital engineering skills. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Prime Minister has asked my Secretary of State to lead on work in this area and you will be hearing more from us about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="skills"&gt;Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to say something briefly about skills in aerospace.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sector is not only growing at an incredible rate (effectively doubling in size every 15 years), but we also know technologies in next generation aircraft are likely to be radically different. So it is essential that we continue to attract young talent with the right skills.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are expanding substantially expanding the number of apprenticeships right across industry.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also creating 24 University Technical College, so from 2014 onwards, thousand more young people can gain good engineering skills.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also pleased to see that up to 10,000 young people are expected to participate here in Futures Day on Friday in a wide range of events, and so get a taster of the exciting career opportunities in aerospace. BIS is proud to be a Gold Sponsor and I would like to congratulate ADS in putting together such a fantastic programme.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like also to thank you for your involvement in 2 other joint projects with Government: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Inside Manufacturing - the aerospace industry hosted over 60 events in June alone aimed at young people, undergraduates and teachers. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it in Great Britain - aerospace is a major participant of exhibition later this month at Science Museum, which showcase the best of our design, engineering and manufacturing. I hope to see you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that these events will inspire the next generation of engineers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ladies and gentlemen, this is a sector with a big future. One that will create growth and prosperity for the UK for many years to come. It won’t be easy, but together we can win out. I look forward to working with you all, to turn that ambition into reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Top Inventors Make it in Great Britain</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Jul 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful entries of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://makeitingreatbritain.bis.gov.uk/NEWS-04072012091538"&gt;Make it in Great Britain Challenge&lt;/a&gt; include new technology which could offer relief to tinnitus sufferers and a pram that folds into a rucksack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are two of the 17 finalists announced today in the challenge, backed by Dragon’s Den tycoon Deborah Meaden and Business Minister Mark Prisk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other top brainwaves include an eco-friendly alternative to concrete and an engine that cuts fuel consumption by two thirds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inventions are all still in development and winning could get them into production. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK is full of creative manufacturing expertise, and I’m delighted that we are able to celebrate some of the best pre-market ideas through the Challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had a great response, and I’m particularly excited by some of the entries received in the Breakthrough category. I’d urge the public to get voting and tell us who they would like to receive the honour of being named the People’s Choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of six expert judges came up with the 17 shortlisted entries, which will all go on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/galleries/make_great_britain.aspx"&gt;display at London’s Science Museum&lt;/a&gt; this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will benefit from the exposure of their idea to multi-national companies and the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winning entries will showcase alongside names such as Mars and McLaren, and leading small and medium businesses like Ultra Global in celebration of manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the six-week exhibition will be invited to vote on their favourite entry. The winners from each weekly vote will feature together in the final week of the exhibit.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Manufacturers open doors to careers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Inside Manufacturing involves businesses from across the food &amp;amp; drink, aerospace &amp;amp; defence and automotive sectors. They will open their doors for over 100 events throughout June to show young people, teachers and careers advisers what exciting opportunities exist in 21st century manufacturing.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people are expected to visit iconic names such as Coca Cola, Mars, Warburtons, Aston Martin, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus and GKN Aerospace over the coming weeks and get hands on with the latest designs and technologies that make Britain one of the world’s leading manufacturing nations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Minister visited Coca Cola Enterprises in Edmonton, London where he joined pupils from Uxbridge College to see for himself how the famous drink is made.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This year See Inside Manufacturing is bigger and better following the success of its pilot last year in the automotive sector - when over 1000 people visited 100 events across the country to learn more about the exciting opportunities available in manufacturing.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Enterprise showcase gets royal seal of approval</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk called for firms of all sizes to enter the Queen’s Awards for Enterprise as he met with some of its winners at a showcase held in their honour at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started in 1966, the Queen’s Awards for Enterprise are the UK’s highest accolade for business success. The award is given to outstanding UK companies leading the way in international trade, innovation and sustainable development. The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise Promotion also celebrate individuals who make outstanding contributions to enterprise culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the displays at the showcase include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A three-wheeler all-terrain electric mobility vehicle by Beamer Ltd which featured on BBC’s Top Gear &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A selection of unique detangling hairbrushes by Tangle Teezer &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A special Jubilee-themed folding bicycle designed by Brompton Bicycles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been very impressed by the entries to this year’s awards. Of the 209 winners, 180 are small and medium sized businesses and almost half are from manufacturing. This demonstrates how smaller businesses and the manufacturing industry can drive growth for UK PLC. I encourage firms to get involved and submit their entries for next year’s awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This showcase forms part of a package of initiatives and programmes Government is leading to show how innovative and world-leading our manufacturing base is here in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For example, businesses up and down the country are opening their factories to visitors this month as part of our See Inside Manufacturing campaign. Also, the Make it in Great Britain campaign, which is dispelling the myth that we don’t make anything in the UK anymore, will culminate during the Olympic and Paralympic Games at an exhibit at the Science Museum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rightfully so, image is important, but we also need to ensure that businesses get the support they need to grow. This is why we have rolled out initiatives such as the £125 million Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative and recently re-launched the Manufacturing Advisory Service.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise showcase will be on display at the Department for Business until Friday 15 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entry is now open for the 2013 Queen’s Awards for Enterprise and will close on 28 September 2012.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volunteer to make a difference to the way regulations are enforced</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement"&gt;Focus on Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; campaign, government is encouraging anyone involved in volunteering to arrange events - from arranging a jumble sale, to organising a Jubilee party - to share their experiences of dealing with local authorities and other regulators. For the next six weeks, we want to hear how the way regulations are enforced can be improved, reduced or done differently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiences with regulators might include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with paperwork &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;advice from regulators you come into contact with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign allows comments to be posted anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Volunteers are the unsung heroes of communities in this country. But dealing with the way rules are enforced enforcement of rules can sometimes be more of a problem than the red tape itself - no one volunteers to be a bureaucrat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, whether it’s an inspection by someone who won’t listen or having to fill in the same form twice - we want to hear about it. I urge you to go to the Focus on Enforcement website and let us know your views so that we can take action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know there are good regulators out there, so we also want you to tell us on the website about the heroes - people who give really good guidance and help your event to happen well and safely” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the third in a series of regulatory reviews. Businesses in food and chemicals manufacturing can still comment on regulatory experiences within their sectors, while we are also looking for suggestions for future reviews. The best suggestions will guide Ministers in prioritising future reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Construction industry showcase digs in at BIS</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;16 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the Construction Equipment Association, ‘Constructing the Future’ celebrates UK construction equipment manufacturing and its excellence across engineering, innovation and low carbon solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Mark Prisk said, “The construction equipment industry is one of the UK’s most dynamic sectors, and contributes £8.5 billion to our economy each year. Most people don’t realise that the UK is the second largest net exporter of construction equipment in the world. Over 75 per cent of products manufactured in the UK are exported to 150 countries world-wide. That is an impressive figure.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This showcase is just one of the steps this Government is taking to demonstrate just how innovative and world-leading our manufacturing base is here in the UK, and change perceptions that as a country we don’t make anything anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve launched the Make it in Great Britain campaign which is hunting for fresh pre-market ideas and concepts, culminating in an exhibition during the Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer. So too, businesses up and down the country will be opening their factories to visitors next month as part of our See Inside Manufacturing campaign.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Image is important, but we also need to ensure that businesses get the support they need to grow. This is why we have rolled out initiatives such as the £125 million &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-sectors/manufacturing-materials-and-engineering/manufacturing/growth-review-framework-for-advanced-manufacturing"&gt;Advanced Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; Supply Chain Initiative and recently re-launched the Manufacturing Advisory Service.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It complements our Make it in Great Britain campaign, which is working to change the perceptions of modern manufacturing and challenge views that we don’t make anything in this country anymore.”   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focus on Enforcement looks at chemical manufacturing</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/your-experiences-of-dealing-with-regulators/"&gt;second review for the government’s Focus on Enforcement campaign&lt;/a&gt; is now up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next six weeks, businesses involved in chemicals manufacturing and storage can share their experiences of working with national regulators and local authorities. Your experience with regulators might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with paperwork &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inspections &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;advice from regulators you come into contact with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to hear how the way regulations are enforced can be improved, reduced or done differently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Mark Prisk Minister welcomed the launch of the new review and said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will give businesses in the chemicals sector the chance to make a real difference to the way compliance and protection is achieved on COMAH sites, shaping how companies can best work with regulators in a successful and cost-effective way.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want companies in this area of business, and those that advise and assist them, to visit the website, to tell us their views and suggest how we might reduce enforcement burdens and share best practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is your chance to make a real difference to the way these regulations are enforced.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses in other sectors continue to have the chance to make a real difference to the way regulators do their work in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in a different business sector and would like to suggest we look at how enforcement in your area of business could be improved, you can also share your ideas, and the best suggestions will guide ministers in prioritising future reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
