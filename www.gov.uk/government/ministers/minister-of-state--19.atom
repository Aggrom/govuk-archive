    <title>Foreign Office Minister condemns bombings in Baghdad and Nasiriya</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was appalled to learn of the attack on Shia pilgrims in Nasiriya which has killed and maimed so many people, and of the bombings in Baghdad earlier today. We denounce and condemn these atrocities in the strongest terms. Our prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of these innocent civilians killed or injured in today’s attacks.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I urge the political parties and leadership to renew their efforts to break the current political impasse so that together they can focus on the reconstruction of Iraq and bring security and stability and raised quality of life to its citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
