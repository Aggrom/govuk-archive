    <title>Foreign Office Minister deeply concerned by conflict in Burma</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Rt Hon Hugo Swire MP expressed dismay today at the ongoing violence in Kachin state in Burma.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Rt Hon Hugo Swire MP said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict between the Burmese Army and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in Burma’s Kachin State, including recent reports of air strikes in the state. An escalation in hostilities would put at risk the chance of a lasting peace in Burma. It is imperative that military commanders in Burma heed their President’s calls for an end to hostilities. I raised these concerns with the Burmese government during my visit last month. It is important that all sides, including the KIA, come to the negotiating table and make renewed efforts to work towards lasting peace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During my meetings with the Burmese government I highlighted the importance of normalising the role of the Burmese military. Lasting democratic reform in Burma will not be successful unless they come under the direct authority of the Burmese government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK continues to support the peace process in Burma directly. We are working with experts with experience of inter-communal trust and peace-building in Northern Ireland to encourage Burma’s own reconciliation efforts. The UK is also contributing £3.5 million in humanitarian food aid for civilians displaced by fighting across Kachin State, including in non-government controlled areas. During my visit I stressed the importance of allowing the unhindered supply of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population. We will continue to work closely with humanitarian partners to monitor needs in the event of any further civilian displacement.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Office Minister condemns bombings in Baghdad and Nasiriya</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Minister for the Middle East and North Africa Alistair Burt gave a statement on the attack on Shia pilgrims in Nasiriya and the bombings in Baghdad today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was appalled to learn of the attack on Shia pilgrims in Nasiriya which has killed and maimed so many people, and of the bombings in Baghdad earlier today. We denounce and condemn these atrocities in the strongest terms. Our prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of these innocent civilians killed or injured in today’s attacks.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I urge the political parties and leadership to renew their efforts to break the current political impasse so that together they can focus on the reconstruction of Iraq and bring security and stability and raised quality of life to its citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
