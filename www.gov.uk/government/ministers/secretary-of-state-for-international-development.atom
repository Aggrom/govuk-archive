    <title>A164 improvements get the go-ahead</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on multi-million pound improvements to the A164 Humber Bridge to Beverley route in East Riding of Yorkshire can now start, Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvements work, worth £10m, will mean that four of the roundabouts along the A164 will have capacity improvements and a section of the A164 will also be dualled. There will also be a continuous footway/cycleway between Humber Bridge and Beverley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that the scheme will help tackle the traffic congestion on the A164 and provide more reliable journey times, as well as providing better and more reliable access to the International Hub and Humber Ports Complex and other areas and communities along the A164 route corridor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justine Greening said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a massively important road in East Riding and these improvements are going to make a big difference to local people and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Investment like this shows just how determined this government is to tackle the congestion on our roads which holds motorists up every day. It is good for the environment and good for jobs and growth too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme was one of 20 given initial approval in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement last year. Work can now start on the main construction works, with the road scheduled to open in March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today’s announcement grants Full (final) Approval to the A164 Humber Bridge to Beverley Route Improvement scheme enabling work to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new road is scheduled to open in March 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department will provide £7.7 million towards the full scheme cost of £10.03 million.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The scheme consists of capacity improvements to four of the roundabouts along the A164 - Willerby Roundabout, Sorts Centre Roundabout, Castle Hill Roundabout and skidby Roundabout; dualling of a 1.4km section of the A164 between Willerby and Castle Hill Roundabouts; Continuous footway/cycleway between the Humber Bridge and Beverley; and Road safety improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
