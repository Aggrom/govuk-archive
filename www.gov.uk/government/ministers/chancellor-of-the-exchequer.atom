    <title>Government investment in local growth to continue</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Chancellor has announced a package of measures in his Autumn Statement that will help the department continue to boost local growth.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures will enable the country to build new homes, deliver key infrastructure and support vital jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new £474 million Local Infrastructure Fund that will support investment in key local projects will open up new development, including locally supported large housing sites and bring surplus public land back into use, delivering much needed new homes, businesses, infrastructure and local transport schemes. Plus a further £100 million to bring forward public sector sites for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures announced in the Autumn Statement and the September Housing and Planning package will support delivery of up to 120,000 homes. There will also be cash injections for local areas through a £1.5 billion borrowing arrangement for local enterprise partnerships and more money for the Regional Growth Fund. While small firms will continue to receive larger business rate tax breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-investment-in-local-infrastructure"&gt;New investment in local infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around £225 million will be used to accelerate delivery of locally supported large housing sites, supporting around 50,000 homes. There are many locally supported large housing schemes in the development pipeline that can provide real benefits to local communities that are struggling to move forward because of the current economic circumstances. This fund will help unlock those stalled sites so they become shovel ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around £190 million of the funding will be used to enable the quicker disposal of surplus public sector land for new homes. Alongside this, the Government will provide £100 million to bring forward public sector sites for development. Government has identified enough land for over 106,000 homes and has already sold around 33,000. The Home and Communities Agency will become a single ‘shop window’ for land disposal so much needed homes can be built on these sites sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around £60 million of this will be made available to support infrastructure in a limited number of enterprise zones. Building work has already begun on 20 zones and the majority have put in place simplified planning arrangements and secured private sector investment. The fund will help accelerate the infrastructure preparations so that new businesses can open and more new jobs are created as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from Lord Heseltine’s report which recommended devolution of more economic powers, local enterprise partnerships will be able to borrow up to £1.5 billion at cheap rates for nominated infrastructure projects. This puts partnerships and councils in much greater control over the levers of growth. They are already putting the Growing Places Fund to good use supporting 169 projects in the first 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will also pump an additional £350 million into the Regional Growth Fund, including a new £210 million to support jobs and growth across England - bringing the total fund to £2.6 billion. In addition, a new £170 million Department for Transport local transport pinch point fund, to unlock new development, homes and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="extra-support-for-business-continues"&gt;Extra support for business continues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the need to tackle the deficit there continues to be no real terms increases in business rates and inflation has fallen easing pressure further. The government will provide a further one year extension of the temporary doubling of small business rate relief to an estimated half a million business properties. In addition councils can now offer extra discounts to support local business and the 24 enterprise zones offer special 100% rate discounts to new firms that create local jobs. Postponing a revaluation will avoid local firms and local shops facing unexpected hikes in their business-rates bills over the next 5 years. Early estimates suggest that 800,000 premises faced a real-terms rise in their bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chancellor also announced a new temporary measure to extend the time period for the exemption from empty property rates, for newly built property for 18 months which will support construction. This will help promote regeneration and support high street renewal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="efficiency-savings-to-continue"&gt;Efficiency savings to continue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the government’s fiscal plans the new investment in the economy will, in part, be funded by some government departments’ resource budgets being reduced. The Department for Communites and Local Government has already become a smaller, streamlined, more flexible organisation. Its administration spending will reduce in real terms by 44% having reduced headcount by 37%. Arms length bodies have been reduced from 26 to 13 and the government office regions have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local government has been exempt from the reduction in 2013-2014 in recognition that local authorities are holding down budgets by comparable amounts by keeping council tax low in that year. This important concession will allow local authorities time in 2013-2014 to continue to protect frontline services by delivering reforms that will drive through further savings through transforming service delivery as demonstrated by the whole-place community budget pilots. Full details of local government funding for next year will be announced in the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement due later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Autumn Statement 2012</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>What the Autumn Statement means for Business, Innovation and Skills.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Autumn Statement is one of two major statements the Treasury has to give to Parliament every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Statement provides an update on the government’s plans for the economy based on the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. These forecasts are published alongside the Autumn Statement on 5 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this update of the government’s spending plans, the Department for Business has secured £2.4 billion of additional funding to support growth, with a focus on skills and science projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This money reinforces the government’s commitment to plan for medium and long term recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will aid the development of an industrial strategy to shape and rebalance our economy, in partnership with business. This will drive growth, create the jobs of the future and help us get ahead in the global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="main-announcements-for-bis"&gt;Main announcements for BIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional £600 million for science, research and innovation, which takes the total investment since the 2010 spending review to an additional £1.5 billion. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £270 million to be spent on laboratories, classrooms and other facilities in our Further Education colleges. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1 billion confirmed for the business bank, which will address the long-term structural gap in lending to small businesses. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £120 million invested in supply chains, to encourage companies to invest here in the UK. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Regional Growth Fund will also receive an additional £310 million, bringing the total available from April 2013 to £2.6 billion. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first stage of the government’s response to Lord Heseltine’s independent review on economic growth, ‘No Stone Unturned’. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra money for the Employer Ownership Pilot, taking it to £340 million overall and giving businesses funding so they can design and develop their own training programmes. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased funding of £140 million for UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) to help small and medium sized business export abroad. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1.5 billion to help our smallest companies to access growing markets overseas. For the first time UK Export Finance, the Government’s export credit agency, will be able to issue loans to overseas customers and buyers wanting to purchase goods from UK businesses. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A package of measures to cut back red tape that business has told government stops them from growing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-and-innovation"&gt;Science and Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Spending Review in 2010 the yearly £4.6 billion funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms and ring-fenced during the spending review period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £600 million announced today will be invested in facilities for technological research and development and Research Council infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amounts to an additional £1.5 billion of capital funding for science, research and innovation since the beginning of the Review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment will support the development of innovative technologies and strengthen the UK‘s competitive advantage in areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big data and energy efficient computing. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced materials. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details about how the £600 million will be spent will be published in due course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science budget will continue to be protected and ring-fenced for the rest of the Spending Review. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2011 Budget: Britain open for business</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has announced measures in the 2011 Budget to make the UK the most attractive destination in Europe for businesses and investment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing the 2011 Budget, the Chancellor George Osborne outlined the Government’s financial priorities for strong, sustainable and balanced growth across all regions and sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britain open for business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor outlined the Government’s strategy to position the UK at the forefront of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this ambition, the Government has created a package of measures to ensure the most competitive tax system in the G20; make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business; encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy; and create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Budget will also boost development in advanced manufacturing, life sciences and creative industries to enhance the UK’s performance as a world leader in science, research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures announced today included a 1 per cent cut in corporation tax from April 2011 to 26 per cent, 9 university centres for innovation, 21 new enterprise zones and tax support for Research and Development, particularly for small companies. An additional £2 billion in funding for the Green Investment Bank was also announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes to non-domicile taxation rules in this Budget also aim to ensure that the UK remains a competitive destination for businesses and foreign investors. New Controlled Foreign Company rules will allow groups based in the UK to compete more effectively with those based overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want Britain to be the place international businesses go to, not the place they leave. Let it be heard clearly around the world - from Shanghai to Seattle, and from Stuttgart to Sao Paolo: Britain is open for Business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So this is our plan for growth. We want the words: ‘Made in Britain, Created in Britain, Designed in Britain, Invented in Britain’ to drive our nation forward. A Britain carried aloft by the march of the makers. That is how we will create jobs…We have put fuel into the tank of the British economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and India: A new economic partnership</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rt Hon George Osborne MP Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai Wednesday 28 July 2010.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check against delivery&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Mr Bhatt for the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank the Indian Banks’ Association, as well as UK Trade and Investment, for hosting this speech and Mr O P Bhatt for his welcome&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a real pleasure to be back in Mumbai today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was last here in 2006, when David Cameron the new Prime Minister and I came to meet with and talk to the leading figures of Indian business and politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back from that trip we resolved that if ever we formed a Government we would return with a large delegation to enhance this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visit just 10 weeks after we formed the Government makes good on that promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, this is the strongest and most high-profile British delegation to visit India in modern times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes six senior ministers - alongside the Prime Minister David Cameron and myself, we are joined by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The Business Secretary Vince Cable;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The Foreign Secretary William Hague;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The Minister for the Environment and Climate Change Greg Barker;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• And the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it took one of my predecessors as Chancellor ten years to visit India, I have made it a priority to come here in my first ten weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our delegation also includes leading figures from British business, sports and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top chief executives of some of the world’s best-known businesses, like Vodafone, BAe, and Rolls Royce, and leading financial sector firms, including Barclays, Standard Chartered, Deutsche, Clifford Chance, Aviva, Standard Life, and the London Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior academics from Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and our other universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural leaders like the directors of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the British Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sporting figures, such as Olympic medal winners Sebastian Coe, Kelly Holmes and Stephen Redgrave to see the new facilities for the Commonwealth Games. Next time I will bring some cricketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the scale of our visit is very deliberate. A large scale  demonstration of how serious we are about India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain’s new coalition Government is here to renew and strengthen the partnership between our two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our shared interests, shared values, shared sense of threats and ever-burgeoning personal and business ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s economic success within the framework of a secular and plural democracy is of strategic importance to all open societies and all open economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a vital stake in India’s rise to global power and prosperity and we are here to listen and to learn, to find out how our strong relationship can grow stronger still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to talk today about those three core ingredients which I believe are needed in this new enhanced economic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are, first, greater efforts to improve trade and investment flows between our countries - a partnership in trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a deeper understanding of the links between our financial services sectors - a partnership in finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And third, a better recognition of our shared goals on the international economic policy stage - a partnership for the world economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say a few words about each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with our trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe our two countries have much to gain from expanding our trade relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, this has been a disappointing aspect of our bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and India have slipped down the rankings of each other’s trading partners - we could and should be doing much more with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, India was only the 19th most important source of foreign goods for the UK market and the 12thmost important source of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, the UK was India’s fourth most important source of imported goods. By 2009, we had fallen to being the 18th largest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the UK has been losing its share of India’s booming trade with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is all too easy to set eye-catching targets that disappear without trace once the headlines have gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2007, when the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer visited India, he promised great things for the bilateral trade relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon Brown announced that he aimed to double exports to India by 2010 - that is to say this year - and to quadruple exports by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A noble ambition, but easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of UK exports of goods stood at £2.7bn at the time of that announcement; by 2009, it had reached just £2.9bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a stretch for us to reach the target of doubling exports in what remains of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we want to make progress on free trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must make every effort to complete the Doha trade round. And we should ask trade experts to report to G20 leaders on steps to achieve this before the Seoul G20 Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should strengthen significantly EU-India trade links. Indeed, an ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and India will generate jobs and growth by tackling the unnecessary barriers to trade and investment between our regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, it could deliver benefits worth a combined €4.5bn per annum shared between India and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are now entering their fourth year. We need to provide the leadership to complete the free trade agreement by early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must reduce the costs of trade - particularly the frictions and delays at borders -which are often a far larger barrier to market access than tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank estimates that a 2 percent reduction in the costs of doing trade is equivalent to an ambitious Doha deal on tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to do more, and do better, on trade between our two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to build on what has already been achieved. There is a strong investment base:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• 700 out of 1,200 Indian firms in the European Union operate from within the UK;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The largest single manufacturing employer in the UK is the Indian conglomerate Tata, which owns Jaguar, Land Rover and in the constituency I represent Brunner Mond;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• And the UK receives over 10 per cent of India’s outward investment flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to investment, ours is not a one-way relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the UK stock of inward investment is the fourth largest in India, the UK’s share of foreign direct investment has been declining. I want to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I launched Vodafone’s solar powered mobile phone, and exchanged greetings with a village head in Jharkhand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating from a mobile phone shop in Mumbai directly to a village a thousand miles away - this is the scale of the change in which is taking place in India and in which British companies can participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of India have set out ambitious plans for $500bn infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a massive opportunity for British engineers, architects, designers and construction firms to strengthen cooperation further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome that the Government of India is taking forward positive proposals for foreign insurers and pension funds to play a role in delivering this finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should bring together the Chief Executives from the UK and India to identify how we can further improve collaboration in this area and we will do more of that in Delhi tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need an enhanced trade and investment partnership. We also need to strengthen our partnership in financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the second crucial element of an enhanced economic relationship - the increasing importance of the financial links between our two economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of access to finance is a major barrier to poverty reduction all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British banks are fully committed to the Government of India’s financial inclusion agenda and to the challenge of serving the needs of poorer communities in rural areas and smaller towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are here for the long haul. Indeed some UK banks have been in India for over 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered, HSBC and RBS are three of the top four foreign retail banks in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer British banks licences in the medium-sized towns and smaller cities and other British banks will jump at the opportunity to be part of the huge effort to bring modern banking services to millions more Indians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just look at what they are already doing - Standard Chartered and HSBC have extensive networks of more than 100 branches between them covering 31 cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to see British banks doing more to help India increase its financial capacity so that access to capital is not a brake on India’s economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Confederation of Indian Industry report published this month noted that foreign banks held only 8.5 per cent of the banking sector’s assets and that this limited the country’s ability to secure higher investment growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s also be clear about something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential that we learn the lessons of the world banking crisis and create financial systems that support growth rather than put it at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s attention to macro-prudential risks enabled it to weather the storm better than the UK and other economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK I have announced a new approach to financial regulation, including a stronger focus on macro-prudential risks to the financial system as a whole, stronger regulation of individual firms by the Bank of England, and enhanced consumer protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know from my conversation this morning with Reserve Bank of India Governor Subbarao, how much both our countries have to gain from sharing our experiences in macro-prudential regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to strengthening our cooperation as we both develop our global financial centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Governor said in his speech to the Indian Merchant’s Chamber, the Indian banking system will become increasingly international, with Indian banks increasing their presence abroad and foreign banks taking a larger presence in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has seen tremendous benefits from the liberalisation of the financial sector, as I saw this morning at the Bombay Stock Exchange.&lt;br&gt;
The dynamism of India’s capital and equity markets demonstrate the potential for other parts of the financial sector: for example in banking, through the implementation of the reforms set out in the RBI’s 2005 Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in insurance, by following through on India’s welcome commitment to raise the cap on foreign investment from 26% to 49%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have another key message for financial regulators and financial institutions here in this great financial centre of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is this - I believe in reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to see Indian banks establishing themselves even more prominently as big players in the City of London and throughout the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian financial services firms are increasingly active in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently 9 Indian banks in the UK and all of them are growing and all have plans to open more branches in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is now home to more Indian banks than any other country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very much welcome the fact that the India Infrastructure Finance Company based itself in London - a move symbolic of the depth of the financial services relationship between our two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pleased to announce today that Exim Bank, India’s premier development bank for trade and investment, has been given a license from the FSA to set up their bank in the UK - bringing that number to 10 Indian banks and with more to follow in the future I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to announce that the State Bank of India, the oldest commercial bank in this country, will be making London their European Headquarters this year and will be adding to their network of branches across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the kind of reciprocity our banking sectors need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would welcome the arrival of more Indian banks in the UK as well as the expansion of the existing players already serving customers the length and breadth of my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we will develop a partnership in finance to complement the new partnership in trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these will together help us form a new partnership for the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s policies of trade and investment liberalisation are reintegrating India into the world economy, allowing it to regain an influence it had three centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once famously quoted Victor Hugo saying that ‘no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of India as a major economic power in the world is certainly one such idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why it is time to acknowledge that the post-1945 system of international financial institutions - particularly the IMF and the World Bank - needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was built for a world of closed economies and just 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world in which relative economic power is shifting eastwards, we urgently need modernisation and reform.&lt;br&gt;
We need a new global financial architecture that reflects the re-emergence of India and as linchpin powers in the world economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need institutions that have the resources, the tools and the legitimacy to ensure countries can withstand economic shocks and prevent crises from spreading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Enhancing IMF resources - and I am pleased that this week the UK Parliament ratified our commitment to provide extra resources to the IMF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Improving the IMF’s crisis prevention tools;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• And completing the reform to IMF quotas to give greater weight to under-represented and dynamic economies. I am determined the UK will take a lead this autumn in making sure India is fairly represented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need institutions that reflect the huge changes that have been taking place in the world economy, not ones that mask them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India now has a strategic stake in multilateralism that it did not have for much of the post-war period.&lt;br&gt;
The UK supports the G20’s emergence as the pre-eminent global grouping, in which the world’s largest economies work together to create a global order that is supportive of our mutual aspirations and ambitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• coordinating macroeconomic policies and agreeing actions in each G20 country to ensure sustainability and foster global growth;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• implementing reforms to strengthen the global financial system, in particular improving the quality and quantity of capital;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• and resisting protectionism and promoting open markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential that India can play the significant role in these debates to which it is entitled because of the size and dynamism of its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just about multilateral relations. I also want our bilateral relationship to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not make this visit and these conversations a one-off, but rather ensure that:&lt;br&gt;
• we meet annually;&lt;br&gt;
• follow through on summit agreements;&lt;br&gt;
• expand the dialogue to include other government ministries and regulators;&lt;br&gt;
• and strengthen the involvement from the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me conclude by saying that India’s success is of strategic importance not just to the UK, but to all open societies and open economies and the UK is determined to do all it can to be a partner in your success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can be strong partners in trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can be strong partners in finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And through this, we will be strong partners in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Mobile banking is having global impact</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Monitise/Visa Indian joint venture hailed by the British  Chancellor in Mumbai visit.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widespread emergence of mobile banking is having a huge transformative effect in both developed and emerging economies, a pioneering ‘mobile money’ business leader said today in Mumbai, India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Johnson, group strategy director of Monitise plc, said: “For the full potential of mobile banking and payments to be achieved, banks, payments networks and mobile network operators have realised that they must come together in partnership and collaboration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of collaboration will revolutionise the way people manage their money, and the effects will be felt worldwide, Mr Johnson added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of mobile money networks will give people instant access to their finances on their mobile phone and enable them to conduct a multitude of transactions on the move, as well as having access to news and business information - and the social and economic impact will be dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bank account holders will be able to manage their finances easily and securely anywhere in the world, transfer funds and purchase items  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile phone users can turn the handset into a ‘mobile wallet’ topped up with cash, enabling them to transfer money wirelessly and make payments in seconds&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Johnson, speaking to banking and telecoms leaders in Mumbai, continued: “Whether it is a consumer with multiple bank accounts who needs to stay in constant touch with their balance, or a mobile phone user who has never been in a bank or has no previous financial relationship, it is clear that India, steered by the progressive approach of the Reserve Bank, can lead the way in providing mobile financial access.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;India has the world’s second largest population (1.1bn people) with 200 million of a 600 million working population having bank accounts - while almost 600 million have a mobile phone  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 91% of the US $703 billion spent by Indians annually is in the form of cash  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2005 study by the London Business School found that an increase of 10 mobile phones per 100 people in African developing countries would increase GDP growth by 0.6%&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitise has helped to pioneer mobile banking around the world and been recognised as a ‘Technology Pioneer’ by the World Economic Forum for its ability to help engage people in developing countries into the banking and financial system. Previous winners included Google and Skype.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has just launched a joint venture in India with Visa, one of the world’s leading global payments technology companies, to accelerate the delivery of mobile financial services such as banking, bill payments, mass transit ticketing, mobile top-up and others to Indian consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Monitise is also developing mobile banking services in India with Standard Chartered Bank, with services for SCB’s customers expected to go live in the next twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Johnson was speaking today at a reception to inaugurate the joint venture with Visa, attended by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who was leading a government delegation to India with the British prime minister David Cameron and foreign secretary William Hague.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address Mr Osborne stressed the importance of trade between India and the UK and praised Monitise as an example of a British business exporting its innovation and expertise overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said:  “India is renowned for its world class innovation and its technology and financial services sectors are enviable. So it is great to see an entrepreneurial and innovative British company like Monitise exporting its skills and expertise to India and creating new, strong partnerships here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joint venture between Monitise and Visa will initially offer balance inquiries, bill payments, and ticket purchases e.g. train, airline, cinema through participating partners, before diversifying into mobile money for the ‘unbanked’, and electronic transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Government to explore new and innovative ways for business to access finance.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chancellor &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/profile_cx.htm"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt; and Business Secretary &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//ministers/vince-cable"&gt;Vince Cable&lt;/a&gt; have launched a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//Consultations/financing-private-sector-recovery"&gt;Green Paper on business finance&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper starts a consultation with business on ways to access funding to help them expand and create new jobs to grow the economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government recognises that companies face a range of problems in accessing finance and wants to work with business and financial sectors to find solutions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard the problems businesses are facing in getting bank loans up and down the country. They need innovative ways to access finance from other sources to grow our firms and economy. That’s why this green paper is so important as we look to help viable firms get the money they need.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As the economy recovers, it is crucial to ensure that the supply of finance supports rather than constrains demand and business confidence. If businesses are to play their part in promoting economic recovery it is important that they are able to access a diverse range of finance choices in a stable macroeconomic environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Budget creates conditions for enterprise and growth</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has set out his Budget with a comprehensive five-year plan to rebuild the British economy.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan sets out action to tackle the unprecedented budget deficit, introduce a fairer tax system, encourage enterprise and support long-term growth across the economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor wants to support business and make the UK more competitive. This means giving businesses more freedom by reducing regulation and providing targeted tax breaks, while ensuring that the economic opportunities for businesses are shared more evenly throughout the UK’s regions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A major package of reforms to reduce corporation tax rates including a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28 per cent to 24 per cent over the course of four financial years from April 2011 and reductions to the main and special rates of capital allowances from April 2012. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A reduction in the small profits rate from 21 per cent to 20 per cent from April 2011 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A National Insurance Contributions (NICs) holiday for new businesses which start-up in certain areas of the UK over the next three years. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An increase in the Enterprise Finance Guarantee and the creation of a new Enterprise Capital Fund. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Regional Growth Fund in 2010-11 and 2012-13 to support increases in business employment and growth. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 10 per cent rate of capital gains tax for entrepreneurial business activities will be extended from the first £2 million to the first £5 million of qualifying gains made over a lifetime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other BIS related measures include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A review of the employment laws, by each relevant Department that will start immediately, to ensure maximum flexibility, protect fairness and promote competition &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stripping back regulation and introducing sunset clauses on all new regulations &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consultation on how to phase out the Default Retirement Age &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Injecting private capital into Royal Mail, including opportunities for employee ownership &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Release of spectrum to support super-fast mobile broadband services &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examining options for realising value from the student loan portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable told Sky News:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The deficit has got to be dealt with through a combination of taxes, spending cuts and economic growth. Growth will not happen automatically. The Budget gives incentives to companies to take on new employees. When you ask businesspeople what they want, their first request is to sort out the public finances.”&lt;/p&gt;
