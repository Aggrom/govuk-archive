    <title>Written Ministerial Statement on Foreign Office public records</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 5 December 2011, I informed the House of our plans to make a large collection of colonial administration files available to the public over a 2 year period (Official Record column 6WS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have today made the fourth tranche of files available for the public to view at The National Archives (TNA) at Kew. This marks the half way point. I am pleased to confirm that we remain on track to complete the transfer of the entire collection of files to TNA by the end of 2013 as per the schedule published on the FCO website. As promised, we have kept redactions to an absolute minimum. I am very grateful to the Independent Reviewer, Professor Anthony Badger, for overseeing this work with such care and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains the case that the FCO is still unable to confirm the existence or destruction of 170 boxes of Top Secret colonial administration files known to have been returned to the UK. There is some evidence that the Singapore Top Secret colonial administration files were destroyed as part of a review of FCO post files in the 1990s. The FCO continues to search for these files or for further evidence of their destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work on the colonial files has, regrettably, caused a short-term backlog in the regular annual transfer of some FCO departmental files from 1981 and 1982. Additional staff resource has been allocated to tackle this. We will publish on the FCO website a timetable to transfer the remaining 1981 and 1982 files between 2013 and 2015.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his statement to the House on 5 May 2011 (Official Report, column 24WS), my Right Honourable Friend the Foreign Secretary undertook to implement in full the recommendations of the Cary review into the colonial administration files.  These included an up to date inventory of the FCO’s archival holdings. This has brought to light a large accumulation of other material outside the FCO departmental file series, much of which is over 30 years old and therefore overdue for review.  The FCO has not identified any colonial administration files amongst these papers beyond those currently being transferred. In keeping with this Government’s commitment to transparency, we will be publishing a copy of the high level inventory of these “Special Collections” on the FCO website. We remain fully committed both to complying with our public records obligations and to doing so with maximum transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Kosovo offered membership to European Bank of Reconstruction and Development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Europe, David Lidington, has welcomed the decision on 16 November by the Governors of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to offer membership to the Republic of Kosovo.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lidington said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome yesterday’s decision by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to offer membership to the Republic of Kosovo. EBRD membership will help Kosovo in its efforts to achieve greater socio-economic development, prosperity and stability for all its citizens.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the latest example of Kosovo’s progress towards becoming fully integrated into the international community. The UK will remain strong supporters of Kosovo’s efforts towards this goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Written Ministerial Statement on the Foreign Affairs Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs will attend the Foreign Affairs Council on the afternoon of 19 November. My Right Honourable Friend the Minister for International Security Strategy will attend the European Defence Agency Steering Board and the Defence Foreign Affairs Council on the morning of 19 November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a joint lunch for Foreign and Defence Ministers to consider the issues outlined below. These meetings will be held in Brussels and will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will attend the General Affairs Council on 20 November, and the preceding dinner with President Van Rompuy on 19 November. The meeting will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the EDA Steering Board, Ministers will be expected to agree as usual the EDA’s budget and work programme for the forthcoming year and its indicative work plan for the next 3 years.  Also on the agenda are the EDA’s approach to pooling and sharing and the defence contribution to the development of EU policies. The Pooling and Sharing Report gives a progress update of ongoing activity such as the Helicopter Training Programme and Maritime Surveillance Networking, proposes new opportunities for pooling and sharing, and includes the Code of Conduct for Pooling and Sharing which Ministers are expected to adopt. Ministers will be updated on EDA work on the interaction between defence and wider EU policies such as Industry and Market, Research and Innovation and European Space Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda is expected to focus on EU Operations and the Defence Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Operations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session on EU operations should open with an update on the current state of play in each of the EU’s CSDP (Common Security and Defence Policy) operations. It is anticipated that discussion could then focus on the future of the EU Training Mission in Somalia. The UK is supportive of a third mandate for EUTM Somalia, so we will look to push for extension of the mandate and to set out our thinking on the design of that mandate. The Mali operation is the subject of a specific discussion during the joint lunch, so we do not expect it to be discussed during this session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Task Force&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will receive an update from the European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services on the EU Defence Task Force’s efforts in supporting competitiveness, and on innovation of the European defence industry within the internal market. The Defence Task Force is an internal EU Commission body co-chaired by the Commission’s DG Market and DG Enterprise, established in 2011 to identify measures to improve the internal defence market and improve the European defence industrial base.  It is focused on the three main areas of the internal market, the Commission’s Defence Industry Policy and defence research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence and Foreign Ministers Lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mali   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over an informal lunch, Ministers will discuss the draft Crisis Management Concept being drawn up as part of the planning process for a CSDP mission to Mali. We do not expect Conclusions to be issued from the lunch. This is an opportunity for the UK to express its support for accelerated planning towards a CSDP mission while ensuring that due rigour is applied to that planning process.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2013 European Council on Defence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will have an orientation debate on CSDP ahead of the 2013 European Council on defence. The December 2012 European Council will commission the relevant EU institutions to conduct preparatory work through the course of 2013. The discussion at the FAC will centre on this tasking. We welcome the European Council looking at this issue and will be pushing for a tasking framed around enhancing European military effectiveness and a more efficient European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review developments in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Egypt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are likely to discuss recent events in Syria and their impact on EU efforts to support a peaceful transition. The UK is pushing for agreement to the full renewal of the EU’s restrictive measures on Syria which come up for renewal on 1 December, and will encourage other Member States to increase their humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Lebanon, following the bomb attack in Beirut on 19 October, we expect Conclusions which will condemn that attack and reiterate the EU’s strong commitment to Lebanon’s stability and independence. The Conclusions will reiterate the EU’s support for the work of the Lebanese Armed Forces and urge all Lebanese parties to engage in the dialogue being led by President Sleiman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may take stock of recent events in Libya, including the appointment of Prime Minister-elect Ali Zidan and progress in the approval of his government. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Egypt, the Council will discuss follow-up to the EU-Egypt Task Force in Cairo which takes place on 13-14 November. The Task Force is a key moment in resetting the EU’s relationship with Egypt. We will continue to encourage greater emphasis on the principles of more-for-more in the follow-up to it, in line with EU ambition to use the ENP to incentivise reform. The Task Force will also discuss work, including in the UK, to improve repatriation of assets stolen from transition countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yemen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is almost one year since the transition process in Yemen began with the signing of the Gulf Co-operation Council Initiative on 23 November 2011. The transition remains broadly on track, with President Hadi successfully appointed after an interim election in February, and the formation of a national unity government. The proposed Conclusions would show our support for these efforts but also encourage the Yemenis to continue in this vein through the successful preparation and launch of an inclusive National Dialogue, and preparations for full national elections in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East Peace Process discussions will focus on the prospect of a Palestinian application to the UN General Assembly to upgrade their status to that of a non-member observer state. The UK will emphasise the need for EU countries to vote in a manner which advances our shared goal of realising the two state solution. We will make clear that we are encouraging the new US administration to act quickly to put its full weight behind ensuring the Israelis and Palestinians return to substantive negotiations resulting in the resolution of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be an in-depth discussion of Ukraine following the parliamentary elections on 28 October. The discussion will consider how to take forward the EU-Ukraine relationship in the light of the elections and other developments.  We do not expect there to be Conclusions in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are expected to agree Conclusions which will highlight our concerns about the insecurity in eastern DRC; condemn the actions of M23 and other armed groups; call for the cessation of all outside support for M23; and underline the importance of the government of the DRC showing leadership in resolving the problems. Ministers will also have the opportunity to consider what steps should be taken next to help to resolve the situation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the current situation in Cuba and the future of EU-Cuba relations. EU-Cuba relations are currently governed by the 1996 Common Position, which can be &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996E0697:EN:NOT"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU-US&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama. We expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy. We will stress the importance of an EU-US trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key item of discussion will be the preparation for the November European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The General Affairs Council (GAC) has led on the preparation of the MFF, which has been discussed at every GAC over the past year. Key issues such as the overall size of the MFF 2014-20 and the composition of spend in the different headings will be taken forward to the November European Council.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the MFF we expect this GAC to discuss the Commission’s work programme for 2013, follow up on the agreements reached at the October European Council and the agenda for the December European Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiannual Financial Framework&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers will focus initially on issues around Cohesion policy, on which the Presidency hopes to secure a partial general approach on two remaining negotiating blocks: financial management, and the common strategic framework. Financial management deals with the processes for examination and acceptance of accounts and for financial corrections. The Common Strategic Framework is an annex to the Common Provisions Regulation which provides a strategic orientation at EU level for the funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main item will be preparation for the special November European Council on 22 and 23 November. This will be discussed at a dinner with President Van Rompuy on 19 November and again during the Tuesday 20 November session.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency has produced various iterations of the ‘negotiating box’ which now has an upper ceiling of numbers for the MFF. The Presidency has made it clear that they expect further downward revisions and I will be arguing that the upper ceiling is far too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect a further version of the negotiating box to be issued before the GAC. This will be &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/special-reports/mff/negotiating-box"&gt;available here.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be emphasising the strength of feeling on budget size in the UK as demonstrated by the recent vote in the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also emphasise again that we will not agree to any changes to Own Resources, including the UK abatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow up to the October European Council and agenda for December European Council&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the October European Council the Commission was urged to make progress on implementation of the Growth Compact and to speed up delivery on growth enhancing measures such as concluding trade agreements. The Commission have indicated that they will undertake to put proposals on a range of issues on the table before the end of the year. I will urge the Commission to press forward on the issues we consider priorities, including the annual growth survey and the internal energy market, but also to maintain momentum in other areas such as the trade agenda, where the need for progress was highlighted in particular in the October European Council. I will emphasise the need for progress on trade deals with Singapore, Japan, Canada and also the United States, which the Prime Minister discussed with President Obama when they spoke after his re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Europe David Lidington visits Sweden</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden is a key strategic partner for the UK; we share common goals, views and values across a broad spectrum, from Europe to trade to defence.  Sweden shares UK interests over single market, financial services, Eurozone ins and outs, enlargement and global free trade, as well as reform of the EU.  UK and Sweden are also close economic and trading partners - in 2011 Sweden was UK’s 10 largest export market and the UK was Sweden’s 3rd largest export market.  Given the breadth of the overlap, the Minister had much to talk about with his Swedish partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister Lidington discussed UK-Sweden co-operation on key EU issues, including Eurozone, Banking Union, Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and Future of Europe with EU Minister Birgitta Ohlsson.  In his meeting with Foreign Minister Carl Bildt he discussed foreign policy issues, including Iran, Syria and Russia, as well as the EU’s Eastern partnership, particularly Ukraine and Belarus, and EU enlargement with focus on Western Balkans and Turkey.  Focus for the Minister’s meeting with State Secretaries from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Finance Ministry was key EU economic/financial issues, such as Eurozone, Banking Union and MFF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister also spoke at UI/The Swedish Institute of International Affairs on the future of Europe and how the EU can develop politically, economically and institutionally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Membership of the euro is not an essential part of what it means to be an EU member.  We want a Europe that respects its diversity; members that want to integrate on different subjects.  We need arrangements that ensure EU institutions are accountable to and work for all member states, not just a subset of member states.  There is now a sub-debate on what architecture is right for a more diverse EU.  We need to make it possible for the EU to develop in a way that recognises member state diversity.  For that we do not need to change treaties but apply subsidiarity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is in UK’s interest to be an active member of the EU, for example for the single market, the single voice in trade and foreign policy co-operation.  How effective member states such as the UK and Sweden can be outside the Eurozone, depends in part on culture and in part on rules in the EU, and the treaties.  We must safeguard the single market of the 27 in the treaties.  There are many like-minded groups on issues that do not follow this divide, e.g. on the single market or on trade.  All member states must be treated on an equal basis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before returning to London Minister Lidington met the visiting Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and EU Minister from Kosovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Europe visits Yerevan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The UK highly values its relationship with Armenia as we mark twenty years of our relations”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the meeting with the President both sides stressed importance of Armenian-UK bilateral relations. Serzh Sargsyan expressed his hope that the visit of Mr. Lidington would become an impetus for the strengthening of the relations and deepening of cooperation between two countries. He highlighted the importance of cooperation between Armenia and Great Britain in the framework of relations with the European Union. Mr. Lidington mentioned that the UK is deeply grateful for the contribution that Armenia continues to make to the peace-keeping forces in Afghanistan and was impressed by the progress Armenia had made in developing closer ties with the EU and NATO.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Receiving David Lidington in Armenian Government building the Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan stressed that the level of the Armenian-British economic cooperation is increasing and in this context. He also briefed the Minister on the reforms taking place in Armenia, directed at the development of small and medium businesses, reduction of tax and customs administration and creation of free economic zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office Minister said that he is very pleased to see a whole range of British brands in Yerevan and stressed the importance of strengthening commercial ties between UK and Armenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Ministry of Foreign affairs Armenian Minister Edward Nalbandian and Mr. Lidington discussed ways of further deepen cooperation in political, scientific, educational, cultural and other spheres. Minister Nalbandian said, “This year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Armenia and the United Kingdom and we can state that the cooperation between the sides is on a sustainable basis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response the Minister said “United Kingdom considers Armenia as a long-term and valuable partner and his visit is aimed at the provision of a new impetus to the cooperation with Armenia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Nalbandyan presented the current stage of the negotiations over the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. He touched upon the damage to regional stability and security caused by the release of Ramil Safarov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Europe responded that the United Kingdom fully supports the OSCE Minsk Group processes. He mentioned that the UK shares the provisions in the statements of the European Union, Council of Europe and OSCE Minsk Group over the release of Ramil Safarov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his two day visit he met with leading businessmen to better understand the economic opportunities presented by Armenia for both trade and investment. He also discussed increasing awareness of the human rights situation in Armenia and exchanged views on regional and international issues with well-known Armenian analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the reception organised by the Armenian British Business Chamber the Minister stressed that he wants to look at how to build further economic and commercial relations between the UK and Armenia and that now the British Government is working on bringing out a business mission to Yerevan in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overseas Territories flags flown over Foreign Office</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From now on, the flag of each UK Overseas Territory will be flown over the FCO one day every year, to mark a significant day in each of their respective histories.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lidington said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I send my greetings and best wishes to all Gibraltarians on Gibraltar National Day. It is a day to celebrate the people of Gibraltar, their community and identity. It is fitting that Gibraltar’s flag should be flown annually in London to mark this occasion.”      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased that the FCO is celebrating this new era of positive engagement between the UK and the Territories by flying their flags over our building in London. The Government is determined to show our commitment to this relationship in a year which has seen a number of important landmarks, including the publication of the White Paper.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 June, the flag of the Falkland Islands was flown over the FCO, 10 Downing Street and the Department for Communities and Local Government to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the islands’ liberation. The flags of all Territories were flown as part of the Diamond Jubilee pageant and will be featured in future ceremonies of State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am disappointed to hear that Yuliya Tymoshenko’s final domestic appeal against her October 2011 conviction has been turned down by the Higher Specialized Court of Ukraine for Civil and Criminal Cases.  We have consistently drawn attention to independent expert concerns about the conduct of Ms Tymoshenko’s trial, and that of other opposition figures.  The UK will continue to press Ukraine to end selective justice and to ensure that the opposition is able to participate fully in free and fair parliamentary elections in October. Progress on Ukraine’s Association Agreement with the EU will remain difficult without clear evidence that Ukraine is embracing democracy and the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Report of the Human Rights Council on Syria</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest report of the Human Rights Council mandated Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations in Syria was published today.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, David Lidington, said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The evidence of human rights violations and abuses perpetrated by all parties, documented in the latest UN Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry report, is a chilling reminder of how far the situation in Syria has deteriorated over the last six months.  I am particularly disturbed by the reports of human rights violations and abuses committed against children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The report is clear that the gravity, frequency and scale of human rights violations perpetrated by the Syrian Government and its Shabbiha militia far exceeds abuses committed by anti-government armed groups.  The Syrian government has not simply failed in its responsibility to protect its citizens, but continues to repress them on a daily basis. The report lays the blame squarely at the regime’s door for the horrific massacre in Al-Houlah, confirming the earlier findings of UNSMIS and British-trained human rights activists.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The wide ranging information collected by the Commission of Inquiry, including details of individuals believed to be responsible for these crimes, will make a significant contribution towards efforts on accountability. I commend its work in gathering more than 1,000 witness statements since September 2011, as well as examining significant amounts of disturbing material such as photographs, videos and medical records.  As an independent body, its work is invaluable and we call for an extension of its mandate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
