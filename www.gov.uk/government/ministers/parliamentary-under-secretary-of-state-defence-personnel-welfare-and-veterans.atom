    <title>Lorraine Kelly launches Christmas Box appeal</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event launched the annual Christmas Box campaign for the Armed Forces, run by the charity &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk4u.org/" title="uk4u Thanks!"&gt;uk4u Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign sees 22,500 boxes - affectionately known as ‘square stockings’ - sent to servicemen and women across the world who are working away from their families and members of the Armed Forces recuperating in hospital this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorraine Kelly joined members of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/The-Royal-Marines" title="Royal Marines"&gt;Royal Marines&lt;/a&gt; Commando Recruiting Troop on the zip wire descending 80 feet (24 metres) from the top of Wellington Arch in Hyde Park down to the ground below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were greeted at the bottom by Father Christmas who gave everyone a 2012 Christmas Box painted in the colours of the Diamond Jubilee Medal ribbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be showing my support once again for such a worthwhile cause as the Christmas Box appeal, and I had a great time with the Royal Marines on the zip wire today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can join me in wishing a Happy Christmas to all our servicemen and women away from their families at this time of year by donating to the charity uk4u Thanks! who’ll send each of them a fantastic box full of goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also present were other members of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; and members of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/" title="British Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" title="Royal Air Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; who have received a Christmas Box while serving on operations on Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Soldiers with Christmas Boxes" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1327/boxes3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do not use the British Forces Post Office system so as not to delay parcels from families and friends getting through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Minister Mark Francois said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Christmas can be difficult for many of our servicemen and women who are deployed on operations away from their families when it matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can all therefore show that we are thinking of them by donating to charities such as uk4u Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Generous public urged: think twice before sending unsolicited Christmas gifts to troops</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just 100 days to go until Christmas Day, some generous members of the public may be considering sending presents to Armed Forces personnel serving abroad to help them celebrate the festive season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while everybody in the Forces is hugely grateful for the sentiment behind such gifts, the message is very clear: if people wish to show their support for those serving in austere conditions in Afghanistan, there are far more effective ways of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of mail arriving at Camp Bastion for onward distribution to other locations in Afghanistan causes three key problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;private mail sent to deployed personnel by their loved ones can become significantly delayed amongst all the other items from members of the public. Receipt of letters or gifts from a parent or spouse are very important for morale in theatre and for the peace of mind of families back home. The delays unsolicited mail inevitably cause to the delivery of the much more anticipated personal mail can create real disappointment and stress. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the onward delivery of goodwill parcels to forward operating bases necessitates additional resupply flights and convoys which places Service personnel at additional risk in what is already a difficult and dangerous operating environment. Every time an additional convoy is laid on, more troops are put at risk of enemy attack. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the type of items included in many welfare parcels are either already readily available in theatre or are simply not appropriate for the Afghan environment. Not only does this mean that the items go to waste, but time and resources have to be diverted from crucial operations to organise their disposal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the MOD is launching a campaign to remind members of the public that they can express their support in different ways - including by donating to a special fund that the Ministry of Defence has established to enable those who want to make a personal contribution to troops’ welfare support to do so in a co-ordinated way which does not cause these problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Staff at Lashkar Gah dealing with unsolicited mail" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1426/StaffdealingwithunsolicitedmailinLashkarGah.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Staff at Lashkar Gah dealing with unsolicited mail (library image)
[Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2009]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain James Talman, Controlling Postal Courier Officer on Operation HERRICK, based at Camp Bastion, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mail is really important to all our troops here. However, if people send out unsolicited parcels addressed to ‘any soldier’, or even to a named individual who is not known to them, they will simply clog up the system and delay the packages from friends and families which are so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While we all appreciate people’s support, I would ask members of the public not to send any unsolicited mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Ralph, responsible for Operational Welfare at the Ministry of Defence, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no denying that receiving a parcel can provide a morale-boost to serving personnel but what the troops on the ground really want is to receive their personal mail - the letters from loved ones and close friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the sheer number of welfare packages we have seen enter the system in the run-up to Christmas in previous years has caused serious delays to those all-important personal items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While we are all enormously grateful for the generosity of people who want to support the Armed Forces, packages from strangers can never make up for the delay they cause to mail from relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The message is clear: if you wish to show your support for the troops, the most effective way of doing so is to support an official registered Service charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways in which people in the UK can thank forces deployed overseas for their work and commitment. Helpful advice and a list of recommended Service charities which accept public donations to assist deployed personnel and their families back at home can be found on the Ministry of Defence website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these funds send welfare parcels to Afghanistan - but they do so, in consultation and partnership with the Armed Forces, in a co-ordinated way which does not put undue pressure on resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the MOD provides a comprehensive Deployed Welfare Package which includes a free mail service for families and friends, 30 minutes of telephone calls a week and internet access, there are still areas where life in an operational theatre can be improved over and above that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, and in order to enable members of the public to make a contribution to the welfare of personnel in an appropriate way, the MOD Operations Welfare Fund was established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priority for spending from the fund is set by commanders in theatre for those items which have the most impact in enhancing the morale of their personnel and any money donated to this fund enables commanding officers on the ground to bid for items which their men and women have asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of items purchased through the fund are Wii handsets, portable DVD players, games and table tennis tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone wishing to make a donation can send a cheque to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations Welfare Fund&lt;br&gt;
J1 Operation HERRICK&lt;br&gt;
PJHQ, Sandy Lane,&lt;br&gt;
Northwood, Middlesex,&lt;br&gt;
HA6 3HP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recommended charity is &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk4u.org/" title="uk4u Thanks!"&gt;uk4u Thanks!&lt;/a&gt; which already delivers a Christmas box of practical gifts and fun treats to every soldier, sailor and airman deployed overseas - in Afghanistan and elsewhere - and those in hospital and recovery centres in time for 25 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its parcels are delivered via the supply chain, meaning there is no impact on the mail network. Although the charity benefits from corporate sponsorship, it also needs donations from the public to continue its work bringing Christmas cheer to thousands of personnel. For more details visit their website at Related Links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Mark Francois, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Government is dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces, particularly those deployed on operations. This is reflected in the Deployed Welfare Package, a key part of which is the safe and timely delivery of free personal mail from family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past this mechanism has been used by the general public to show their support and resulted in huge volumes of unsolicited goodwill parcels being sent, which have overwhelmed the in-theatre postal and logistics capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst unsolicited mail is well-intentioned, mail sent by families and friends is the most important to deployed personnel and is our absolute priority. Moreover, unsolicited mail strains the logistics supply and prevents mail from families getting through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For this reason the MOD will be repeating its unsolicited mail campaign. Rather than sending their own letter or parcel, I would encourage people to make a donation to one of Britain’s excellent Service charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They might also consider ‘uk4u Thanks!’ - a charity that provides Christmas gifts to deployed Service personnel. Once again I would like to say thank you to the British public, on behalf of the MOD and Armed Forces, for their incredible support of our serving personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2011/12/01 - MoD Civilian Apprentice Awards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Bernard [Gray - Chief of Defence Materiel] for that introduction, and for inviting me to say a few words before presenting this year’s MoD civilian apprentice awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me also thank all of today’s sponsors for their continued support of this important event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly delighted that Lady Cardwell could be with us once again - after last year’s snow prevented her attendance for the first time since 1982 - to present the Sir David Cardwell Memorial Prize.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir David was one of Bernard’s predecessors - in charge of buying the equipment our Armed Forces need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the organisation has changed greatly since Sir David’s time in charge, some things endure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeships continue play an important role in helping us to produce the engineers and craftsmen of the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 500 apprenticeships and 300 advanced apprenticeships were completed last year; we’re here today to recognise the best of them - 29 in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the value of apprenticeships to our Armed Forces and our broader economic well-being is as high as ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, in the modern age, the work of the engineer and the craftsman is not as revered as it should be in the eyes of the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many students are lured away from inventing the future and making things people can actually use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet heavy industry generates more cash, more exports, more technology, and more jobs than many of the more fashionable sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want engineers and craftsmen to be the wonder of our age as they were in the Britain of Telford and Brunel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An architect may have designed London’s latest landmark - the Shard - but it takes engineers and craftsmen to build it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also takes excellence, and in a range of fields. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the practical engineering skills which Brunel would admire, today’s engineers need other skills like project management in their toolbox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our prize-winners today have shown they have the tools to meet the demands of modern engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why they have a great deal to offer to our Armed Forces and to our economy; and I want to reflect briefly on that this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this isn’t some abstract debate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men and women in our Armed Forces - particularly those on operations - rely on the quality of the equipment and support we can provide them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, soldiers in Afghanistan rely on their vehicles to carry out their mission as well as keep them safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything breaks down it can be a life-threatening situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes the job of today’s engineers and craftsmen a vital one, though they don’t always get the credit they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the engineers of the future are not born; they’re made, and they’re nurtured. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeships play such an important role in that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the MoD continues to value and support apprenticeships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our scheme remains an enviable one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a unique opportunity to work on some of the country’s most advanced engineering and equipment projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from our perspective, it’s a shrewd investment in our future workforce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the work on the new aircraft carriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an apprentice supporting the MoD project team, while others are embedded with industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this colossal project has reinvigorated industry apprenticeship schemes across the six shipyards engaged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 800 apprentices are currently involved, and this number is set to increase as production continues to ramp up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever they’re working, these apprentices are proud to learn their trade on such a prestigious project which will be at the heart of Britain’s defence for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we want everyone who undertakes an apprenticeship provided by us to stay with us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that some will go on to use their skills elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in good times, we should welcome the contribution they will make to the broader economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s particularly welcome in tough economic times like these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t defer investing in our future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a false economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing now in the skills we will need in the future is a key part of our plan for recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is as true for us in the public sector as it is for those in the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want a skills system where responsibility is shared between government, employers, and employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we want to address the problem of youth unemployment so that young people are earning or learning again before long-term damage is done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we launched a £1 billion Youth Contract last week which will provide over 400,000 new work places for 18 to 24 year olds over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeships are at the heart of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, we want to double the incentive payments to encourage employers to take on young apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good news for young people up and down the country, and good news for the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pay-off for business is a skilled, motivated, and loyal workforce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m proud to be the MoD’s apprentice champion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more engineers and craftsmen like you - you are becoming a rare breed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are vital to the Defence of this country, and central to its future prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m delighted that we can recognise your achievements with your friends and family today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/11/01 - Local Government Association Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Sir Merrick for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My congratulations on organising a fascinating day with some excellent speakers - they’re still to come..! -and workshops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a Councillor myself, and my wife is currently - within Westminster - so I have some understanding of the issues you face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fantastic to see so many representatives from across local government, and the voluntary and charitable sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are in the vanguard of our plans to cement the bond between our communities and the Armed Forces through the Armed Forces Covenant and Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone down the years would have embraced such localism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General de Gaulle once observed of France, “How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would have really struggled in Britain which - according to the gloriously named British Cheese Board - boasts over 700 distinct local cheeses! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he would have despaired at your job, Merrick, representing as you do hundreds of councils and thousands of councillors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, in part, De Gaulle’s complaint seems to have been that localism interferes with the smooth pursuit of the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps so in France, but in Britain I’ve always believed that’s the wrong way round. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Government believes in ‘small government’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course Westminster and Whitehall should lead on those issues which are truly national in scope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, at most, they should complement - not substitute - local efforts on everything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why decentralising power is at the heart of this government’s agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Britain’s Armed Forces straddle the national and local divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one level, they are rooted in lock communities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the British infantry system of county regiments helped to forge deep ties between those who serve - often alongside neighbours and friends - and the communities they left behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At another level, our Armed Forces are woven into the fabric of our nation’s history and psyche. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson on the quarterdeck; the Pals on the Somme; the SAS on TV as they stormed the Iranian Embassy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courage, sacrifice, excellence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why the British public have a deep respect for, and pride in, our Armed Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But respect and pride are not the same as understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Armed Forces Community may be an integral part of our society, but in recent decades the link has declined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When World War II ended in 1945, there were around five million men and women in uniform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone in the country knew someone close who had served. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents and her generation gave up their youth in the service of this country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Service generation only added to the ledger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for many years, our Armed Forces have been a professional, volunteer force - declining in number - while the older generations have dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public understanding of our Armed Forces has declined as a result.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters hugely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of our Armed Forces depends on them knowing that they have their country’s support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliament has taken to welcoming home units of the Armed Forces, and yesterday we welcomed 3 Commando. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked them to go to war, and it is right that we welcome them home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such support requires the public to understand the role of our Armed Forces, and the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make with their families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should never take public support for granted, even in times of plenty.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor should we under-estimate their principled conviction that our Armed Forces Community should get the support they need and the dignity they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That they should suffer no disadvantage as a result of serving; indeed should receive special consideration in some instances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that they have a right to expect a whole of society approach - not just a top-down, or bottom-up one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m pleased to say that in the 18 months since the General Election we’ve taken action over a very broad canvas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, the principles I have mentioned (no disadvantage) will be recognised in the law of the land through the Armed Forces Bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the front line, we’ve doubled the operational allowance and extended it to Libya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve improved the Rest and Recuperation leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve doubled Council Tax relief from 25% to 50% for all personnel on operations, including Libya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, we set out - in the ‘Today and Tomorrow’ paper - what we’re doing to give the Covenant practical effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, we have endorsed all of Andrew Murrison’s recommendations for improving mental health care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have allocated resources for 36,000 Service children as part of the pupil premium, and introduced a separate fund for schools with high proportions of Service children.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are giving our personnel a high priority in Affordable Housing Schemes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as I’ve said, the Armed Forces Covenant is not just about action from the centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are fewer than 200,000 serving members of our Armed Forces, whereas there are still more than four and a half million people who have served. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their families, our Armed Forces Community is roughly one in six of the total population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing support to this vast number of people involves all areas of local government working with communities up and down the land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10 NHS Armed Forces Networks have proved particularly useful in ironing out local healthcare and adult social care issues through their extensive local networks.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an RAF couple were devastated to hear that their application to adopt a child had been scuppered by orders posting them overseas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Local Authority had withdrawn from the process as ‘suitable’ counselling services would not be available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contacting their regional Armed Forces Network lead, they were able to get SSAFA Forces Help to liaise with the Local Authority until the issue was resolved and the adoption went ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ‘no disadvantage from service’ principle in action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also shows the importance of local authorities forging links with Service charities and the wider voluntary and charitable sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in June, four counties became the first in Britain to demonstrate community-led support for the Armed Forces through the Community Covenant scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear more about best practice later this morning from three of the counties involved so far - Oxfordshire, Hampshire, and North Yorkshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further seven councils have signed, with over 30 in the pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Community Covenant has been well-received, and my hope is that every community will sign one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important as a symbol of our beliefs, and it’s important as a commitment to action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon you will hear more about the Community Covenant Grant Scheme.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have allocated up to £30 million until 2015 to fund projects which support the aims of the Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A panel considered the first bids last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to announce that we have approved 11 superb bids in full, and another two in part, totalling over £400,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly pleased to see that those bids will draw in matched funding of over a quarter of a million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the successful bids themselves, they include help towards a new Scout and Guides Headquarters in Bedale; supporting the Dover Diamond Jubilee Tattoo; and helping elderly residents in their village during adverse weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions on another 14 applications will be made once we have received some additional information.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they are all approved, it would take total project funding past £1 million in just this first round. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panels are due to sit again in December and March, and quarterly thereafter - so it’s not too late! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, Defence is a very human endeavour -  and the consequences of Service life are very human too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that today inspires you to deepen the relationship between our Armed Forces and the communities they’re drawn from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that relationship is as important now as it’s ever been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we, as a nation, treat our Armed Forces Community is a litmus test of who we are as a nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m confident that the nation will respond to the challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that it will be driven in part by localism in the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/10/27 - The Confederation of Service Charities (COBSEO) AGM</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Tony [Air Vice-Marshal Tony Stables, Royal Air Force (ret’d), Chairman, COBSEO] for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[As Tony said], it is indeed a privilege to meet here in St. James’s Palace, and we are honoured that the Prince of Wales will be joining us shortly in his new capacity as COBSEO Patron. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that Simon Burns from the Department of Health spoke at last year’s event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ll speak on behalf of the MoD.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, perhaps a Minister from another government department - maybe even a Lib Dem?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shrewd move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sends a clear message that the contract between the nation and the Armed Forces Community goes beyond one Department or one sector of society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COBSEO is at the heart of that contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You represent the best of what the French philosopher, Tocqueville, called “the art of association”, which gives society a “habit and taste for serving others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult for Government to engage in a meaningful way with each of the 180 or so organisations - including some 66 regimental associations - which come under the COBSEO umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of COBSEO, we are able to develop a far greater degree of coherence across government in our approach to all these organisations and the important work they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And COBSEO makes their voice in Government far more powerful as a result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are also a helpful voice of conciliation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our overriding objective is the same: to dignify, honour, and support our Armed Forces Community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet sometimes the priorities of one organisation do not always mesh with those of another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they overlap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has no role in telling your members what to do; individual organisations, not government, know what’s best for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the Chairman of SSAFA Forces Help, Sir Kevin O’Donoghue has said, “As time goes by, it is natural and right that some organisations merge with others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Poppyscotland and the Royal British Legion have recently merged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t changed the brand of Poppyscotland; the Scottish poppy and Scottish Poppy Appeal remain firmly in place; and the manufacture of poppies continues - as it has for almost 90 years - at Lady Haig’s Poppy Factory in Edinburgh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it has provided is major additional investment, which will mean better services for ex-Service personnel and their families north of the border. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SSAFA Forces Help have taken on the charitable objectives and assets of The Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation which supported Britain’s forces and their families for 156 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples like these underscore Sir Kevin’s view, and I know that COBSEO has lent a deft touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that (where appropriate) the voluntary and charitable sector should consolidate, not diverge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t have to mean mergers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, the way forward will lie in better co-operation and collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what matters most is the service and the best way of providing it, not the structures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen that with the Defence Recovery Capability which has taken the way we support our wounded, injured, and sick personnel to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In large part, this is thanks to Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion pooling their resources with the MoD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this partnership represents the single largest charitable contribution to the Armed Forces in British history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Government has a major role to play too, and I’ll come to that in a minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I’ve said before, action from the top, or just from the bottom, is rarely the panacea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glass will only be half-full unless Government, local authorities, the Devolved Administrations, charities, businesses, communities, and individuals come together and maximise the benefit their services can offer the Armed Forces Community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a whole of society approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate that with some specific issues which I know are close to COBSEO’s heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take transition issues.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Service leavers are said to be a particularly vulnerable group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as finding a new job, they may often have welfare, housing, education, healthcare, and psychological needs which have to be addressed simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many organisations out there willing and able to help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently visited one of the smaller COBSEO members - the recently renamed Stoll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The housing and support they provide for vulnerable and disabled ex-Service personnel - particularly the homeless - is quite simply the Big Society in action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support and advice is provided by the voluntary and charitable sector across the UK so that those who choose to serve their country can look to their country with confidence when they most need help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it can nonetheless be daunting for those who need help to know where to turn, and we’re addressing this issue through the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency hotline and website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But COBSEO has also helped enormously as people can now look at their website and their inaugural ‘handbook’ to find out who does what. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COBSEO is also running a transition system for early Service leavers to trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’ve set up a number of cluster groups within COBSEO to look at specific issues such as residential and care homes; criminal justice support; and welfare delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, through the “Forces in Mind” trust, COBSEO is leading a partnership of Service charities and mental health organisations seeking Big Lottery funding to support the psychological well-being and successful transition of Service leavers and their families into civilian life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll know if they’ve been successful shortly, and I wish them every success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I would come back to the Government’s role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some areas where the MoD is firmly in the lead within government - the operational allowance to the Veterans’ helpline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my colleagues across Whitehall recognise the role they have too.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has developed a Transition Protocol with the Department of Health, Devolved Administrations, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition for the most seriously ill and injured Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Prime Minister announced investment in the NHS of up to £15 million to improve the prosthetics services for ex-Service personnel who have lost a limb due to activities while serving their country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also much more going on as part of our wider work on the Armed Forces Covenant and Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, for example, we shall be announcing the first tranche of grant funding for projects which support the aims of the Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other areas, we work together, taking the lead or complementing the efforts of your members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must work together, but we must also talk to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value the input of the independent members of the Covenant Reference Group, of which COBSEO is a member along with TRBL, SSAFA Forces Help, the War Widows Association, the three Family Federations, and Professor Hew Strachan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a particularly important contribution as we prepare the new Annual Report on the Covenant, as required by the Armed Forces Bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, we all know that times are tough.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet such is the respect in which our Armed Forces are held that the public continues to support so many service charities to re-pay the debt of honour we all owe those who serve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that COBSEO will be in the vanguard of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/09/19 - Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation AGM</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Sir John [Field Marshal Sir John Chapple, President, Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation] for that introduction, and for inviting me to join your AGM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The housing and support which the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation provides for vulnerable and disabled veterans - particularly the homeless - is quite simply the Big Society in action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s replicated across the charitable and voluntary sector so that those who choose to serve their country can look to their country with confidence when they most need help.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer breadth and depth of this effort never ceases to amaze me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent example is Pryors Bank Cafe, here in Fulham, which, as you know, is a not-for-profit business run in partnership with the Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was founded by a former soldier, which to my mind gave it a fighting chance from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It trains former Service personnel to NVQ standard with the chance of working in West End Restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it pays people a wage, gives them a chance to study at college, and assists them in finding accommodation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when your Chief Executive invited me to see for myself the terrific work the Foundation does, I was only too happy to oblige. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good opportunity for me to set your work in the broader context of Government policy towards serving and former Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are testing times for the country - and Defence is no exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Government seeks to put the public finances back on a sustainable path, we in Defence are doing the same for a Defence budget which has been in disarray for some time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also seeking to transform our Armed Forces so that they are fit for the 21st century and the demands which living in this century will place on our Servicemen and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no denying that there are serious issues to address, and the context in which we will operate will be tough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has had to make some difficult, painful, but necessary decisions to get the Defence budget broadly back towards balance, and further tough decisions lie ahead of us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had to prioritise ruthlessly in order to ensure that any extra money we can spend, we do so wisely, and on those things that are most urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s at times like these that having some guiding principles stands us in good stead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those serving today, we are clear that our priorities are caring for those who are physically and mentally injured in the course of their service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for those who have ever put country before self we are determined that the country as a whole should unite in its determination to provide the very best support possible in return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we have published the first ever Tri-Service Armed Forces Covenant in which these key principles will be recognised, among others, for the first time, in the law of land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the ‘Today and Tomorrow’ paper, we have set out what we’re doing to give the Covenant practical effect, for example in the areas of Healthcare, Education, and Housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Government has a major role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervention by the charitable and voluntary sector has a long tradition of making an impact - this Foundation alone has been operating since 1917. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But action just from the top, or just from the bottom, is rarely the panacea.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glass will only be half-full unless Government, local authorities, Devolved Administrations, charities, businesses, communities, and individuals come together and maximise the benefit their services can offer the Defence Community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a whole of society approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, with the Army Recovery Capability, we’ve seen the way we support our wounded, injured, and sick personnel taken to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In large part, that’s thanks to the MoD, Help for Heroes, and the Royal British Legion pooling their resources in a common aim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the MoD has developed a Transition Protocol with the Department of Health, Devolved Administrations, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition for the most seriously ill and injured Service personnel.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new Big White Wall on-line support network to support the mental health needs of the Armed Forces community is another example excellent example of a whole of society approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is clearly still more to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing the homeless is the subject most dear to your hearts, so let me say a few words about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Prime Minister has said, “It is an affront to this country that last winter, one of the coldest on record, there were people still sleeping rough on our streets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, some of those on the streets in that bitter winter cold were former Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may have been affected by their experiences of active service; others by what happened to them before or since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other Departments have the lead role, we in the MoD have an ongoing duty of care to those who serve our nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are leaving no stone unturned to see if there are preventative measures we can take in-Service to minimise the impact on our people when they leave.  I mentioned the Transition Protocol just now, but there are other initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we intend to consult on how the Armed Forces are managed on social housing lists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And current and former members of the Armed Forces will be put at the front of the queue for the new FirstBuy scheme, and other Government initiatives to support first time buyers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Service in our Armed Forces is not a pre-requisite for homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the Ministerial level, we’re taking a broad approach to homelessness through the inter-Ministerial Working Group on homeless issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, we published a cross-Government report called, ‘Vision To End Rough Sleeping: No Second Night Out Nationwide’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to tackle the complex causes of homelessness - not only housing, but family breakdown and mental health; drug addiction and alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s about partnership at all levels with the ultimate aim of helping the homeless along the path to full independent living. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Government can only do so much; the whole of society must play its part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s here that the excellent work of the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation really comes into its own, and you should be proud of the high-regard in which you are held by the ex-Service community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures show a reduction in rough sleeping by ex-Service personnel in London, and your hard work has undoubtedly played a major part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish you the best with your Veterans Nomination Scheme which dovetails neatly with the Covenant and the Big Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also pay tribute to other initiatives such as ‘The Beacon’ near Catterick Garrison which offers 31 flats to homeless veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, these projects would not have been possible without effective partnership at all levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So despite the tough times we are going through, there are reasons to be cheerful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Brigadier Ricketts of Veterans Aid said recently, “I’m still firmly of the opinion that if you are in crisis in Britain today, you are lucky if you are a veteran. There is a huge military family that will reach out to you in your hour of need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s more than that: there is a grateful society at large to turn to as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the forefront of that effort - as it has been for almost a century - is the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are further proof that compassion for those who serve on our behalf remains at the heart of who we are as a nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/09/01 - MOD Welfare conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add my thanks to all of you who have come and all the organisations represented here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In difficult times it is especially important than we come together to discuss policy, to swap ideas, to share concerns, to suggest solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because this is a testing time for the country - and for Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="testing-times"&gt;Testing Times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A time of austerity - as the Government seeks to put the public finances back on a sustainable path - and seeks to do the same for a Defence budget that has been in disarray for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a time of change - as we seek to transform our Armed Forces for the rigours of modern warfare - and for the rigours of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times like this the men and women of our Armed Forces need people like you - not only to support them, but to speak up for them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I know that this conference is not going to be all sweetness and light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are serious issues to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the next few years the context in which we will operate will be tough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has had to make some difficult, very painful but necessary decisions to get the Defence budget broadly back towards balance and further tough decisions lie ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has meant that we have had to prioritise ruthlessly in order to ensure that any extra money we can spend, we do so wisely and on those things that are most urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="operational-welfare"&gt;Operational Welfare&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations have to come first - making sure that those in the firing line have the tools and protection they need to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has not been just about strategy and equipment, but about making sure they and their families are looked after too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Montgomery set out in his principles of warfare - ‘the morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why on the welfare side we doubled the Operational Allowance and extended it to Libya, and improved Rest and Recuperation leave and increased compensation for those who suffer both physical and mental injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we have doubled Council Tax relief from 25% to 50%, for all personnel on operations, including in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus of operations has meant that in other areas we haven’t been able to go as far and as fast as we want - for instance on the speed with which we improve housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although 96% of Service Family Accommodation properties are now in the top two standards for condition, and we will continue to target efforts on the most pressing accommodation issues, there will be a three-year pause in the programme to upgrade lower quality SFA homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="action"&gt;Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hope you will agree with me that we have been as consultative as possible and where we have been able to act we have done so in the right areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, we have endorsed all of Andrew Murrison’s proposals for improving mental health care. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A structured mental health component within existing medical examinations performed whilst serving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An uplift in the number of mental health professionals conducting veterans’ outreach work from Mental Health Trusts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trial of an online early intervention service for serving personnel and veterans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The means to allow the newly formed Veterans’ Information Service (VIS) to contact Service leavers after they have left the Armed Forces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, for those who need it at the time of discharge, a specialist opinion and any follow on treatment by the MOD’s Mental Health Service for a period of six months’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have laid the foundations for a new understanding between Armed Forces personnel and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the Service Personnel Command Paper, we have published the first ever tri-service Armed Forces Covenant in which the key principles will be recognised, for the first time, in the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the ‘Today and Tomorrow’ paper we have set out what we’re doing to give the Covenant practical effect, for example in the areas of Healthcare, Education and Housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn’t just about action from the centre or from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be hearing from the Armed Forces Networks later today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These have proved particularly useful in ironing out local level issues between the MOD and the local NHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in June four counties - Oxfordshire, Hampshire, North Yorkshire, and Vale of Glamorgan - became the first in Britain to demonstrate community-led support for the Armed Forces through the Community Covenant scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Oxfordshire alone, more than £100,000 of Council money will be spent in the next 12 months to help people leaving the forces to resettle in the county, topped up with grants from Government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities, Devolved Administrations, charities, businesses, communities, and individuals have come together by offering their services to help the Defence Community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is still a place for central support, for instance, extra Government money for schools which educate pupils from forces’ families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole of society approach has been central to what - together - we have been able to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Army Recovery Capability - a joint venture between the MoD, Help for Heroes, and the Royal British Legion - is taking the way we support our wounded, injured, and sick personnel to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve the transition from Service to civilian life, the MoD has developed a Transition Protocol with the Department of Health, Devolved Administrations, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition for the most seriously ill and injured Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new, round-the-clock, veterans’ mental health helpline is funded by the NHS and run by Rethink Mental Health on behalf of Combat Stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="challenges"&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, we are determined to be bold and ambitious, and to build formidable, well-managed Armed Forces structured for the rigours of future conflict, supported by an affordable defence programme, and sensitive to the needs of the people who serve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who serve today, and their families, have very different expectations and needs from those of even a generation ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces need to offer a comprehensive package of pay, benefits, education, training, medical support, career progression, and job satisfaction - among other things - to recruit and retain personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they also need to ensure that life in the Forces meets the needs of modern families too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what lies behind our thinking on the New Employment Model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that a large number of Service Personnel and there families would benefit from a more stable lifestyle - everything from schooling the children to buying a home to providing better stability for spouse’s careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear that the Defence budget would benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would enable us to reduce housing stock and relocation costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also allow us to minimise spending on expensive allowances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while stability and predictability will please families, they are hardly the best slogans to put on adverts designed to attract the people we need in tomorrow’s Armed Forces. Many people will still be required to move on a regular basis and support for this must remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balance may be difficult to achieve, and reaching it will present different challenges for each of the 3 Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no panacea, and more work remains to be done - and this is an area in which we need input from you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that we offer flexibility and choice so that a life in the Armed Forces appeals to a broad range of the society from which our people are drawn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, we have much to discuss and much work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that times are tough and we need to be realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may not always agree on what we prioritise, but I know that we all share a passion: to do our very best to support the men and women of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/05/25 - British Medical Association (BMA) Armed Forces Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Brendan [Dr. Brendan McKeating, Chairman, BMA Armed Forces Committee] for that kind introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Secretary of State was questioned about the potential for abuse of the Covenant by scurrilous members of the legal profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that he had one sister who is a doctor and one who is a lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His father used to say he had the best of both worlds: one licensed to kill; one licensed to steal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Liam Fox is himself a Doctor and of course a politician.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has therefore the licence not only to kill but to explain why it was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the Defence Medical Services is a hugely important part of my Ministerial brief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made it a priority to meet as many Regular and Reserve DMS members as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my visits to Afghanistan, I have visited Camp Bastion’s Role 3 medical facility - last time, commanded by Colonel Robin Jackson TA, and now by a RN Commander Carole Betteridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may well know, on the office wall at Bastion is a map of Task Force Helmand (South West) with the facility in the middle surrounded by concentric circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each circle shows the distance a Medical Emergency Response Team can cover in a set time to reach a casualty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first boundary is ten minutes - five minutes out, and five back again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And every minute matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you know personally, the Bastion team are doing quite remarkable work in difficult circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I am always very impressed at the sheer breadth of service which DMS members provide - from emergency life-saving procedures on operations to primary care at home and overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also pay tribute to the civilian medical staff who support the Services and their families around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s right to take stock at this conference - of achievements and future challenges.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the MoD Ministerial team I would like to pay tribute to everyone involved - regular, reserve, civilian - for the magnificent job they, you are doing; thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of the next 12 months are likely to be no less testing than the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan remains our number one priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have the challenge of operations elsewhere - not least Libya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I saw on Saturday an RAF doctor working in Italy with the Typhoon/Tornado deployment on ops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we face a major programme of change following the Strategic Defence and Security Review which will transform Defence for 2020 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDSR sets the vision for the Armed Forces we require. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the SDSR will take some time and there are a series of complicated second order consequences including the basing and reserves reviews, as well as the emerging work from the Defence Reform Unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise the uncertainty this places on you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have jobs that are tough, often dangerous, and always vital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to keep you updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to talk about four things which I know are of personal interest to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the vexed issue of pay and allowances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us are tightening our belts, and I won’t pretend it’s pain free, including for the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current financial climate we cannot do as much to honour that obligation, or do it as quickly, as we would like, but where we can act we will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we have doubled the operational allowance - over £5000 tax free for a 6 month deployment; changed the Rest and Recuperation arrangements on operations; and maintained the annual increments for eligible military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Armed Forces Pay Review Body will continue to review recruitment and retention levels of specific professions within the DMS, and where necessary introduce measures to improve conditions or recruitment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligation we owe to our service men and women, set against the commitment and sacrifice that they make, is enormous.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  Armed Forces Covenant  launched last week recognises  that service personnel should face no disadvantage compared to other citizens in the provision of services and therefore require, in some circumstances, special consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much still to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been clear that the covenant is an evolving issue, not something completed overnight, and I believe that the British people understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to be a whole of Government effort, linked to what you are doing, what the NHS is doing, and what local government and the charitable sector is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of that is the work the MOD is doing with the Health Department and charities to support Andrew Murrison’s review into the effectiveness of NHS prosthetic services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing I want to talk about is the future shape of the DMS.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admiral Jarvis will say more about this later, but as most of you know we have launched a comprehensive internal review - DMS 20 - to help shape the DMS for the next decade and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordability will be a factor because everything we do has to be anchored in the art of the possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But DMS 20 is primarily about the medical capabilities required to support Defence, and how best these can be delivered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other significant workstrand for the DMS is the independent Future Reserves 20 study - commissioned by the Prime Minister - which is planning to publish its report later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a limit to what I can say without pre-empting its work, but I will say this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continued deployment of significant numbers of DMS Reserves underlines their value to and integration with overall Defence capability.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserves remain integral to the future of Britain’s Defence as part of the “Whole Force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, mental health - a subject around which I tread very warily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of their service, the men and women of our Armed Forces see things and experience things that push them to the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will have physical injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will have mental scars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will have both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, good training, understanding leadership, the support of family and the comradeship of those who have been through the same thing can help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But psychological difficulties can be hard to diagnose, and, as you will know better than I, sometimes taking years to surface, often after people have left the forces.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we made tackling mental health issues such a high priority, and why we are putting extra funding aside for better healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why we welcomed Andrew Murrison’s independent study of mental health services for both current and former Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already put two of his recommendations into practice: a free, dedicated 24 hour support line for former and serving personnel and their families - and I have phoned it and can confirm that it works; and 30 additional mental health nurses for former personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, there will be an enhanced mental health assessment for serving personnel during medical examinations -in-Service and prior to discharge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where our personnel do suffer mental health illness they must receive of course proper compensation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’ve nearly trebled the maximum compensation payment for those suffering the most severe mental health problems under the AFCS, and increased the amounts that they are paid for life on leaving the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simply the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, what of the future? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocrates is quoted as saying that ‘war is the only proper school for a surgeon’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the physical and mental toll of war has driven medical practice and innovation forward and refocused research into specific conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work benefits not just those on the front line or in the Armed Forces generally, but civilian patients too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the foundation of the Red Cross in the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino in 1859. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the pioneering work to develop penicillin in the Second World War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast became the world leader in treatment of gun shot wounds during the Troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the principles behind the new National Institute of Health Research for Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, the opening of which I attended earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 20,000 people in Britain suffer major trauma each year, and issues like haemorrhage control; resuscitation; and wound management remain challenges for society at large.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIHR will help us continue to develop new techniques to treat our forces fighting in Afghanistan, and allow military surgeons to share rapid advances and surgical innovation in managing severe trauma with the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s collaboration in action for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that puts your Conference in context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military service is never without risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a moral duty to ensure those who suffer in the service of our country are properly cared for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why making sure our people get the right medical support is such a vital component of the Armed Forces Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much to be resolved, but our intent is clear and with your help we will achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/02/11 - Army Recovery Capability</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Tom [Colonel Fleetwood, Commander Colchester Garrison] for those kind words of welcome, and for hosting me here today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one year to the day since the launch of the Army Recovery Capability initiative - the ARC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This joint venture - between the MoD, Help for Heroes, and the Royal British Legion - will take the way we treat our wounded, injured and sick personnel to a new level.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve months on, and we have made real progress, which is why I am delighted to be able to ‘cut the turf’ at the first purpose-built Personnel Recovery Centre here at Colchester. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to see that so many of you from the local community could come and see this progress for yourselves, and learn about our future plans for the ARC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your chance to speak to some of the Service personnel who have benefitted from the enhancements and facilities that the ARC has to offer, and the personnel employed to support them; I encourage you to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also delighted to be sharing the platform with the Adjutant General, General Mans, who is making sure that the Army delivers its part of the bargain to make the ARC a success.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will explain why the ARC is so important and how it works in a little more detail shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s right and proper that Bryn Parry from Help for Heroes and Chris Simpkins from the Royal British Legion are here today too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s event would not have been possible without them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dedication and financial generosity of both charities, combined with the long-term commitment they have made to this initiative, is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is RBL’s biggest single financial commitment in nearly 90 years, and Help for Heroes - which was only launched in 2007 - have also generated huge support and funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are extremely grateful for all that they do, and it’s part of our broader commitment to a long-term partnership with the Service charities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said at the outset that the Army Recovery Capability takes the way we treat our wounded, injured and sick personnel to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ARC ensures that that those who need it receive the right level of welfare support and access to key services to allow a successful return to duty; or to make the smoothest transition to an appropriately skilled and supported life outside the Service.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the contribution of our charitable partners, but it is also a multi-million pound commitment by the Ministry of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has committed £35M over four years to ensure the success of this project, and we will be providing the personnel needed to staff the Personnel Recovery Centres - like the one to be built here in Colchester. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience shows that injured personnel find a military environment conducive to the best possible recovery, and the strength of Colchester’s connection with our Armed Forces - historically and today - made it a logical choice to be one of the four centres. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the centres, a key component of the ARC is the Royal British Legion Battle Back Centre.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle Back is a Tri-Service initiative which aims to improve and formalise the use of adventurous training and adaptive sport in the aftercare of wounded, injured and sick Service personnel in order to aid their rehabilitation and return to an active life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already know how much this type of activity can benefit an individual’s recovery, both physically and psychologically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the focus is on what an individual can do, not what they can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBL will establish a Battle Back Centre by the summer which will integrate all Battle Back activity on behalf of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be available to all personnel undergoing recovery from all three services, including mobilised reservists.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as important as the ARC is, it’s just one essential part of the support available to wounded, injured and sick personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our involvement in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted in an increasing number of wounded personnel, some of whom are suffering devastating injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the incredible professionalism and capabilities of the medical support - both in theatre and here at home - our personnel are now surviving those devastating injuries that once would have been life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical care and rehabilitation facilities that are available to our Service personnel are second to none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will ensure that this remains the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way in which we are achieving this is by implementing a Transition Protocol between the MoD, the Department of Health, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition from military to civilian life for wounded, injured, and sick Service personnel with ongoing health and/or social needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This protocol was agreed by all stakeholders in September 2010, and is currently being trialled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trial period ends in March, and will then become Tri-Service policy, and firm policy for the other Departments involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, help from charities like RBL and Help for Heroes extends beyond funding the Recovery Centres. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Help for Heroes also provide funding in direct support of Individual Recovery Plans, which are tailored to meet the needs of recovering personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure we’ll here more from Bryn about that shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all these initiatives - the ARC; first-class medical and clinical care; the implementation of the Transition Protocol - are part of our commitment to an Armed Forces Covenant, which will soon set out the moral obligation that this nation has to those who volunteer to defend it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, we owe it to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces to make sure they are fit for life - both physically and mentally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the difficult financial position we find ourselves in, that is what this Government is doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ARC embodies that effort, and today we mark a major milestone in our progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful for the hard work and dedication of all those involved, and I know you will make the ARC a huge success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I’ll hand over to General Mans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2010/12/06 - Armed Forces 2020: Reserves in Transformation Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Michael [Professor Clark, Director, RUSI] for that introduction, and for asking me to open today’s conference on the future of our Reserve forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of June, I gave two speeches to RUSI in the space of the week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long ago that seems: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg adorned every student’s wall;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This on the record so sorry boss: David Cameron was popular with Harrier pilots;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Ed Miliband was looking forward to Christmas with his brother…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things stay the same, however - always a pleasure to be here at RUSI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Royal Highness, Your Grace, Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we published the Strategic Defence and Security Review just over a month ago, the Prime Minister commissioned a six-month review of the Reserve Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re calling it the Future Reserves Study 2020, or FR20 for short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is chaired by the Vice Chief, General Sir Nick Houghton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And supported by my friend and colleague, Julian Brazier, MP, who is the Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Reserves and Cadets, and was a TA officer for 13 years; and by Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb - a distinguished career soldier, with whom I was a Troop Commander nearly 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am delighted that subject matter experts drawn from across the Defence community have also agreed to support the Study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could not be in better hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there’s a limit to what I can say about FR20 without pre-empting its work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to set the scene for today’s conference by explaining the SDSR context in which FR20 will operate; and the principles that will guide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few months have been unsettling for all of us in Defence, because we knew that change would come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first fundamental re-think in 12 years had to acknowledge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that we are in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in a generation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that we inherited a national debt that was growing at a rate that could fund three Type 45 destroyers per week &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that we also inherited some restrictive but binding, contractual arrangements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that security and defence are indivisible these days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and that we needed to increase investment in certain priority areas such as cyber security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, we had to reach our conclusions while our Armed Forces are fighting hard in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the fact that the Defence budget is making a more modest contribution to deficit reduction than many other government departments shows the priority across Government that we attach to national security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDSR protects our mission in Afghanistan and provides a template for our future Defence posture and capabilities, but there is still a great deal of work to be done before the detailed picture of what we call our Future Force 2020 emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes this fundamental review of the Reserve Forces’ role and structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I spoke here in June, I summed up our approach to the SDSR in three words: relevance, realism, and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also apply these principles in FR20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - Relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Review of Reserves 2009, led by Major General Nicholas Cottam, focused largely on improvement to existing roles and structures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a valuable piece of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the SDSR was clear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our posture and capabilities must be relevant to the challenges we will face in 2020 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FR20 will build on the proud history and traditions of the Reserves, and the vast operational experience many of them have gained in Iraq and Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its overriding task is to ensure that the Reserves fulfil a meaningful operational role within our Future Force 2020, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, FR20 will explore the role of the Reserves as part of the Whole Force Concept - looking not just at the Regular/Reservist balance, but full gamut of non-Regular manpower, including the roles of contractors and civilians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second principle is Realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordability will always be a constant pressure on Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this Study must be anchored in the art of the possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, we must challenge the view that Reserves are somehow seen as ‘Defence on the Cheap’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are part of the inherent structure of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And employers who release Reservists for duty get an excellent return on their investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estate issues will also be a key area of FR20, because as you will know, the volunteer estate was already lagging behind structural changes since the last Defence Review in 1998, and needs to be realigned with Future Force 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no decisions have been taken about precisely how the volunteer estate will change, it is likely that the total number of sites will reduce, but will be more suitable for the 21st century tasks required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure that remains must enable, not constrain, the organisation it is supporting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third principle is responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serving in the Reserves must remain attractive, relevant, and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we must ensure that they are looked after properly during and after service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have another responsibility: to tell the public about the magnificent contribution our Reservists are making - month in, month out; year in, year out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, when Only Fools and Horses was the most popular TV show, the nation instinctively laughed when Marlene told Del Boy that she wasn’t pregnant because: “Boycie fires more blanks than a Territorial!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laughed because Reserves were seen as the modern day equivalent of Dad’s Army: admirable in many ways, but perhaps taken more seriously by themselves than the British public or their Regular counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, time after time our Reserves have come to Britain’s aid - supporting the Regulars.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military chiefs know that Reservists contribute a huge range of skills and capability to the Whole Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They know how dependent operations in Afghanistan are on Reservists - particularly the specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to the Regulars’ credit, the Reservists I’ve spoken to say how well they’ve been looked after and integrated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear - the Reserves remain integral to the future of Britain’s Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, we will seek ideas from across the Services - Regulars and Reservists - and from close friends and allies, think tanks, and international organisations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will consult through direct engagement, seminars, presentations, and focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look at international models, noting the cultural context, and draw any appropriate lessons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will never forget the important place that our Reserves have in society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, I have long admired Dr. Johnson’s observation that “Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea” - and I of course extend that to airmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s often forgotten that, in both World Wars, it was the Reserves who filled the gap and saved the day after the Regulars were hit hard in early battles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re on the frontline again, in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not the ‘weekend warriors’ of popular myth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a special kind of person to volunteer to serve in the Reserves - balancing the demands of 21st century civilian life with the demands of 21st century warfare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They bring incredible skills, experience, and capabilities to the Defence of the Realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they do so willingly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must maximise their talents in a structure that serves the nation as well as our Reservists have always done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s event is a chance to be bold and innovative, to challenge assumptions, and to think at a strategic level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing your views - now and in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
