    <title>Typhoon for Oman</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>BAE Systems has signed a contract with the Sultanate of Oman for the supply of 12 Typhoon aircraft, associated support and 8 Hawk 128 aircraft. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.baesystems.com/home" title="BAE Systems website"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; released a statement confirming that the deal is worth some £2.5 billion and equips the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.omanet.om/english/government/defence.asp?cat=gov" title="Oman Defence web pages"&gt;Sultan’s Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; with the most sophisticated aircraft on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the deal the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This represents a further chapter in the historical and deep relationship between Oman and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oman’s choice of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhooneurofighter.cfm" title="Typhoon aircraft"&gt;Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; recognises the capabilities of this versatile aircraft and its long term potential to stay at the forefront of military capability for many years. Oman will be a valued member of the growing Typhoon family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This sale is an important contribution to our race for growth providing significant revenue and protecting high value jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="RAF Typhoon aircraft in flight (stock image) [Picture: Senior Aircraftman Ash Reynolds, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5809/LEU-Unclass-20120912-0850-181.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;1(F) Squadron and 6 Squadron, based at RAF Leuchars, fly Typhoon aircraft over RAF Leuchars station and St Andrews town (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The relationship between the Sultan’s Armed Forces and those of the United Kingdom is enduring. This purchase of Typhoon will serve to strengthen further the bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As with the existing Jaguar and Hawk aircraft I am confident that Typhoon will provide many years of first class service to the Royal Air Force of Oman and maintain its long and fruitful relationship with the Royal Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Secretary Vince Cable welcomed the deal and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is obviously a very good day for BAE Systems, its suppliers and the broader Eurofighter supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MOD launches new Skynet satellite</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A new satellite which will provide secure military communications for UK Armed Forces has been successfully launched into space.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra lines of communication will benefit personnel deployed in Afghanistan and other parts of the world, including the Falklands, Cyprus and on ships at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; pictures show the moment that Skynet 5D was launched from French Guiana, South America. It is the fourth satellite of the Skynet 5 project to be put into space since 2007 under a £4bn Private Finance Initiative (&lt;abbr title="Private Finance Initiative"&gt;PFI&lt;/abbr&gt;) programme with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.astrium.eads.net/" title="Astrium website"&gt;Astrium&lt;/a&gt;, who built the satellite and service providers &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.astriumservices.com/" title="Astrium Services"&gt;Astrium Services&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skynet project sustains approximately 800 jobs between the company’s sites in Stevenage, Portsmouth and Corsham, Wiltshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in space, Skynet 5D will travel at speeds of around 10,000 kilometres per hour and is expected to cover around 1.2 billion kilometres during its time in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Skynet programme provides vital support to the Armed Forces. The launch of this latest satellite will deliver additional global communications capacity to support our operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/philip-hammond" title="Read about Defence Secretary Philip Hammond"&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The launch of Skynet 5D marks another milestone in this very successful programme. These satellites provide essential secure communication channels for our Armed Forces in Afghanistan and allow all three Services to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of the satellites, Skynet 5A, was launched in March 2007, followed by Skynet 5B in November 2007, and Skynet 5C in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Prime Minister announces reduction in UK troop numbers in Afghanistan</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>UK force levels in Afghanistan are to reduce to around 5,200 by the end of 2013, the Prime Minister announced today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/" title="Number 10"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/" title="UK Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; that UK forces would shift from mentoring Afghan troops at battalion level to brigade level next year. This reflects the progress made in Helmand and the increasing ability and confidence of the Afghan National Security Forces (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;) to lead security operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawdown, agreed by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-security-council" title="National Security Council"&gt;National Security Council&lt;/a&gt; this week, is in line and consistent with both UK military advice and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization&lt;/a&gt; strategy agreed at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/events_66529.htm" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit, Lisbon 2010"&gt;Lisbon Summit in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, under which &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/" title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt;) forces continue to operate across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK forces will end combat operations by the end of 2014. It is part of transition to an enduring commitment to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement comes as the previously announced reduction of UK force levels from 9,500 to 9,000 is being achieved with service personnel due to arrive home in time for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed work on how force levels will reduce in 2013 is ongoing and will be conducted in line with operational requirements and the transition process which remains on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the Afghan forces increasingly take the lead, UK combat operations will give way to an increasing focus on training and advising. By the end of 2013, it is expected that UK forces will not routinely need to mentor Afghan forces below brigade level, allowing the reduction in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The real progress being made on the ground in Helmand province will allow us, on current planning, to reduce British troops to around 5,200 by the end of 2013. This is a direct result of the success of the Afghan National Security Forces in assuming a lead role in delivering security for the Afghan people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The phased process of transition of security responsibility agreed at the Lisbon Summit is well advanced and on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have consistently said that there will not be a cliff-edge reduction in troop numbers at the end of 2014. This gradual drawdown is firmly in line with the planning of our &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; partners and the advice of military commanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UK forces will continue to operate alongside their Afghan counterparts, albeit in lower numbers, until our combat operations cease at the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There remain huge challenges ahead for the Afghan people. Our combat mission is drawing to a close, but our commitment to the Afghan people is long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Members of the Afghan National Army" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5775/JMOCCCT-2012-014_Op_Horhari_Afghan_004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Members of the Afghan National Army take part in an operation in Helmand province (stock image) [Picture: Sergeant Steve Blake RLC, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Afghan National Army and Police have greatly improved in the past years. Their capability has increased so that today they enjoy the trust of some 84 percent of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As they develop, and in agreement with the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;, the efforts of our Armed Forces will continue to shift from a combat role to one that focuses on training, advice and assistance. That will allow us to make appropriate and measured reductions in our force levels in line with the &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; plan and our Chicago commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These drawdown plans are based on military advice and following discussion with General Allen [Commander &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Forces]. I am confident that the progress we have seen in Helmand and across Afghanistan can be maintained and that we can complete the tasks we have been set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To be in the position where we are now able to commit to reducing UK force levels to around 5,200 by the end of next year is testament to the professionalism and courage of those personnel who have served, and continue to serve, in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must remember that the UK’s commitment to the operation in Afghanistan will continue beyond the end of 2014 as &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/" title="Department for International Development"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [Department for International Development] and the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office" title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt; continue to build the government and nation while the UK’s pledge to support the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;, including training the military’s officers, will be ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant progress in Afghanistan continues with 75% of the Afghan population now being secured by the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; and at least 80% of all patrols being &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;-led.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of 80 UK bases at the start of the HERRICK 16 deployment this April, only 32 remain active with the others having been handed over to Afghan forces or closed. Afghan National Army numbers in Helmand province now stand at about 18,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Christmas message from the Defence Secretary</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has written a Christmas message to all Service and civilian personnel.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full text of the message is reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 has been a busy and challenging year for Defence - on operations in Afghanistan, on our many other overseas commitments, and here at home, delivering security for the Olympics and beginning the huge process of Defence Transformation. You should be proud of what you have achieved in the last 12 months - military and civilian personnel working together to protect our security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, 20th Armoured Brigade, 12th Mechanized Brigade, and now 4th Mechanized Brigade, have built on the hard work and sacrifice of their predecessors. This has been another tough year in Helmand province and we should remember, in particular, the members of our Armed Forces who have lost their lives or who have been seriously injured. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten. However, we should be in no doubt about the importance of the mission or the significant progress that we are making with our &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; (International Security Assistance Force) partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; (Afghan National Security Forces) take on ever more responsibility for security, we will be able to make further significant reduction in UK troop numbers in theatre next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, this summer, at short notice, you stepped in to undertake the largest peacetime operation since World War II, helping to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games such a resounding success, and in the process you demonstrated to the British public and visitors from across the world that your reputation for the highest standards of professionalism is well deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our main effort has been on operations, we have also continued the vital task of transforming Defence to ensure that we have the people, equipment and training to maintain our battle-winning edge in the post-Afghanistan security environment. A balanced budget is the foundation upon which this rests and we must continue to ensure that we maintain our budget discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I know that achieving that balanced budget, and in particular reducing the number of military and civilian personnel, has been a painful process for many. I also recognise that there is a need for certainty over the future laydown of the Armed Forces and the structure of DE&amp;amp;S (Defence Equipment and Support). These are both complex tasks, but I will announce the outcomes and provide that certainty as soon as I can next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we undertake this process of transformation, it is important to keep in mind what we are aiming for: the most capable, deployable and best-trained armed forces in the world, supported by a lean, efficient MOD and a procurement operation that delivers the maximum effect for every pound of taxpayers’ money. There is still a long way to go to deliver this, but I want everyone, whether military or civilian, to be proud of what we are achieving in Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to thank you all for the hard work, commitment and professionalism you have shown in 2012. I am proud to lead such a capable team of men and women. To those of you spending Christmas away from home, you will be in our thoughts. For those of you not on operations, I hope you enjoy the Christmas break. Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Right Honourable Philip Hammond MP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/12/14 - The Sovereign’s Parade </title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech delivered by Secretary of State for Defence at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on Friday 14 December 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commandant, Officer Cadets and staff of the Royal Military Academy, Your Highnesses, Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and privilege for me to represent Her Majesty The Queen at this Sovereign’s Parade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by congratulating the Officer Cadets on today’s excellent parade.You have achieved the highest standards in your turnout, drill and bearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that all of you, whether commissioning today or not, will have spent many hours preparing for this morning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meticulousness of your turnout and the precision of your performance reflects great credit upon you; and also great credit on your instructors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I congratulate the staff of the Academy on their commitment and attention to detail. The young men and women standing before me could not have achieved such high standards without your leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you being commissioned today can take great pride in completing an extremely demanding course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 44 weeks, or longer for some, you will no doubt have learnt a great deal about yourselves, your strengths and weaknesses, and about your fellow cadets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first intake of cadets here in 1812 included some of those who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 200 years, the Royal Military Academy and its forbears has taken cadets like you and turned them into first class officers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you pass out today, the last cohort to do so in this 200th Anniversary year, in front of the family and friends who have supported you, you are following in the footsteps of officers who have served with great courage and distinction around the world…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Waterloo to the Crimea, the Western Front to the liberation of Europe from Hitler’s tyranny and, more recently, the conflicts in Korea, the South Atlantic, Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history, tradition and reputation of Sandhurst, combined with the quality of the course and the demanding nature of the training you have undergone, should give you great confidence as you go to join your regiments and corps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Defence Secretary, I am well-placed to appreciate what a unique military leadership institution Sandhurst is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The qualities it instils in its young commanders are universally recognised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a measure of the pre-eminence of the Sandhurst “brand” that whenever I meet my counterparts around the world, the question of places here for their cadets is invariably on the agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that in Afghanistan, when attention focussed on establishing an Officer Academy for the Afghan Army, they looked instinctively to Sandhurst as their model, and to the British Army for help in developing the training programme, character and ethos for the Afghan National Army Officer Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, today, there are 70 overseas cadets on parade from 34 different countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kazakhstan to Southern Sudan, and from China to Nigeria…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…including the first officer to pass out from Bosnia and Herzegovina… and, indeed, a number of cadets from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted that you have come here for your training.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of you, it will have been a tough and character-forming experience; not only the course itself, but having to get to grips in many cases with the English language, the English weather and English food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you leave here and return to your home countries, you will hold a special status as Sandhurst-commissioned officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The friendships and bonds that you develop here with your fellow cadets…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…will, as you rise up your respective chains of command, help to form the crucial defence relationships of tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also take with you an understanding of what it is that allows us here in Britain to recruit some of the very best people our country can provide to preserve the unique attributes of our armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a civilian, I can say that the “moral component” of defence, that which instills the “will to fight” and the ability to endure and overcome hardship, is not widely understood outside the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is something that I have come to appreciate over the last year or so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is easy to forget in this time of rapid technological development that delivering military effect is not just about having the most advanced kit and equipment, important though that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains, as it has always been, fundamentally about people, the quality of them, the discipline they display and the doctrine that dictates how we employ them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what gives us here in Britain our qualitative edge over other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of which will have larger armed forces than us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of which will have similar equipment to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But very, very few of which can come close to matching our military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is because of the calibre of the people in our armed forces, the training they receive, the doctrine that guides them and the esprit de corps that binds them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those qualities will become ever more vital in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK defence is shifting its posture from campaigns to contingency, moving from supporting long-standing, fairly predictable, largely land-based operations, to providing high readiness, highly capable contingent forces, able to respond to the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army of the future will be smaller than today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it will also be more flexible, highly-deployable and better-equipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing these changes while maintaining the Army’s battle-winning edge will require the right people with the right training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education you have received and the skills you have acquired here at Sandhurst will be essential to delivering the future Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As officers in that Army, the challenges you encounter and the demands placed on you will be less predictable than for some of your predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you what the next major operations will be. I can’t tell you where you will be deployed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do know that Sandhurst has prepared you to deal with the challenges you will face, in whatever form they come… and from whatever quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s ceremony is a mark of the trust the nation, through its Sovereign, now bestows on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be proud of what you have achieved…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proud of the traditions and values of the Army you are joining…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And proud of the commitment you are making to the service of your Queen and your country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in return for that commitment, as Secretary of State for Defence, I will do everything I can to support you and your families…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the Military Covenant that is the embodiment of the pact between our society and those who defend it through military service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to uphold the principle that the first duty of government is defence of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today is your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Army officers, you are about to embark on one of the most rewarding careers to be found anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the courage, self-discipline and leadership you display will be met with loyalty and respect by those you will command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I congratulate you on your achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend to you the hard work and commitment ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wish you all the very best of luck for the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The Defence Secretary on delivering value for money and innovation in Defence</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has outlined the vision for delivering value for money and innovation in Defence at the Reform Defence Conference in London.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking yesterday, Mr Hammond used his speech to talk about how, over the last two-and-a-half years, the Department has set about reforming the way Defence is managed in order to deliver improved efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He began by recapping the scale of the reform challenge faced by Defence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The overheated equipment programme this government inherited was a symptom of a much deeper malaise that was fundamentally about the way in which the Department operated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without fundamental reform in the way the budget is managed, the way decisions are taken, and how Defence is run, the same problems will rematerialise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two-and-a-half years of the transformation project, the Defence Secretary said we have started to see the benefits of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But if we want them to be sustained, we need to ensure that the changes we are making in how Defence is managed become engrained in its culture so that budgetary discipline becomes the supporting foundation of everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Hammond said that while Defence needed a solid financial foundation, it was the people that really mattered and made the difference, and therefore an attractive employment package to attract and keep the best was needed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have to ensure that we can compete to attract them. And it has been 40 years since the current package of terms and conditions was last fully updated. In the meantime it has been adapted and modified on an ad-hoc basis. So that now, it is costly, complex, impenetrable and inflexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In many ways, it fails to meet the requirements of today’s Service personnel, or to reflect the needs of modern family life. So we need to modernise the offer we make to our people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that a new employment model was needed and this would need to be flexible to meet the varying and individual needs of Service personnel: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no identikit soldier, sailor or airman. Each one is an individual, with different needs at different points in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that the package needs to be affordable and sustainable in the long-term and attractive to Service personnel and fair to the taxpayer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we look at the structure of pay and allowances it will be to make it more flexible and more responsive to individual needs as well as to better reflect the priorities of the Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But, within an envelope that is broadly cost-neutral overall, designed to deliver better value to the individual at the same broad cost to the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stressed that this ‘New Employment Model’, or NEM, isn’t a single project at all but a number of distinct workstrands addressing different challenges, and it is not about overnight transformation but will be a process out to 2020 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the NEM will be a measured shift in the nature of the offer: towards a greater emphasis on individual value, personal choice and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ensuring greater value to the individual through more flexible tailoring of the complex package that makes up Armed Forces remuneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And more stability to Service families through fewer moves, more opportunities for employment of the partners, and greater opportunities for home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On housing, Mr Hammond said that, in a 22-year career, as currently structured, a typical Service person could expect to be asked to move 10 or more times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We want this to change. As we bring the British Army back from Germany we want to offer more stability and in doing so make it possible for families to set down roots as civilian families do. Greatly reducing the need for family moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concluding, the Defence Secretary said we should not underestimate the scale of what is still to be done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The real, long-term challenge is to change behaviours, align incentives and shift the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So that the resource discipline that we have imposed feeds through into sustainable, bottom-up efficiency gain, not reduction in output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In other words, the challenge is now to improve the productivity of every part of the Defence organisation. Rejecting the notion that a given percentage cut in the Defence Budget must inevitably mean a similar percentage cut in our military capability. That is the key task for 2013 for the leadership of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;None of us is in any doubt about the scale of that task, but neither do we doubt its centrality to everything we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>£1.2 billion contract awarded for new attack submarine</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The MOD has awarded a £1.2 billion contract for Audacious, the latest Astute Class attack submarine to be built for the Royal Navy.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Astute-Class/Audacious" title="Audacious"&gt;Audacious&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth of 7 &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Astute-Class" title="Astute Class"&gt;Astute Class&lt;/a&gt;  submarines being built for the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. They are the most technologically-advanced the Royal Navy has ever sent to sea and offer a step-change in capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.www.baesystems.com/" title="BAE Systems"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; will safeguard 3,000 skilled jobs at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria and represents a significant step forward in the Astute submarine programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 2 boats, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Astute-Class/HMS-Astute" title="HMS Astute"&gt;Astute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Astute-Class/Ambush" title="Ambush"&gt;Ambush&lt;/a&gt;, are currently undergoing sea trials to rigorously test their systems. Astute has conducted deep dive trials and successfully fired Tomahawk land attack missiles and Spearfish torpedoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambush’s ability to dive and surface has been successfully tested, as has her propulsion system, and the third boat, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Astute-Class/Artful" title="Artful"&gt;Artful&lt;/a&gt;, is reaching the final stages of her construction at Barrow shipyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD can also confirm today that a further £1.5 billion has been committed to the remaining 3 submarines in the class. This has enabled early build work to start on the next boat (&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Astute-Class/Anson" title="Anson"&gt;Anson&lt;/a&gt;) and long lead items to be ordered and bought for the as yet unnamed boats six and seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This £1.2 billion contract marks an important step forward in the progress of the Astute programme and moves the Royal Navy closer to adding more of these highly advanced and powerful attack submarines to its fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am also pleased to announce today that the MOD is committing more than £1.5 billion for boats five, six and seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Astute " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1735/45150807.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HMS Astute sails up the Clyde estuary (library image) [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) J J Massey, Crown Copyright/MOD 2009]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This funding demonstrates our commitment not only to a key Royal Navy capability but also to the submarine industry in Barrow which will play a vital role in Astute for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rear Admiral Simon Lister, MOD’s Director of Submarines, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Astute Class will become the jewel in the crown of the Royal Navy’s Submarine Service and boasts much greater firepower and more advanced sonar and communications than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These submarines represent a huge leap forward in technology and will operate all over the world with the Royal Navy. These boats provide the optimum capability a submarine can offer in land strike, strategic intelligence-gathering, anti-submarine and surface ship warfare, and protection of the strategic deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featuring the latest nuclear-powered technology, the Astute Class never need to be refuelled and can circumnavigate the world submerged, manufacturing the crew’s oxygen from seawater as they go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7,400-tonne Astute Class are quieter than older submarines, and can operate covertly and remain undetected despite being 50% bigger than the Royal Navy’s current &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Trafalgar-Class" title="Trafalgar Class"&gt;Trafalgar Class&lt;/a&gt; submarines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/11/21 - Delivering Value for Money and Innovation in Defence</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech delivered by Secretary of State for Defence at the Reform Defence Conference, KPMG, Canada Square, London on Wednesday 21 November 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Armed Forces exist to protect our country and provide the ultimate guarantee of its security and independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be the first duty of Government, and everything we do in Defence is directed at supporting that objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating the military capability required to meet the needs of national security;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And delivering that capability on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most fiendishly complex tasks of Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the most expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With resources as tight as they are, the obligation to deliver value for money is paramount:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure every pound of taxpayers’ money spent on Defence has a tangible impact on delivering capability to the front-line and on the security of the nation;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, enhancing the efficiency of Defence delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I want talk about how, over the last two and a half years, we have set about reforming the way Defence is managed to deliver that improved efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restructuring the MOD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-configuring our Armed Forces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balancing the budget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting the equipment programme on a sustainable course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because none of this would be possible without the people who make up Defence, I want to say a bit about how we will modernise the offer that we make to the men and women of our Armed Forces, so that their terms and conditions, while they will never look like those associated with civilian employment, better reflect lifestyles in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to start by re-capping the scale of the reform challenge we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transformation"&gt;Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review kick-started one of the biggest change programmes taking place anywhere in the Western world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A change programme essential to ensuring that our Armed Forces can continue to defend our country, protect our interests and project our values abroad;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of a complex range of threats in a rapidly changing environment; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the powerful, adaptable and, crucially, sustainable Armed Forces we require;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all at a cost that the country can afford and on a scale that we can sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this change programme isn’t just about meeting the Future Force 2020 structure set out in the SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also about changing the way we deliver Defence to make sure we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overheated equipment programme this Government inherited was a symptom of a much deeper malaise that was fundamentally about the way in which the Department operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Levene’s Defence Reform Review set out clearly what the problems were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A focus on short-term affordability at the expense of long-term value for money and a lack of financial rigour throughout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Head Office, which was trying to micro-manage from the centre, disempowering the people who actually deliver in the Service Commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confusion over who was accountable for what&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Few levers for those who wanted to innovate and change behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An over-complicated and fragmented structure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And an unbalanced relationship between the Department and its suppliers - with poorly aligned incentives driving sometimes perverse behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting these problems resolved is every bit as important as eliminating the inherited black hole in the budget if we are to deliver sustainable, long-term change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without fundamental reform in the way the budget is managed, the way decisions are taken, and how Defence is run, the same problems will re-materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are getting on with implementing Lord Levene’s recommendations which we accepted in full:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the behaviours so that we do not repeat the same mistakes again;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focussing on long-term value, not short-term cash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering value for money by making sure we have modern, innovative ways of doing business;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where people accept responsibility for decisions and have the power to make them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing us to weed out duplication, red-tape, perverse incentives, waste and delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken as a whole, this is a 10 year reform plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, halfway through this Parliament, and half way between two SDSRs; a year and a half on from the Defence Reform Review; it is worth reflecting how far we have come already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came into the Department, many of the tough decisions on force structure had already been taken: to shrink the size of the MOD; to rationalize our equipment programme; and to reduce the size of the Navy, Army and the Air Force, while increasing investment in the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They just needed implementing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the senior management was beginning the process of changing the way Defence was managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make no apologies for the fact that I chose to focus on the money first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no option of continuing the ‘finger in the dam’ approach to Defence budgeting, which had resulted in the MOD lurching over a decade from budget crisis to budget crisis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salami-slicing each year in the hope that “something would turn up” to fund the programme in the next;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing projects further and further to the right in an unsustainable and ever-expanding bubble;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budgeting based on fantasy rather than reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ill-served the tax-payer, who ended up paying more for less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ill-served the Defence Industry, who found it impossible to invest with any certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it ill-served our Armed Forces, who could not plan with confidence politicians promised them would be delivered on time, to requirement and in the numbers expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have instituted an integrated financial and military capability planning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming prudently rather than optimistically, so that we can focus on value rather than on cash management; with a proper centrally held contingency reserve against the equipment programme, and (an innovation in MOD terms) an annual Departmental Unallocated Provision:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving from a culture of spending first and working out how to afford the long-term costs later to one of only committing to what we can be confident that we can deliver;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living within our means, rather than systematically planning beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our new cost controls in place, no project can be committed without a 10-year budget line to cover not only its procurement, but also its support costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we allocate projects to the committed core programme only at the point when they need to be committed in order to be delivered on time, and only in accordance with the military assessment of priority at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending a long-established “conspiracy” between the industry and the Department to “lock in” unaffordable projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By maintaining these simple disciplines, sensibly managing in-year budgets, and forecasting prudently, we are changing the dynamic in the equipment programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we still have to live with the legacy projects - against which we have now made prudent provision of financial contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will continue to have a negative effect on the Department’s public reputation for project management as their original fantasy budgets and timelines are exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can now make choices, based on military priorities, about which new capabilities we can afford, rather than which bits of the programme we have to cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by delivering this budgetary discipline we are already demonstrating the benefits to the Armed Forces and to Industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding projects when it is safe to do so, not cutting them because we have run out of cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I announced in May that we had achieved a balanced budget, I have been able to give the go ahead to some half a billion pounds of further investment in Equipment and Support, including targeting pods for fast jets, better protection systems for Tornado GR4, enhancements to MERLIN Helicopters and new FOXHOUND vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And further announcements are imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year is, I am told by old lags in the Department, the first in living memory that the MOD has not had to sit down in September and decide which programmes need to be cut or delayed in order to remain within spending control targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major step forward for the MOD and for the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Reform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have started to see the benefits of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we want them to be sustained, we need to ensure that the changes we are making in how Defence is managed become engrained in its culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that budgetary discipline becomes the supporting foundation of everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sustainability is considered in every decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building-in a focus on value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing structures and incentives to change behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging innovation to improve delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locking in the significant reductions in running costs we are achieving by making the organisation more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already on course to save approximately £2bn in non-frontline costs in the year 2014/15, compared to 2010/11 baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of this saving will be sustainable reductions, so we can expect to maintain high-levels of savings in following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a ten year period we expect to save around £15bn of non front line costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how"&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we are pushing authority and accountability down the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving Top Level Budget holders the freedoms and incentives they need to drive efficiencies and improve delivery in their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head Office is becoming smaller, on course to shrink by 25% by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly constituted Defence Board, which I chair, has been meeting regularly over the last year, providing strategic direction to the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delegated operating arrangements for Service Commands will go live in April 2013, including for the new Joint Forces Command which was stood up in April of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Service is doing detailed work on its own operating model, identifying which activities are to be modified or stopped, and where to prioritise resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bottom line is that they will have much greater control over planning for future capability requirement;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding where to concentrate resources to provide maximum effect;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking responsibility for living within the means provided, but with the freedom to innovate and establish better ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we are doing is bringing in private sector skills where we judge it necessary to help change behaviours and drive efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Business Services has been set up in a partnership with SERCO, who are providing the external management team to transform the organisation into a lean and effective shared services centre, building on best practice outside the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Infrastructure Organisation brings together all aspects of Defence infrastructure asset management and facilities management under one organisation for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now in the process of recruiting a strategic partner to help transform its business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps most significantly, the work to overhaul procurement, the Materiel Strategy, is developing fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticisms of the acquisition process in the Defence Reform Review were anticipated by Bernard Gray’s report for the previous Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Defence has lacked the right business skills and capabilities to manage what are some of the largest capital and infrastructure projects being undertaken in today the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the MOD has, too often, been a poor customer for industry - and in some cases, a soft touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are setting out to create a proper interface between the Defence Equipment &amp;amp; Support organisation and the Defence customers it serves enabling it in turn to be a more effective customer for its suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will require the recruitment of a private sector partner to deliver the high-level commercial and management skills that we currently lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently testing the value for money case for a Government Owned, Contractor Operated - or GOCO - entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final decision on the precise structure will be made in due course, but the bottom line is that the reformed DE&amp;amp;S, supported by a strategic partner, will be better by design at negotiating and managing contracts for the benefit of the tax-payer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the private sector partner injecting key disciplines, processes, skills and management freedoms into MOD’s procurement activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By refocusing the Head Office to providing strategic direction rather than micro-management, by empowering the Service Commands and other parts of Defence to deliver and to innovate, and by bringing in private sector partners with the skills and flexibilities to help them, this programme will deliver behaviour change from the bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a massive change agenda: In the Armed Forces, in the MOD and across the support organisations like DE&amp;amp;S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And change is often uncomfortable for the people at the heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me say unambiguously that our people in Defence are our biggest asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men and women of our Armed Forces - Regular and Reserves; the civilians who support them; and the people who work in the industries which supply them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to rebuild the trust of all of them after a period of sometimes traumatic change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to say something this morning specifically about how we will address the challenges of recruiting and retaining for the Armed Forces once the lure of deployment on operations is gone as we withdraw from our combat role in Afghanistan by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, hopefully, against the challenge of a healthier civilian economy as a competitor for talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="service-personnel"&gt;Service Personnel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my big learning curves over the last year has been understanding the unique nature of what the military call the “moral component” of Defence; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is that provides the “will to fight”, and the determination to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is that allows us to recruit some of the best people the country can provide to preserve the unique attributes of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives us our edge over other countries, many of whom have larger Armed Forces and similar equipment to us, but very, very few of which can come close to matching our military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our people that give Britain’s Armed Forces their special quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know that some of them feel, perhaps many of them feel, they have taken a bit of a pounding over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redundancies; downsizing; re-structuring; relocation; re-roling for the post Afghanistan world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all while fighting a long and difficult counter-insurgency and stabilization campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must often have felt like the perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future Armed Forces will continue to offer careers that are exciting, challenging and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we want to continue to recruit and retain the best people, both Regulars and Reservists, that may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to ensure that we can compete to attract them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it has been 40 years since the current package of terms and conditions was last fully updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime it has been adapted and modified on an ad-hoc basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that now, it is costly, complex, impenetrable and inflexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it fails to meet the requirements of today’s Service Personnel, or to reflect the needs of modern family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to modernise the offer we make to our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-employment-model"&gt;New Employment Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in doing so, we need to achieve three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to secure for Defence the people it needs - both in terms of quality and quantity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruiting to preserve the unique attributes of the Armed Forces by drawing adventurous, spirited and committed people to the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we need to reflect the changes in social, demographic and economic conditions in our society and the complexities of modern family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no identikit soldier, sailor or airman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one is an individual, with different needs at different points in their careers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no identikit Service career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a young recruit wants from the package may be very different from an NCO in his late 20s with a wife and small children - and we have to make sure that what we provide is an attractive offer for both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the package needs to be affordable and sustainable in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attractive to Service personnel and fair to the tax-payer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me be clear: this is not a cost cutting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at the structure of pay and allowances it will be to make it more flexible and more responsive to individual needs as well as to better reflect the priorities of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But within an envelope that is broadly cost-neutral overall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed to deliver better value to the individual at the same broad cost to the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this project “the New Employment Model”, or NEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it isn’t a single project at all but a number of distinct workstrands addressing different challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not about overnight transformation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a process out to 2020 and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed to meet the expectations of a generation that has yet to join the Service, as well as our current Servicemen and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some elements are capable of being delivered relatively early while others will take longer to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the NEM will be a measured shift in the nature of the offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards a greater emphasis on individual value, personal choice and responsibility;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring greater value to the individual through more flexible tailoring of the complex package that makes up Armed Forces remuneration;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more stability to service families through fewer moves, more opportunities for employment of the partners and greater opportunities for home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="housing--spousal-employment"&gt;Housing &amp;amp; Spousal Employment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accommodation lies at the heart of this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of our Regular Service personnel rely on publically provided accommodation because the job currently demands a very high degree of mobility around the UK - and sometimes beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 22 year career, as currently structured, a typical Service person could expect to be asked to move 10 or more times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want this to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we bring the British Army back from Germany we want to offer more stability and in doing so make it possible for families to set down roots as civilian families do. Greatly reducing the need for family moves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling the children of Service personnel to be settled in one area and to avoid frequent changes of school;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And making it easier for partners of Service personnel to find work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we do must of course be done in a way which continues to support operational capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our goal is to enable Service Personnel more freedom to make the choices that other people make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About where to live;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about whether to rent or buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, home ownership rates among current and former members of the Armed Forces are comparatively low, suggesting an element of systematic disadvantage - something which the Armed Forces Covenant commits us to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, alongside a steady improvement in the quality of service accommodation, we want to increase access to home ownership for Service personnel, providing realistic lifestyle choices to our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways this could be achieved and we will look at developing a range of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stark fact is that people in the Armed Forces, with a generous, non-contributory pension scheme, are accumulating significant wealth during their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a significant part of their total remuneration package cost that wealth creation but without them being able to access it to facilitate house purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that disadvantages them compared to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the challenge we have set ourselves is to explore models that would allow our people either to directly access some of that accumulating wealth or to use it to collateralise mortgage borrowing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting forces home ownership;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And removing an important element of disadvantage service people face relative to their civilian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would not, of course, remove the need for Service accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for younger, single service people, this will often be the right choice, or indeed, the only one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces will continue to provide subsidised accommodation for those who require it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, whether you are in the Forces or in a civilian job, taking on the responsibility of homeownership these days often requires two reliable incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So making it easier for the partners of service people to find and keep work is a critical precondition to boosting home ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making military basing more settled will be a big step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also recognise that some bases, by necessity, are in relatively remote locations with limited employment opportunities for partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas I want to explore urgently in 2013 is how we could use parts of the military estate to stimulate local economic growth and employment generation around garrisons - by providing incentives for business relocation to land that we hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus creating conveniently located job opportunities for the Armed Forces community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, the New Employment Model will include everything from the accommodation and home ownership issues which I have discussed today, to overall pay structure, training and education needs, career management and manpower control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NEM will support both Regular and Reserve personnel - and will build on the Whole Force concept and the integration of Regular and Reserves which I set out earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, we will begin consulting with Service personnel, and testing some of the ideas we are developing on the people they are designed to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have set out this morning, the progress we have made on one of the most ambitious transformation programmes ever undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A programme necessary to ensure that our Armed Forces are affordable and sustainable, as well as flexible and effective in the face of both fiscal challenges and strategic uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not undervalue what we have already achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we should not underestimate the scale of what is still to be done.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have defined the new structure of our forces and the shape of the MOD that will support them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed our plan to bring the army home from Germany;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And an Equipment Programme which can be delivered and afforded;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms to maintain budget discipline are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is, relatively speaking, the easy bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real, long-term challenge is to change behaviours, align incentives and shift the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that the resource discipline that we have imposed feeds through into sustainable, bottom-up efficiency gain, not reduction in output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the challenge is now to improve the productivity of every part of the Defence organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejecting the notion that a given percentage cut in the Defence budget must inevitably mean a similar percentage cut in our military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that requires a motivated and engaged workforce;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One that recognises the challenges we are facing;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares our vision for the future of Defence;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understands the plan for delivering it;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And feels a valued part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of redundancy and pay restraint, that is a big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is the one we must now address;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through greater empowerment, both personal and professional;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And through better delivery of value to the individual from the remuneration package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the key task for 2013 for the leadership of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us is in any doubt about the scale of that task;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But neither do we doubt its centrality to everything we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>146/2012 - A fresh start for Britain’s Reserves</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Measures to overhaul Britain’s Reserve Forces, to create a fully integrated Armed Forces, were unveiled today as part of a wide-ranging consultation published by the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation, ‘Future Reserves 2020: Delivering the Nation’s Security Together’, proposes more training for Reservists, a ‘kitemark’-type award for supportive employers, and the idea of changing the ‘Territorial Army’s’ name to reflect their enhanced role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the proposals there will be a new relationship between Reservists, Employers and Government, a transparent approach with employers given more certainty about the timing of possible mobilisations and more notice when they occur. The measures will create a fully integrated force of Regulars and Reservists, using similar equipment and training together. It will mean that the Reserves not only produce individual augmentees to Regular Units, but also deploy as formed units and sub-units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of trained Reserves will grow to around 35,000 across all three Services by 2020, aligning the mix of Regular and Reserve components with many of our closest allies. The Army will see the biggest change with 30,000 trained Reserves, creating a total land force of about 120,000. And the plans are backed by an extra £1.8 billion in funding over the next ten years for new equipment, uniforms and training for the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will also look at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increasing the number of days Army Reservists are required to train – from 35 to 40 days a year; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a change of name from ‘Territorial Army’ to Army Reserve – better reflecting the future role and tasks; and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encouraging more ex-Regulars to become Reservists – making it easier for them to transfer to the Reserves and developing incentives for them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This transformation of the Reserves will see a radical shift in the way in which we use them, with units deployed as formed units or sub-units as well as delivering individual augmentees. Increased training, better equipment and extra investment in our Reserves are all integral to our vision of a formidable, adaptable and flexible Armed Forces, with a Reserve/Regular balance more in line with our main allies.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Government has committed £1.8 billion to rebuilding our Reserves. The consultation I have launched today is about working with Reservists, their families and employers to use that money to design the Reserve forces of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vice Chief of Defence Staff General Nick Houghton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since 2003 there have been over 25,000 Reservists mobilised, fighting alongside their Regular counterparts. 29 have paid the ultimate price for their country and just this summer we saw 2,000 Reservists provide a pivotal security role at the London 2012 Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the future we will become even more reliant on our Reserves. But this increased reliance means that there are key issues that we have to tackle – like our relationship with employers and the notice period ahead of mobilisation – to get this right. I want to encourage everyone to get involved in this consultation and have their say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 18 January 2013. Following this consultation we will publish a White Paper in Spring 2013 setting out this new relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consultation is available on the Ministry of Defence website. To view the consultation and have your say visit - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/CorporatePublications/ConsultationsandCommunications/PublicConsultations/FutureReserves2020Consultation.htm"&gt;http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/CorporatePublications/ConsultationsandCommunications/PublicConsultations/FutureReserves2020Consultation.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are currently 29,291 Reserves across all three Services. With 25,430 in the Territorial Army, 2,526 in the Maritime Reserve and 1,335 in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are growing the total strength of our Reserves to around 44,450 across all three Services by 2020, of which 35,000 will be fully trained (with a trained strength of 30,000 in the Army alone).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Ministry of Defence is investing £1.8 billion over the next 10 years to boost the Reserves with better training, new vehicles and radios and Regular Army uniforms. This is already having an effect:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 of the 26 Army Reserves overseas training exercises planned for 2012 and 2013 have already been conducted, in locations including Macedonia, Italy and Cyprus; &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;22 of these are new and a result of the new Future Reserves 2020 Funding. The Royal Navy and Royal Auxiliary Air Force have continued to provide overseas training opportunities;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;overseas exercises are expected to double next year; and&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;new uniforms in line with what their Regular counterparts wear, are being delivered to Reserve units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence already works in the “Partnering for Talent” programme with employers who see the value of Reserve training and development opportunities for their employees. Organisations already working with us in supporting the Reserves include – AA, BAE Systems, BT, Capita, Carillion, Department of Health, Manpower, HP, Rolls-Royce, Serco and the DWP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>2012/11/08 - Future Reserves 2020</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech delivered by Secretary of State for Defence at the BT Building, London on Thursday 08 November 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Michael [Michael Prescott, BT Director of Corporate Affairs], for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BT has been a prime mover in the Partnering for Talent initiative over the last 12 months and a proud track record of supporting the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces - both Regular and Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BT has recruited over 800 ex-service personnel in the last couple of years, and will be recruiting another 250 in the coming months - People who will serve the company well in the years to come, just as they have served the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of their induction, BT is actively supporting the maintenance of military links through service in the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is the Reserves that I’ve come here want to talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am publishing the MOD’s consultation on the future of the United Kingdom’s Reserve Forces, entitled ‘Future Reserves 2020: Delivering the Nation’s Security Together’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, our Reserves have fought alongside their Regular colleagues, in the Balkans, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, taking the same risks, making the same sacrifice, decorated with the same honours and deserving the same recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like our Regular Forces, they have been stretched, but have risen to the challenges they have been set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, the structure of our Reserve Forces has been allowed to wither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite six reviews since the Cold War, their true potential remains unrealised, particularly that of the Territorial Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declining in number, starved of resources, with training cut, opportunities reduced, and morale suffering - they have had many years of a raw deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long, the Reserves have been the forgotten part of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today marks the beginning of a fresh start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fresh-start"&gt;Fresh Start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re setting out our commitment to a larger Reserve, both absolutely and as a proportion of overall service manpower;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better resourced, with an injection of £1.8bn over the next 10 years;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means better equipped and better trained, using the same kit as their Regular counterparts and becoming the sole repository of some specialist skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, in the future they will be part of a fully integrated force of Regulars and Reserves, able to deploy as formed units and sub-units, as well as continuing to augment Regular forces as individual Reservists where required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes I am proposing today, amount to a paradigm shift in the role of Reservists’ in delivery of the nation’s security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shift which will see Reservists routinely sharing responsibility for activities once the exclusive domain of Regular Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this shift, wider society will need to play a larger part in the delivery of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our National Security is everyone’s business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new relationship is required between the State and Armed Forces on the one hand and individual Reservists, their families and their employers on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exciting new proposition bringing with it new opportunities, and new challenges for Reservists, and for their employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Reservist - more responsibility, bringing with it more support, more respect, and more reward;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the employer - an open relationship based on mutual benefit, better exploiting the skills and motivation Reservists offer as employees, with appropriate packages, for different types of employer, of accredited training, recognition and impact reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for employers, Reservists and their families alike, greater predictability of liability for call-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this Green Paper will affect all Services: the Maritime Reserve, the Royal Marine Reserve, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, and the Territorial Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will be most keenly felt by the Army, who, on the basis of the plans set out this year for Army 2020, will need to fully integrate their Reservists into the very fibre of the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will concentrate most of my remarks today on the challenge facing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very nature of the TA’s new role will require a step change in organisation and approach to force generation, as well as in the relationship with employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A change that, I believe, should be reflected in a change in name to ‘The Army Reserve’ - and that is one of over 30 propositions that we will be consulting on over the next two months as part of a process leading to a white paper published in the Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before I put some flesh on the bones of these proposals, let me set the transformation of our Future Reserves in the context of the wider changes taking place in the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transformation"&gt;Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review called for redesign of our Forces to meet the new security challenges which will face them post-Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Future Force 2020, we are building an adaptable, integrated Whole Force fit for a more uncertain world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No longer focussed on the Cold War model of mass territorial defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor the predictable pattern of deployment to enduring operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But configured instead to project power and respond to a diverse set of contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile, high-tech, structured to allow rapid reaction and expeditionary warfare;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capable of conducting the full spectrum of operations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Able to command as part of a coalition and more interoperable with our main allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller, but better equipped;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because now that we’ve a balanced budget, with a sustainable equipment programme, our Armed Forces can be confident that they will receive the cutting-edge equipment that has been promised as we build the formidable capability that Future Force 2020 represents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation is necessary to prepare our Armed Forces for the challenges of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to deal with the legacy of the past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multi-billion pound black-hole in the Defence Budget that had to be filled, before we started to make a contribution to reducing the overall fiscal deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That meant some very tough decisions: relinquishing some capabilities, to invest in new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting smaller numbers, to ensure we can equip people properly for the job we ask them to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-reserve-legacy"&gt;The Reserve Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the SDSR implementation process, the Prime Minister set up an Independent Commission to provide an authoritative picture of the state of our Reserves and recommendations for optimising their use in the context of modern threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report they published in July last year makes for sobering reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that individual Reservists had made, and continue to make, an essential contribution to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At their peak, Reservists made up 20% of our Forces in Iraq and 12% in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best trauma unit in the world - the Camp Bastion Hospital - has been staffed, on average, 40% by Reservists and has nearly 50 Reservist medics currently on its staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 25,000 Reservists have deployed on operations overseas in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29 have paid the ultimate price, with many more injured, sometimes seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, given that this is remembrance week, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have sacrificed so much to preserve our national security and protect our national interests - serving and veteran; regular and reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the amazing efforts of individual Reservists to make a difference, and the hard work of many unsung Reserve Units up and down the country from all the services, the Commission found an organisation in institutional decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting smaller, getting older, less well trained, less motivated;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not matched to the new security environment - with major units of the TA still configured to provide mass reinforcements to counter the Soviet threat; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not able to be mobilised for routine deployments - with the legal position not supporting the use of Reserves for standing tasks;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not matched to the new configuration of the regular Armed Forces;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forming too small a part of our overall military capability, both in comparison to our closest allies of similar tradition - and indeed by our own historic standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even during the last decade of enduring operations, to which the TA made such a contribution, its nominal strength fell by almost a third with the Reserves Commission reporting some estimates of genuine trained strength as low as 14,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long, the Reserves were considered a soft target by the last administration as they desperately tried to find in-year savings measures to cover their failure to control the spiralling cost of the equipment programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on live round firing;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of equipment curtailed;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the then Government tried to cut the TA’s annual budget by 30% with a reduction in drill nights and weekend training, to balance the in-year budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of all of this has been Reserve Forces failing to realise their potential; failing to recruit to requirement, with a proposition that is simply not attracting enough potential Reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A diminishing return on capability and a diminishing return to Defence;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So change is not just desirable, it is essential for the future of our Reserve Forces and the contribution they make to the Defence of our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that change is required not only in the organisation, structure and role of Reserve Forces - and how they are integrated with Regular Forces - but it is required in the proposition we make to Reservists and in the relationship we have with their employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what will the Future Reserve of 2020 look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will this mean for what we ask of our Reservists, their families and their employees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is the fresh start we are proposing today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="future-reserves-2020"&gt;Future Reserves 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is fully committed to delivering the Reserve Forces the country needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are investing an additional £1.8bn in the Reserves over the next 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment will support an increase in our Reserve Forces…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…to a trained strength in the Army Reserve of 30,000;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maritime Reserve of 3,100;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Royal Auxiliary Air Force of 1,800.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in 20 years the planned trajectory is up, not down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the effect of this investment is already beginning to show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already reversed the decline in the Army Reserve in terms of recruitment and total strength - with enlistments this year 3% up against the rolling average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New training and new equipment is being rolled out progressively, with delivery of new uniforms, new vehicles and new radios, in line with those used by Regulars, already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening, I was at Fulham TA Centre visiting the Royal Yeomanry to see their new light reconnaissance vehicles and Bowman radios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more money, higher numbers and better equipment, however welcome, will not alone turn our Reserves into the efficient, effective, and deployable Force our national security requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Whole Force concept of full integration between Regular and Reserves will require us to redefine the role that Reserves will play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to restructure them to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Forces will continue to deliver specialist capabilities which cannot be cost-effectively held in Regular Forces, particularly in the medical field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we intend to extend the range of specialities, drawing on skills from the civilian workforce, such as intelligence, information technology and cyber. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will also provide functions that do not require complex unit-level training to maintain readiness, such as some aspects of logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserves will fulfil a general role in homeland security, such as the support they provided to the Olympics, and to national resilience tasks, such as flood relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will provide, as they do now, vital support to short-term high impact operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they will provide resilience to longer term stabilisation operations, like the Balkans and Afghanistan - providing a higher proportion of the committed force than is currently the case, increasing the longer the operation goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual Reservists will continue to be mobilised as augmentees for regular units as now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will also be deployed as formed units and sub units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Reserve Forces will be expected to fulfil new roles too, including contributing to standing commitments such as the Falklands and to defence engagement work abroad, such as conflict prevention and capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This financial year, over 20 new overseas training exercises will take place for the Army Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hundred Reservists from the 6th Battalion, the Rifles recently spent two weeks in Germany training alongside their Regular Regimental colleagues from 5 Rifles in Exercise Leopard Star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise centred on the Warrior Armoured vehicle and was designed to develop the kind of integration between regular and Reserve that will be necessary to meet the demands of Future Force 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such exercises were rare in the past; they will be more common in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reservists will routinely be part of deployments at home and abroad and will routinely train with the Regulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will require a change in legislation, redefining the circumstances in which Reserves can be mobilised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, they will be a fundamental part of how we provide military capability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of a ‘Whole Force’, alongside their Regular counterparts, the civilians who support them and the Defence Industry which supplies them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ‘Whole Force’, designed to ensure the nation’s security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are some who have questioned whether we can achieve the growth in Reserve Forces that we have set out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these new levels are well within historic norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1990, the TA was 72,500 strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army Reserve we are proposing is modest in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while the new targets are ambitious, they are clearly achievable, and I am determined to deliver them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, we will need the support of employers, as well as potential Reservists and their families to deliver this ambition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="proposition-for-reservists"&gt;Proposition for Reservists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In identifying respective Reservists, we’re looking for people who are going to turn out when they’re required to turn out, who are going to do the training they need to do and who are available for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Army Reserve, they will be expected to undertake an extended training regime of around 40 days a year after basic training is completed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will be structured as one 16 day deployment and the balance at weekend and evenings, avoiding any added burdens on employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the message to future Army Reservists is clear: promise us you will make the commitment; turn up regularly to train and be prepared to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in return, we promise to equip you, train you, fund you and use you as an integral part of the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because you will be integrated with the Regulars and deployed more routinely, there will be greater opportunities for promotion and command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A balanced package of remuneration and support will be developed for Reservists and their families and provided as part of the ‘New Employment Model’ the MOD is developing for our Armed Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will support an integrated approach to pay and allowances and enable a much closer alignment of regular and Reservist careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will provide a much better deal for the families of Reservists, with help to access the support and networks available to Regulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outwith a genuine national emergency, we will also provide predictability to deployment, which will help at home as well as at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine liability in the Army Reserve will be for no more than one six month deployment in 5 years - although the total period of mobilisation would be longer - in some cases up to a year - to encompass operation specific training and post-operation recuperation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some mobilisations will be much shorter - for example the Reserve element of the contribution to Olympics was only mobilised for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will be able to indicate in advance when the potential period of deployment will occur for any individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all these changes, this is an exciting proposition for Reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenging, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the Reserve Forces of the future, we need people who genuinely want to serve their nation and are committed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this proposition will be appealing to those leaving the Regulars, as well as to the Volunteer Reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an average year, over 18,000 people leave the regular forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, they have a liability for reserve service for a time limited period after they leave the regulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few serve actively in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could make better use of this asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making an attractive offer to departing regulars to remain voluntarily engaged in the Reserve we will do two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll help ourselves with numbers - just 10% of departing regulars taking up active Reserve Service would take us a significant part of the way to meeting our target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it will also strengthen the resilience of the Reserves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more ex-regulars we have in the Reserves, the easier it will be for the Reserves to integrate with the Regulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-relationships-with-employers"&gt;New Relationships with Employers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this proposition for Reservists themselves is only one part of the jigsaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often in the past we’ve recruited the Reservist and then left him or her to worry about how to tell the employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though our plans call for a Reserve that will represent only 0.1% of the total UK workforce, I do not believe that we can achieve our ambitions without the active cooperation of employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this fresh start for the Reserves is also a fresh start for the relationship between the Armed Forces and the businesses who employ their Reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to work with employers, building partnerships that deliver mutual benefit from Reserve Service;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joint approach to leadership and management training;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration on skills training;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together to develop potential in students before they graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All will require a genuinely open relationship between Employer, Reservist and the Military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the employer understanding the Reservist’s liability and the Reservist confident that his service will not prejudice employment or promotion prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And underpinning this new relationship will be a tailored approach for different types of employer, reflecting the different benefits and impacts Reserve Service can have on companies in different sectors and of different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that Reserve Service will affect small employers differently from large ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth, of course, is that with the growth of statutory leave entitlements - and other flexible working practices - employers of all sizes are becoming much more used to managing periods of absence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it is likely that public sector and large private sector organisations will be best placed to manage Reservists in their workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I see a real opportunity to work with major employers, like BT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers who are already engaging through the Partnering for Talent Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies take great pride in supporting our Reservists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They see it as part of their corporate social responsibility; a great way of showing commitment to society at large&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are leading the way and helping us shape an adaptable and flexible Defence Force with an increased role for the Reserves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only right that we recognise these companies and the Green Paper suggests a new ‘Kitemark’ type award for Reserve-friendly employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not just about Corporate Social Responsibility: it must also be about mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many employers see very clearly the benefit that Reserve training and experience brings to them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering motivated, skilled, talented employees representing the values of the wider Armed Forces - integrity, application and commitment;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership training that is different from its civilian counterpart, adding a dimension to the skills of the work force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will consult on expanding the accreditation of skills and experience gained in reserve service through recognised civilian qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing direct benefit to employers through reduced training costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will consult, too, on the scope for linking apprenticeships and Reserve service in a package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable this open relationship we are proposing to introduce a voluntary charter for employers of Reservists, recognising the contribution that good employers make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we will also consider anti-discrimination legislation if we see evidence of systematic disadvantage to the Reservist in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the shape of the fresh start for our Reserve Forces and our proposition to employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Reservist: an exciting opportunity to be an integrated and respected part of the Defence of the nation - at the centre, not sidelined - with greater opportunities and better rewards - but with more responsibilities and commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the employer: a new relationship of mutual benefit - with packages designed for specific types of business - helping them to make better use of the skills, talents and training of Reservists - as well as an opportunity to support our Armed Forces and be recognised for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for Reservists, their families and employers alike - greater certainty and greater predictability to Reserve Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the investment we are making, the Reserves are no longer the forgotten part of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we go forward, they will be at its very heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
