    <title>FCO Minister shows continued UK support to Libyan people on trip to region</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Libya the Minister will offer continued support to the Libyan people as they build a new future after Qadhafi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from Tripoli, Mr Burt said:          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be back in Libya for the third time in twelve months. Since my last visit in April, Libya has held incredibly successful elections, convened a new General National Congress and formed a new Government. I congratulate President Magarief, Prime Minister Zeidan and the Libyan people on these significant achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The new Government faces many challenges: improving security across Libya, particularly taking steps to ensure that armed groups are reintegrated into society, respect government decisions and act within the law; strengthening the justice system to ensure the transfer of all detainees to the custody of the state, where they must be held in accordance with international standards; delivering improved public services to its people; and reforming and revitalising the economy to provide better jobs and opportunities for ordinary Libyans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These challenges are significant but the British Government will continue to support Libya throughout its transition. I am meeting the Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers for Justice and Finance to discuss how the UK can build on its current work to offer even greater assistance to the Libyan Government. I am also meeting a delegation of politicians, business leaders and civil society activists from Benghazi to reiterate our ongoing commitment to the East of Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During these meetings I will emphasise the importance of securing justice for the victims of the Qadhafi regime in the UK, and I look forward to the continued cooperation of the Libyan authorities in resolving these outstanding legacy cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Foreign Office Minister welcomes UN resolution condemning the human rights situation in Iran</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome yesterday’s adoption of this resolution on the human rights situation in Iran by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. The overwhelming number of votes in support represents a clear statement by the international community that this situation is unacceptable and should be condemned.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Iran’s human rights record remains appalling. The last twelve months have seen multiple violations by the regime of its human rights obligations. There has been widespread use of the death penalty, further curbs on free expression, the increase in targeted harassment of minority groups and worrying reports of mistreatment in custody - in some cases leading to prisoner deaths. These abuses have been compounded by the complete lack of transparency in Iran’s judicial processes and the persistent failure of the regime to observe its own laws and constitution.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tragically, it is not simply those brave men and women who stand up to the regime in defence of human rights who are targeted. Mothers, teachers, Facebook users, ordinary people going about their lives, are affected on a daily basis.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Iran’s actions fail to match its public rhetoric on human rights. It has supported the rights of protest in the Arab world whilst denying those rights to its own people. It encourages dissent elsewhere, yet refuses its own citizens the right to express criticism about Iran or debate the concerns of the international community. The UK will continue to highlight the abuses perpetrated by Iran against its citizens. We expect Iran to live up to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights it freely ratified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the one year anniversary of the publication of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Establishing the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry was an unprecedented and positive response to the unrest which hit Bahrain in Spring 2011. We fully acknowledge the leadership it took to accept its findings and the commitment made by His Majesty to deliver reforms based on their recommendations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We commend the steps taken so far, including ensuring that the National Security Agency does not have the authority to arrest and detain individuals, the establishment of a Special Investigations Unit to determine the accountability of those who committed unlawful or negligent acts, and the establishment of a Police Ombudsman to receive complaints and grievances and to oversee and conduct investigations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we are concerned by some of the recent decisions taken by the Bahraini Government, particularly on human rights, and we’re clear that there are areas where progress on implementation has been too slow and others where it is lacking. Much more needs to be done on relaxing censorship and allowing the opposition greater access to media, on integrating personnel from all communities in Bahrain into the security forces, and question marks remain on senior level accountability for the deaths and the allegations of torture following the unrest of 2011. The Bahraini Government has itself acknowledged that more work still needs to be done and the UK stands ready and willing to assist in whatever way we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Commission’s report revealed deep-rooted issues that pose significant challenges for the Bahraini Government and will take time to fully address, as will a change in behaviour and culture. There have also been increasingly violent protests on the streets, which are unacceptable. As Bahrainis today mark the first anniversary of the landmark BICI report, we urge the Bahraini Government to show a renewed sense of energy and commitment to implementing all the recommendations, and we call on all community leaders to play a constructive role in this process for the long-term stability of the Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>FCO Minister condemns violence and calls for peaceful progress in Bahrain</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister for the Middle East and North Africa said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This week I spoke to the Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa ahead of the first anniversary of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) report into the uprising in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed the recent increase in violent attacks, which are deeply worrying and only serve to undermine prospects for reconciliation and long-term stability in Bahrain. The UK condemns any group that engages in this type of violent action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome the constructive steps taken last week by Al-Wefaq and five other opposition political societies to condemn violence in a Declaration of Principles of Non-violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to encourage the Government to lift the temporary ban on protests, and urge all sides to pursue their objectives through peaceful action and meaningful dialogue.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Office Minister welcomes Middle East champions of reform to UK</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme, funded by the FCO’s Arab Partnership programme, promotes good governance and the rule of law in the Middle East and follows a successful pilot project last year. It is part of a major UK Government policy initiative to assist those countries in the Middle East which are working to create more open and pluralistic societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the meeting Minister Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today I met 17 inspirational individuals who are helping drive reform across the region. Each has a unique story and I am proud that the UK’s visionary Arab Partnership programme has been able to join with the John Smith Memorial Trust to help nurture and support their commitment to forging the foundations of democracy and accountability in their own countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A year ago a policewoman from Lebanon was part of this innovative project. Today thanks to the JSMT and Foreign Office funding she is championing equality and diversity in the Lebanese police force. It is this sort of work that, as countries across the Middle East chart their own individual journeys in the wake of the Arab Spring, will help ensure open societies which deliver stability and prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JSMT project shows how democracy can be a successful tool for securing good governance, for making the Rule of Law effective by advancing citizens’ human and legal rights, for empowering disadvantaged groups and for giving a voice to those who currently lack political influence. It is founded on the principle that Middle East countries will find their own way to achieve these goals, but looks to provide advice and support drawing on the UK’s long-history and experience in these areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fellows already hold senior positions in their governments or are active in business, law, journalism and civil society. This project helps them develop their own project ideas during their stay in London as well as supporting the implementation of these on their return home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s cadre include Rakan Madi and Wafa’ Nimri.  Rakan is working to energise the relationship between Jordanian voters and their elected representatives. He said the JSMT programme had given him “a great chance to shadow a member of parliament” and find out more about MPs’ responsibilities.  Wafa’ Nimri’s project seeks to counter misinformation in Jordan.  She  said her “experience with the John Smith Memorial Trust showcased  the rule of law and good governance in a system where collaborative ideas flourish and people are questioned and held to account. I loved it, it’s hands-on and spot-on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Support for a global Arms Trade Treaty</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday UN Member States voted overwhelmingly in support of a UN General Assembly Resolution that secured a resumption of negotiations on the Arms Trade Treaty. The Resolution convened a further UN conference from 18 to 28 March 2013 in New York. Speaking today, Minister responsible for the Arms Trade Treaty, Alistair Burt said:            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yesterday in New York, 157 countries pledged their support for a global Arms Trade Treaty. An overwhelming majority of states, including the US, China and India, voted for a return to UN negotiations in 2013 to finalise work on a Treaty that will save lives, reduce human suffering and bring consistency to the global trade in conventional arms. The UK has led the international efforts towards an Arms Trade Treaty since 2006 and, with the majority of the world alongside us, will redouble our efforts to secure a Treaty that will make a difference to millions of lives around the world. Agreement on an Arms Trade Treaty is closer than ever, and the UK will be at the forefront of efforts to finally secure this. I appreciate the public support which has underlined our approach and helped to secure this positive outcome.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the publication of tenders for 1213 settlement units in East Jerusalem and 72 in Ariel, the Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I condemn yesterday’s provocative decision to advance settlement construction in East Jerusalem and the West Bank through the publication of tenders for 1285 settlement housing units. The UK has been consistently clear that Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and by altering the situation on the ground are making the two state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital, increasingly hard to realise. It is deeply disappointing that the Government of Israel continues to ignore the appeals of the UK and other friends of Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The Arab Partnership</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, how nice to see everybody here to celebrate where we are to date with the Arab Partnership and to see so many friends from around the region; Excellencies, colleagues and friends to celebrate with us and I’m delighted to be joined by Alan [Duncan] as  part of it and of course you’ve got the very special speaker [Nesryn Bouziane] in between who speaks with even greater authority than, than Ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to say that we feel as Ministers we have the privilege of calling many people in this room partners, those from international and local civil society organisations, think tanks, the media, the private sector as well as colleagues from an array of British Government departments. We’re here because the work we’re doing through the Arab Partnership and Conflict Pool is of vital importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arab Spring is the beginning of unprecedented change in the Middle East and North African region towards the more open and accountable societies its people so emphatically demand. It’s also of great importance to the United Kingdom. Our security and prosperity on this island are closely linked to the region’s long-term stability but we have never thought that this long-term stability would appear overnight. I don’t agree with those who say the Arab Spring has become a winter. There are challenges: the economic troubles facing some countries in the region, the terrible ongoing violence in Syria - these must be overcome but they’re not the destination of the Arab Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Egypt under the former President Mubarak could any of us have conceived of a President elected democratically by popular consent? Could we have imagined, just a short time ago the political debate now common in Tunisia under the former President? And without the Arab Spring would Morocco be in the position of having a Prime Minister selected by Parliament? The answer to each of these questions is of course no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must take heart in these achievements, not minimise them, but remember that strong institutions like an independent judiciary, a vibrant civil society are the building blocks of democracy. They take generations to build and require constant vigilance to maintain. We must have the strategic patience to partner with the region over the long term to build the institutions needed for the long term stability that will benefit us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, we’ve stood by reformers in the region from the outset. Two years ago this week, before the Arab Spring began, we established the Arab Human Development Team, now the Arab Partnership Department, to analyse the drivers of discontent in the region. With this analysis in hand in Kuwait in January 2011 our Prime Minister, David Cameron, stepped out ahead of the international community. He pledged to support reformers as they led the momentous changes in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can be rightly proud that his blueprint for engagement with the region based on our values and our interests, coupled with the sensitivity to the unique context of each country in the region, has been adopted by leaders worldwide. A clear sign of United Kingdom influencing is in multilateral fora such as the G8 and EU and Alan [Duncan] will speak a little further about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011 we committed to add to the United Kingdom Government funds already being spent on conflict prevention in the region, a further one hundred and ten million pounds of Arab Partnership funding over four years to support political and economic reform. I don’t need to make claims about the success of our interventions so far, our partners in the region are already telling us this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leading Tunisian newspaper described an Arab Partnership funded project encouraging political debate on Tunisian TV as, I quote, “a possible solution to save a media that was worn out by dictatorship”. An officer in the Lebanese Army paid tribute to training provided through the Conflict Pool for helping save civilian lives and reducing casualties in recent flash points. And, the Moroccan Minister for Youth and Sports described, unprompted, the Arab Partnership as a wonderful opportunity for Arab youth to voice their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s celebrate success but let’s also prepare for the work there is still to do. Our support cannot and will not stand still. In July, I visited an ongoing Arab Partnership funded project training producers and journalists of Algerian TV, and as we speak BBC veteran, Tim Sebastian, is hosting a televised debate in Cairo on the progress of democracy in Egypt as part of the new Arab debates’ series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples. Around the room there are those who can speak of many more. We have colleagues from Parliament who are engaged in this work. I see many Ambassadors from the countries with whom we have a close relationship who have been keen partners in this project, who emphasise the way in which this is tailor made to the needs of their own states because that is what we are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am confident that those in the Department and those we partner with have that sensitivity in mind. We hope this will be a further opportunity for continuing progress in the time to come. We’re confident about the building blocks we’ve laid but most of all I’m confident about all the people we work with, their commitment to a region we all love so much, and to a future in which I’m sure so many of us have a perfect stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague met Indonesian President Yudhoyono this week during his state visit to the UK. The Foreign Secretary said: “This visit will be an opportunity for us to build on the strong partnership established over the last decade.” President Yudhoyono also met with the Queen, members of the royal family and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/president-yudhoyono-of-indonesia/"&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;. He also attended the UK High Level Panel meeting and gave a Wilton Park address on Indonesia’s role as a regional and global actor. The Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa wrote a guest post about the visit for &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/williamjhague"&gt;The Foreign Secretary’s facebook page&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit to hospital where Malala Yousafzai is receiving treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary, the Emirati Foreign Minister and the Pakistani Interior Minister visited the hospital where Malala Yousafzai is receiving treatment in the UK. Malala was shot by the Taliban after campaigning for girls’ right to education in Pakistan.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt attended an event at the Foreign Office with DFID Minister Alan Duncan to mark the second anniversary of the Arab Partnership. He said: “We must have the strategic patience to partner with the region over the long term, to build the institutions needed for the long-term stability that will benefit all.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT)&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt spoke at the GICNT symposium on the detection of nuclear material. He said: “We must prevent access to nuclear devices, materials and expertise by those who would seek to do us harm, while not impeding legitimate peaceful uses.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Professor Clary for your kind introduction. And my thanks to the co-chairs of the Global Initiative and our partners in this event, notably Atomic Weapons Establishment, the Ministry of Defence and our colleagues from the Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would first like to extend my appreciation to everyone here for taking the time from your busy schedules join us at Lancaster House to discuss one of the most important issues of our time: nuclear terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My portfolio as Minister in the Foreign Office covers 32 countries, ranging from the Middle East and North Africa to parts of South Asia. I have responsibility for our Counter-Proliferation, Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Piracy efforts. In the past year I have seen the continuous evolution of security challenges facing the UK; both conventional and non-conventional, domestic and international.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional conflict and instability have potential implications for wider peace and stability, which is why the UK’s National Security Strategy identified nuclear terrorism as a primary danger to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear terrorism is a real and global threat. A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic. Catastrophic for the immediate devastation and terrible loss of life, and for the far-reaching consequences - psychological, economic, political, and environmental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an attack was unthinkable just a generation ago. But it is now a possibility we need to confront with the utmost vigilance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear material is becoming more available - partly because more countries are deciding to adopt the benefits of nuclear energy. That is a sovereign right and a positive choice, and one which the UK will continue to support. We also recognise that some countries have chosen not to go down the path of nuclear energy. But this all means that we need together to ensure that, as nuclear materials and technology spread, we keep our people safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in today’s world of modern communication, information is spreading faster. Like nuclear energy, this brings huge benefits, but it also brings significant risks. There is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than there ever has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case in cyberspace, the danger is stateless in geographical space. It is impossible for any national government or police force, no matter how advanced, to contain on its own. Global smuggling networks are thriving. Criminal cells operate across borders and across continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are here today to renew our drive for the global response we need. We must prevent access to nuclear devices, materials and expertise by those who would seek to do us harm, while not impeding legitimate peaceful uses. Together we can agree and enforce the rules, secure the cooperation, and develop the capabilities and practices, to ensure that a nuclear terror attack never happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our determination to tackle this issue head on is the reason why, at the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism Plenary in South Korea last year, we announced that we would host this symposium. It is a clear demonstration of the UK’s commitment to this most important of issues, and our commitment to implementing the founding principles of the Global Initiative.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years ago the UK joined the Global Initiative, along with 12 other countries.  We were brought together through the strong leadership of the United States and Russia. Today the Global Initiative membership counts more than 85 nations and four official observers - all committed to strengthening the global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear terrorism.  Gathered at this symposium are some of the world’s leading experts on non-proliferation, counter proliferation and counterterrorism.&lt;br&gt;
The more I have read about the fight against nuclear material trafficking, the more I have appreciated the real difficulties you are working to address. Detecting the radioactive signature of heavy elements in nuclear contraband is challenging, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your fight against nuclear terrorism has introduced me to a fascinating - and, I must admit, mysterious - world filled with Muons, Cosmic-rays, and Large Hadron Colliders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology has come a long way. From its beginning in 1960s, when the Nobel prize winning physicist, Luis Alvarez, set up Muon detectors in a chamber beneath the second pyramid of Chephron in Egypt to look for hidden chambers.  To the development of Drift Tubes at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and on to the creation of the gas electron multipliers.  Now nuclear detection systems are being developed that only take up a cubic meter of space and can produce three-dimensional images. I do not pretend to understand fully the physics behind these technologies. And indeed, when a Muon was explained to me as a “heavy electron” I recall thinking that I did not find that description particularly illuminating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the serious point is that you here turn what sounds to the layperson like science fiction into tangible technologies that will help to prevent nuclear terrorism. Since the issue of illicit trafficking of nuclear material was first recognised the UK has been at the forefront of trying to combat this threat.  And, of course, it was an issue very much at the forefront of our security preparations for our hosting of a successful London Olympics this summer. You will hear more about this, and about the UK’s border monitoring system, Cyclamen, later in this symposium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only six months ago I would not have been able to openly discuss Britain’s work on detection as I am doing with you now. But building on the UK’s commitment to openness in this area and the work that we first revealed at the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit in March, I am especially pleased that I can publicly commend and promote the UK’s Atomic Weapons Establishment, or AWE as they are known, for their work in this area. This is a rare opportunity to publically acknowledge that their work has been central to the defence of the United Kingdom for over 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the creation of a broad programme that covers passive detection, active detection and Muon-based detectors is being led by AWE in partnership with the UK’s world-leading academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is delivering a range of prototypes in each area that will allow us to advance our research on this challenging problem. A particular success is the production of a Muon-based detector using novel technologies, providing both a test bed for advanced detection methods and also arms control verification tools. Again, I know you will hear more on this later in the symposium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the nuclear forensics domain we have built on AWE’s excellent resources and created a dedicated world-class nuclear forensics analytical capability that will allow the UK to investigate criminal acts involving nuclear materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes the recently-opened Conventional Forensic Analysis Capability, which allows us, for the first time in Britain, to examine traditional forensic evidence, DNA, Fingerprints, and more, that is contaminated with Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive material.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat again that it is a pleasure to be here today. I have learnt a lot in the short time I have had to discuss these fascinating issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we are here to help strengthen, widen and deepen the co-operation between our countries to stop nuclear material trafficking.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This symposium is an important contribution to this ambition. It is important not only for the security of our nations, but for the partnership that we are forging across the board to make the world a more prosperous, stable and secure place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
