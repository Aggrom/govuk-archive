    <title>Press Release: Geraint Jones appointed as reviewer for the Office For Fair Access</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, announced today that he is appointing Geraint Jones as the statutory reviewer for OFFA. Should a university or college object to a provisional decision by the Director of Fair Access, the reviewer can be asked to assess the case impartially. He may recommend that there are grounds for the Director to reconsider his decision.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geraint Jones QC was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge before going to the Bar in 1976. He took silk in 2001 and is now recognised as a leading commercial and Chancery practitioner with extensive experience of judicial review work. He has an undoubted reputation for fearless independence and impartiality in upholding the rule of law. He sits as a Recorder and as a part-time Judge of the Tax Tribunal. He is also an arbitrator at the International Court of Arbitration for Sport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that Geraint Jones will be the reviewer for OFFA, his skills and experience, if called upon, will be of great value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The position of statutory reviewer for OFFA has been in place since OFFA was established in 2004. So far there has been no need to call upon the services of the statutory reviewer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the ‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB), published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>A new scheme to send  volunteers into state schools to give inspirational talks about their careers launches today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Jul 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new scheme to send an army of volunteers into state schools to give inspirational talks about their careers has been launched by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deputy Prime Minister was joined by an array of famous faces and people with interesting jobs who are backing the plan, including entrepreneur Karren Brady, actor Joanna Lumley, Glamour magazine editor Jo Elvin, radio presenter Margherita Taylor and head chef at The Ivy restaurant Gary Lee.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone remembers the person who inspired them to follow their chosen career, but independent schools have much stronger links with businesses than schools in the state sector. Research published today by the Education and Employers Taskforce, an independent charity, shows that 80 per cent of independent schools regularly bring external speakers into their schools to boost the career aspirations of their students. 85 per cent involve employers in giving careers advice to students, through Careers Fairs or regular careers talks. Many state schools lack the alumni links to give their students the same opportunities. The ‘Inspiring the Future’ initiative, run by the Education and Employers Taskforce, will play a key role in plugging this gap by connecting inspiring speakers with local schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="link"&gt;Link&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Reforms to Higher Education sector announced</title>

    <summary>The response to the Higher Education White Paper is published today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans to put students at the heart of the system were announced by Ministers today, as they set out their response to the Higher Education White Paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/g/12-890-government-response-students-and-regulatory-framework-higher-education"&gt;Government response to ‘Students at the heart of the system’ and ‘A new regulatory framework for the HE sector’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red-tape barring some smaller specialist institutions from being awarded the title of ‘university’ will be ditched. Previously, institutions needed 4,000 students to become a university, but from today this limit will drop to 1,000 - sweeping away an arbitrary piece of regulation that was preventing excellent institutions using the title. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change will come into effect immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a review into how existing quality assurance arrangements affect alternative providers, including further education colleges offering higher education. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Widening participation statistics released</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New statistical release from ONS</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//analysis/statistics/higher-education/official-statistics-releases/widening-participation-in-higher-education/analysis-of-progression-rates-for-young-people-in-england-by-free-school-meal-receipt"&gt;Widening Participation in Higher Education: Analysis of progression rates for young people in England by free school meal receipt and school type&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New statistics show that a greater proportion of students receiving free school meal went on to university between 2005/06 and 2008/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between the progression rates of those receiving and not receiving free school meals was 18 per cent in 2008/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the statistics, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These figures show how far we have to go to ensure that young people with the ability to go onto Higher Education have the opportunity to do so. While the progress to widen participation at our universities is welcome, more progress is needed - particularly at the most selective institutions. That is why we have expected universities to put more ambitious outreach programmes in place for 2012 - and they will be reviewed annually for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our reforms ensure there are no financial barriers in the way of bright young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds attending university. There are no upfront fees, more financial support while studying, as well as a more generous package of scholarships and fee waivers.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These statistics are being published as part of the social mobility strategy, Opening Doors, Breaking Down Barriers (April 2011), and replace the previous Full-Time Young Participation by Socio-Economic Class (FYPSEC) measure.&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary>New consultation on details of the regulatory system for the future of higher education now open.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIS has launched a consultation on details of the regulatory system for the future of higher education today, following publication of the higher education white paper.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent White Paper Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System (June 2011) set out a commitment to introduce a new, fit-for-purpose regulatory framework to establish the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) as lead regulator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new consultation launched today is a technical consultation, and to be read alongside the White Paper. It informs what changes in procedures, powers and duties will need to be considered, particularly in forthcoming legislation, in order to protect the student interest and provide a high quality experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
