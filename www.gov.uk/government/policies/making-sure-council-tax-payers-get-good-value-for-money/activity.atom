    <title>Council Taxbase 2012 in England</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2008 to 2012 updating those &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/council-taxbase-2011-in-england"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; previously issued on 16 November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="number-of-dwellings"&gt;Number of dwellings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In England there were 22.4 million dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list liable for council tax as at 10 September 2012. This is an increase of 1% compared with 2011 and an increase of 3% compared with 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of dwellings on the valuation list that are exempt from council tax increased by 2% compared with 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35% of all exemptions from council tax are class C (short term vacant dwellings). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 27% of all exemptions are class M or N (student related exemptions). Of these, class M exemptions have increased by more than 48% in the period 2008 to 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of class L exemptions (unoccupied dwellings repossessed by a mortgage lender) again fell between September 2011 and September 2012 to 9,400, the four consecutive annual fall. There are now 6,500 (or 41%) fewer class L exemptions than the peak in 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7.7 million dwellings were entitled to a discount as a result of being occupied by single adults. This represents 33% of all dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2.7 million Band A dwellings (50% of all dwellings liable to Band A council tax) were entitled to a single adults discount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The total number of dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list in England as at 10 September 2012 was 23.2 million, an increase of 143,000, or 1% compared with 2011. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="empty-properties"&gt;Empty properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 2011 and 2012 the number of long-term empty dwellings subject to a discount fell by 28,000 (or 22%). In the same period the number of long-term empty dwellings not subject to a discount increased by 8,000 (or 5%). This gives a net reduction of 20,000, or 7%, in the total number of long term empty dwellings between 2011 and 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of long term empty dwellings that were subject to a discount has fallen by 86,000, or 47%, between 2008 and 2012. In the same period the number of long term empty dwellings that do not receive a discount has increased by 18,000 or 13%. This gives a net reduction of 68,000, or 21%, in the total number of long term empty dwellings between 2008 and 2012. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since the introduction of the New Homes Bonus in the summer of 2010 a large number of authorities have taken the opportunity to review the empty properties and second homes in their area. A number have also altered the level of discount awarded with many abolishing the discount for empty properties altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Eric Pickles acts to limit town hall chiefs' golden goodbyes</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow and costly bureaucracy that requires councils to appoint an independent person, usually a Queen’s Counsel, to review dismissal and disciplinary cases for chief executives is to be changed. The Isles of Scilly Council has recently suspended its chief executive pending one of these investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils seeking to dismiss a chief executive for misconduct or poor performance often pay out inflated lump sums to avoid the cost of taking this bureaucratic route. Eric Pickles intends to remove this expensive roadblock, which does not exist in other parts of government or the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local government estimates the review process can cost between £100,000 and £250,000 in legal fees not counting independent investigation costs and salary for the suspended officer. One case cost £420,000 and took 16 months to adjudicate. Ministers believe decisions by full council ensure proper democratic accountability, without the need for a centrally dictated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post of chief executive is not set in statute, which means there are no central barriers to removing the role. It only takes a simple democratic decision by the council. Several councils have done this in the past year. The statutory head of paid service role can be done by another senior officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles has also today written to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.local.gov.uk/" title="Local Government Association"&gt;Local Government Association&lt;/a&gt; to urge them to take steps to improve their performance management of senior posts. Better management can make it easier and quicker to tackle performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A town hall chief executive costs a lot of money, but if they are simply not up to the job, councillors must be able to get rid of them quick smart without having to throw away thousands in parachute pay-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is ridiculous that councils feel forced to give bumper pay offs to dismiss inadequate chief executives simply to avoid these unnecessary golden goodbye reviews from expensive lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Scrapping this bizarre bureaucratic ritual will save taxpayers money and put the decision firmly back in democratically elected hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act requires councils to publish their pay policies so that local remuneration arrangements - particularly for chief officers - are out in the open and provide value for money for local taxpayers. The associated guidance states councils should vote on pay deals over £100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles announced he intends to toughen up the guidance before councils publish their pay policies for next year. For example, if smaller councils do not pay staff above £100,000 they should consider setting a lower vote threshold. Ministers will reserve the right to regulate should councils not act on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also states that councils should also publicly justify any big bonuses; above inflation pay rises; hiring staff already in receipt of public sector retirement or severance money; and avoid any perceptions of minimising tax payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a public worried about the cost of living and all parts of the public sector looking to make deficit savings, ministers believe these steps will show taxpayers that value for money is being fully considered for top paid staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Baroness Hanham praises Wiltshire Council for saving £85 million on council facilities</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The County Hall refurbishment is part of a major transformation programme that will save £85 million over the next 20 years by rationalising the number of buildings used by the council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the official opening, the minister was taken on a tour of the new office building redesigned to make the best use of office space and the state of the art library, which has already seen over 1,000 visitors in 7 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also at the opening ceremony were Olympic kayak gold medallist, Ed McKeever and Paralympic swimming silver medallists Aaron Morres and Stephanie Milward. Local torchbearers and games makers also attended the community event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Government Minister Baroness Hanham said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the past 2 years I have worked closely with local authorities to encourage them, together with other local public bodies, to have a programme of asset management. Wiltshire Council has made significant progress with this and I am delighted to be able to see their innovative approach today at first hand. This will save Wiltshire’s Council Tax payers at least £85 million. As two-thirds of all public sector assets are owned by councils, if they all followed this example it could potentially save billions of pounds, as well as making better use of public assets and improving services for local residents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>£250 million fund to herald return of better weekly collections</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fund of up to quarter of a billion pounds to help support councils to deliver better, more environmentally friendly weekly bin collections for residents is now open, Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September last year the Government announced its intention to introduce a new weekly collection support scheme for councils that retain or reinstate weekly residual waste and recycling services. The new scheme will deliver benefits to the environment and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers believe that waste services have become too complex, leaving residents anxious about following the rules and possible penalties. They think councils should focus on 3 things: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better weekly collections&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;better contracts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;better use of innovative ideas or technology that help residents to recycle more and do their bit for the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme is additional funding to local government, financed from savings made to the Department for Communities and Local Government’s central budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new fund will help support reward schemes (for example, those like Windsor and Maidenhead’s Recyclebank scheme and Birmingham’s Nectar points scheme), where families are rewarded for recycling, delivering on a Coalition Agreement pledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also explicitly intends to tackle ‘bin blight’ and the proliferation of bins, by supporting new technology where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund will promote innovation, better procurement and joint working across local authorities. It intends to support a range of local initiatives to increase recycling and deliver weekly collections. It will seek to prioritise bids which support comprehensive weekly rubbish and recycling collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rubbish collections are the most visible service that people get for their £120 a month Council Tax bill. But barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik’s cube. The public are fed up of all the bin do’s and bin don’ts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People just want a comprehensive service in return for their Council Tax, which is why this Government is working with councils to increase the frequency and quality of rubbish and recycling collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We want to help people to go green by making it easier for them to do the right thing. This scheme will encourage councils to provide the services we believe residents really want, without sacrificing the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Farrow, the Environmental Services Association’s Director of Policy, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waste management companies want to collect and manage waste in ways which are both user friendly for the householder and benefit the environment. So we welcome the way in which the fund prioritises environmental criteria and services that meet the needs of householders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also support the encouragement given to local authorities to think innovatively and to work with the private sector. We look forward to working with their local authority customers to help them make best use of the opportunities the fund provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Third year of Council Tax freeze announced</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor of the Exchequer has today announced new support for local authorities in England to help them freeze council tax for a further year and assist in keeping those bills down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government will set aside an extra £450 million to help freeze council tax bills in England. The support for local authorities means that taxpayers living in an average Band D home in England could save up to £72 on a five per cent rise in council tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years the Government has provided grants of around £2billion to help freeze council tax. A freeze in council tax in 2013-14 would represent a real terms cut of around two per cent and a fall of nine per cent in real terms over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Coalition Government’s council tax freeze has cut council tax in real terms over the last two years. A third-year’s freeze will mean the combined effect is potentially worth over £200 to Band D residents. Freezing bills again will really help hard working families and those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners with their cost of living.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £450million will be made available, through a new grant scheme, to local authorities who decide to freeze or reduce their council tax next year. If they do, councils, police and fire authorities will stand to receive £225million of funding in both financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15, equivalent to raising their 2012-13 council tax by one per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in 2013-14 the Government will propose to lower the local authority tax referendum threshold to two per cent. This would mean if a local authority seeks to raise its relevant basic amount of council tax by more than two per cent, local people would have the right to keep council tax bills down through a binding referendum veto. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will formally set out the detail on this in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-for-editors"&gt;Notes for Editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A freeze in council tax this year will save families £72 compared to a five per cent rise, on top of the savings already made in 2011-12 and 2012-13. A freeze in 2013-14 represents a real terms cut of around two per cent, compared to latest inflation forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government will shortly write to all English local authorities with full details of the scheme, including providing an indicative breakdown of estimated grants to help local authorities with budget planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The detail on the tax referendum thresholds will be formally set out by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government alongside the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement in December. The House of Commons will be asked to endorse the threshold levels before councils set their annual budgets in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The council tax freeze offer will apply separately to each billing and major precepting authority in England (rather than to each council tax bill issued). Billing authorities include shire districts, metropolitan districts, London Boroughs and unitary authorities and major precepting authorities include county councils, fire and rescue authorities, police authorities and the Greater London Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If an authority sets its basic amount of council tax (i.e. its Band D council tax) in 2013-14 at a level which is no more than its basic amount of council tax in 2012-13, it will receive a grant equivalent to a one per cent increase on the 2012-13 figure in both financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15. Police, Crime Commissioners and fire authorities will also receive a grant equivalent to one per cent of their 2012-13 basic amount of council tax.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unringfenced grant in support of the scheme will be paid to each eligible billing and major precepting authority based on the formula. Payments to authorities will be made through the grant-making powers in section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local authorities who wish to reduce their council tax in absolute cash terms are still also eligible to receive the grant. Local authorities who choose to increase their council tax will not be eligible for the grant scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the Spending Review we have made available £1975million of funding to local authorities to freeze their council tax in 2011-12 and again in 2012-13. In 2011-12 every local authority in England took up the scheme, and council tax in England was frozen. In 2012-13 Government offered to help local authorities in England freeze their council tax again and 85 per cent of local authorities accepted. This limited increases in council tax across England to 0.3 per cent, the lowest increase since council tax was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average Band D council tax and percentage change between 1993-94 and 2012-13 are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devolved Administrations will receive £43million of Barnett consequentials in both 2013-14 and 2014-15.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Technical reforms to Council Tax: when dwellings should not be liable to the empty homes premium</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Finance Bill includes provisions that will allow a billing authority to charge an empty homes premium to provide a stronger incentive to get homes back into productive use and remove the blight of such properties on local neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium was subject to a consultation, ‘Technical Reforms to Council Tax’, which ended on 29 December 2011. The government published its response on 28 May 2012, which confirmed its intention to proceed with the premium and stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will not be payable until a dwelling has been empty and unfurnished for 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the maximum premium that an authority will be able to charge will be 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on the government’s proposals on exceptions to the premium: dwellings which may otherwise be liable for the premium, but which are subject to circumstances that mean that it would not be appropriate for it to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Town halls must tackle £1 billion Council Tax Benefit fraud and error through localisation</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local authorities must get to grips with the £200m of Council Tax Benefit lost each year through fraud and error so they can fully support hard working families and genuinely vulnerable people, Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending on council tax benefit has more than doubled since 1997. Figures revealled today show that since 2006 council tax benefit fraud and error has cost the taxpayer an estimated £1.1bn, an average of around £3m per council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welfare reform is an important part of the Government’s strategy to repair the national deficit. Giving councils a stake in providing council tax support will assist local job creation, promote enterprise and reduce welfare dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government reforms will localise council tax support putting councils, who already raise and collect the tax, in charge of the discount. This will give councils a stronger incentive to support local firms, cut fraud, promote local enterprise, end the something for nothing culture and get people into work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that deficit reduction strategy councils will be expected to save over £400m a year when they begin running local council tax support schemes next year. Councils will keep all savings they can make from reducing fraud and error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1997 and 2010 council tax bills more than doubled. The Coalition Government has worked with councils to freeze council tax for two years, cutting council tax in real terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is not right that over a billion pounds of taxpayers’ money has been lost through council tax benefit fraud and error when there are hard working families and genuinely vulnerable people out there who deserve help with their cost of living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Today’s figures show that when councils take over the benefit with their local schemes there is lots of money to claw back from wasteful mistakes and fraudsters cheating the system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Town halls are already the ones who set and collect council tax so it makes senses that they are the ones who give out the support too. Our reforms will restore the confidence of hard-working taxpayers that the benefits bill is under control and that work pays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Local Government Finance Bill was introduced in December 2011 and paves the way for the implementation of localised council tax support schemes in England from April 2013. Royal Assent is expected later this year. The Bill will see council tax support determined by local authorities. This will give local authorities the flexibility to design schemes which reflect local priorities, giving them a greater financial stake in the economic future of their area and enabling them to deliver a saving of 10 per cent on the current council tax benefit expenditure bill.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Council tax bills were £1,439 on the average Band D property in England in 2010-11, an increase of 109 per cent - or an extra £751 a year on a Band D home. The Coalition Government has worked with councils to freeze council tax for two years - cutting council tax in real terms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Council tax benefit expenditure in England increased from £2.0 billion to £4.3 billion from 1997-98 to 2010-11 (DCLG, &lt;em&gt;Local Government Finance Bill: Localising support for council tax - Updated Impact Assessment&lt;/em&gt;, p.5, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/lgfblocalisingcounciltax"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/lgfblocalisingcounciltax&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Collection rates for Council Tax and non-domestic rates in England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the collection rates for council tax and national non-domestic rates in England in 2011-12 were announced on 27 June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2007-08 to 2011-12 and updates those statistics previously released on 29 June 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local authorities in England collected £22.1 billion in council taxes by the end of March 2012 out of a total of £22.7 billion collectable. This gave a national average in-year collection rate for council tax in England of 97.3 per cent in 2011-12, no change over 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities in England collected £20.8 billion in non-domestic rates by the end of March 2012 out of a total of £21.3 billion collectable. This gave a national average in-year collection rate for non-domestic rates in England of 97.8 per cent in 2011-12, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points over 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over the last four years, the national collection rate for council tax has increased by 0.2 of a percentage point. In the same period the national collection rate for national non-domestic rates has fallen by 1.0 percentage points.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average collection rate of non-domestic rates fell in all regions in the period 2007-08 to 2011-12; the largest fall, 1.9 percentage points, occurred in the North West.&lt;/li&gt;
