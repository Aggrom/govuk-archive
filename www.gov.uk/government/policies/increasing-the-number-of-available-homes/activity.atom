    <title>Communities to receive cash boost for choosing development</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Planning Minister Nick Boles announces new cash incentives.
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities that tackle the legacy of inadequate house-building and choose to accept new housing will benefit directly from new generous cash incentives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighbourhoods that take a proactive approach by drawing up a neighbourhood development plan, and securing the consent of local people in a referendum, will receive 25% of the revenues from the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/community-infrastructure-levy"&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy&lt;/a&gt; arising from the development that they choose to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cash boost will be paid directly to parish and town councils and can be used to back the community’s priorities for example to re-roof a village hall, refurbish a municipal pool or take over a community pub. Neighbourhoods without a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/neighbourhood-planning"&gt;neighbourhood development plan&lt;/a&gt; but where the levy is still charged will still receive a capped 15% share of the levy revenue arising from development in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities without a parish or town council will still benefit from this incentive, with the local planning authority retaining it and spending it in accordance with the wishes of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of hectoring people and forcing development on communities, the government believes that we need to persuade communities that development is in everyone’s interest. Incentives are key to getting the homes built that we both need for today and for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital this country increases the number of homes it builds to meet the needs of its increasing population. The failure of previous administrations to build enough homes, latterly despite the credit boom, led to a severe housing shortage that has been made worse by the rapid increase in the number of households. The number of people living alone has rocketed, and immigration has led to an influx of 1.7 million people into England in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to tackle this housing shortage and make best use of what we already have the government has invested £160 million to deal with the 250,000 homes empty for more than 6 months - 50,000 fewer then in 2009. This money combined with a share of £300 million announced in September’s housing growth package, will help put more than 15,000 empty homes back into use by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has also made clear that planning should encourage the effective use of land, including brownfield land that is not of high environmental value. The majority of all new homes - 76% of those completed in 2010 - were built on brownfield land. But this will not be enough and some undeveloped land will need to be made available for house-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a simple choice.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can decide to ignore the misery of young families forced to grow up in tiny flats with no outside space. We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally and build beautiful places like we used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This government is determined to persuade communities to accept more house-building by giving them a tangible share of the benefits it brings. By undertaking a neighbourhood plan that makes space for new development, communities can secure revenues to make the community more attractive for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neighbourhood planning is an important way to make sure that development has the backing of the community. It is right that the areas that have organised themselves to bring forward a neighbourhood plan and have taken the plan through all the stages of the neighbourhood planning (including a successful examination and referendum) should be rewarded for their positive, pro-active approach to delivering growth. This is why they are entitled to an extra 10% of the levy arising from development in their area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Community Infrastructure Levy amount passed to neighbourhoods reflects the rates the local planning authority set for the levy. These charge a rate or different rates for development in the local area in pounds per square metre. The neighbourhood funding element will be calculated based on the levy receipts from the relevant development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The levy’s charges will become due from the date that a chargeable development is commenced. The neighbourhood funding element will be passed to parish or community councils in accordance with a timetable agreed between the local planning authority and the local council.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where the money is transferred to a parish council (in England) or a community council (in Wales) they will decide how the money will be spent - although they will be expected to work with the local planning authority. Where the money stays with the local planning authority (in areas without a parish or community council) the local planning authority will engage with the communities where the development has happened to agree how best to spend this money.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In areas that have not been subject to neighbourhood planning there will be a cap of £100 per council tax dwelling on the neighbourhood funds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We aim to have these incentives in place from Spring 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We previously &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/community-infrastructure-levy"&gt;consulted&lt;/a&gt; on allowing councils the choice whether to spend their levy receipts on affordable housing but given other ongoing policies to support housing, we are not proposing to make this change at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also going to enable a mayoral development corporation to impose a Community Infrastructure Levy charge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Housing the next generation</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by Planning Minister Nick Boles at an event hosted by Policy Exchange.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This version of the speech excludes party political content].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last September, the Prime Minister declared that our mission is “to build an ‘aspiration nation’”, in which we “get behind people who want to get on in life.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s what’s always made our hearts beat faster,” he said. “It’s not just an economic mission” - but “a moral one” too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to that speech as one of David Cameron’s newest and most junior ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, though I find the Prime Minister’s message inspiring, implicit in it was a challenge that keeps me awake at night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No aspiration is more deeply embedded in the British psyche than the desire to own your own home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the prospect of doing so has been slipping ever further out of the reach of millions of hard-working people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a result of our decades-long failure to build enough houses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the root cause of that is our decades-long refusal to release enough land for development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other problems affecting the housing market in the short term: most of all, the lack of finance for buyers and developers since the credit crunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These the government is already tackling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-people-to-buy-a-home/supporting-pages/help-for-first-time-buyers"&gt;FirstBuy&lt;/a&gt;, which helps reduce the deposit first-time buyers need to find to just 5% of the price of their new home, will invest £460 million, matched by housebuilders, to help 27,000 people by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/newbuy-guarantee-scheme"&gt;NewBuy&lt;/a&gt; enables other households to access 95% mortgages for new build homes, and the Prime Minister announced on Monday that we will bring forward further measures to increase the availability of affordable mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my colleague, Mark Prisk, is deploying £570 million in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/get-britain-building"&gt;Get Britain Building fund&lt;/a&gt; to get building going on sites that already have planning permission, and using the £225 million fund that the Deputy Prime Minister announced to accelerate the delivery of housing on large sites like Cranbrook in Devon and Ebbsfleet in Kent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in the long term, the original source of our housing crisis is the failure of past governments to provide enough land for development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As planning minister, it is my job to persuade local authorities to make more land available so that more homes can be built and the price of new homes comes down - and thereby reverse the trend that has been heading in the wrong direction for decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now can you understand why I sleep a little uneasily?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2011 census revealed that, in the ‘noughties’, home ownership in England fell, for the first time in 60 years: from 68% to 63%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because houses became too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homelessness charity, Shelter, has shown that if the price of food had risen as fast as the price of housing in the last 30 years, a supermarket chicken would now cost £47 - and a jar of instant coffee would cost £20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, the average person setting aside 5% of their income each week could save up for a deposit on a house after 8 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it would take the same person 47 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say that this trend is inevitable, given a growing population, rising incomes and a finite supply of land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Germany real house prices have remained constant since 2000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the Netherlands, which has shared the UK’s rapid growth in population, real house prices rose by a little bit more than a fifth in the same decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did they nearly double in the UK? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve built too few houses to keep up with the rapid increase in the number of households needing a place to live, especially the dizzying increase in the number of people living on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for this growth in the number of households. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some we should celebrate - like the fact that people are living longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others we should regret - like the high rate of divorce or the immigration policies that led to a net influx of 1.7 million people into England in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of these changes have happened and all of the people concerned have the right to a decent home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Shelter estimated that we would need to build 240,000 new homes a year in England to cater for all of these new households. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2012, Alan Holmans from the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research updated these estimates using my department’s publication of new projections of the number of households. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He concluded, that, to keep pace with this trend, we now need to build 270,000 new homes a year, leading to a net increase of 250,000 a year as 20,000 of them would replace existing homes that have to be demolished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether Mr Holman’s projections will prove accurate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do know that the house-building that took place during the ‘noughties’ fell woefully short of what was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a decade of easy credit and an explicit target to build 213,000 new homes a year in England, an annual average of only 147,000 new homes were completed between 2000 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same period the population went up by 3.4 million and, from 1998 to 2008, the number of households went up by 1.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, in each year of the ‘noughties’, the Netherlands built over 4.4 new homes for every 1,000 inhabitants and the French built over 5.6 for every 1,000 inhabitants. In England, we built just 2.9. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in spite the fact that, between 2000 and 2010, total mortgage debt in the UK more than doubled - from £500 billion to £1.2 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because this debt just fuelled a massive boom in prices - and did little to boost the supply of new homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those homes that were built got smaller and smaller, as land prices went up and up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2003 the new houses we built in England were smaller than the ones we’ve already got - and 30% smaller than the new houses being built in the Netherlands, a country that is more densely populated than ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For housing, as in so many areas of our national life, the ‘noughties’ were a wasted decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loads of money sloshing around, lots of top-down targets, but very little to show for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have to build even more houses to make up the ground lost and to keep pace with future growth in the number of households needing homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s assuming we continue to tighten our grip on immigration so that net migration falls below 100,000 a year by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I do really understand why the idea of a lot more house-building makes people nervous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I certainly don’t want to see more open land developed than is absolutely necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately there is no painless way to make homes affordable for working people earning ordinary wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about all the empty homes?” people ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they are certainly right to suggest that we should make full use of our &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/empty-homes"&gt;existing housing stock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most empty homes are only empty for short periods while they change hands or are renovated or are caught up in probate after the last owner’s death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are around 259,000 houses that have been empty for more than 6 months, 50,000 fewer than in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has already invested £160 million and that, together with a share of the £300 million additional spending announced in September’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-boost-british-housebuilding-jobs-and-the-economy"&gt;Housing Growth Package&lt;/a&gt;, should help put over 15,000 empty properties back into use by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to see good homes standing empty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they can’t make more than a marginal contribution to the hundreds of thousands of new homes that we need every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about all the brownfield land?” people then ask - and they point to the Campaign to Protect Rural England (&lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt;) estimate that England has enough brownfield land to support 1.5 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all want to maximise the number of homes we build on previously developed land - not least because such land tends to benefit from existing links to our road and rail networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; admitted that we would only get 450,000 new homes out of brownfield sites in those parts of the country where most of the new homes are needed - London, the South East and the South West. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And achieving that number would require us to build on every scrap of brownfield land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that we are already building most new homes on brownfield land: 76% of all the homes completed in 2010 as against 56% in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simply can’t squeeze much more out of brownfield sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To restrict new house-building to brownfield land would leave us a long way short of the number of new homes we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So “what about the developers’ land banks?” people then ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, I do understand why it riles people that their local councils have to find new sites for development, when the major house-builders are sitting on land with permission to build hundreds of thousands of new homes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m afraid this concern is also misplaced, resting on a misunderstanding about how the British house-building industry works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of September 2012, on sites of 10 or more units, there were 487,000 units with detailed planning permission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 246,000 of them were on sites where no building has even started - and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/growthandinfrastructure.html"&gt;Growth and Infrastructure Bill&lt;/a&gt; that I am taking through Parliament with colleagues will make it easier for developers to renegotiate the unaffordable Section 106 agreements that have made many of these schemes unviable and caused them to stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most sites with planning permission are for schemes of 150 units or more which developers generally build out over 3 to 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are going to have any prospect of getting our current house-builders to build the number of new homes we need, we need them to have a pipeline of sites representing 3 to 5 years’ supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s over a million units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with developers’ land banks is not that they exist - but that they are currently much too small to feed the level of house-building that we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am afraid that we have a simple choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can decide to ignore the misery of young families forced to grow up in tiny flats with no outside space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can turn a blind eye while the dream of a property-owning democracy shrivels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th Century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t believe that anyone really wants to go down that road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we believe in anything, we believe in the power of home ownership to motivate people to work hard, raise strong families and build healthy communities, to put down roots, take responsibility for their surroundings and look out for their neighbours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As David Cameron said, “We get behind people who want to get on in life, the young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to resolve that we will make these decisions locally, and that we will build beautiful places like we used to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way England can remain the green and pleasant land we all love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start from a good position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, contrary to media myth, we’ve got plenty of undistinguished, undeveloped land to spare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By overlaying satellite imagery onto Ordnance Survey maps, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology’s 2007 Land Cover Map shows that 8.9% of England is built up or developed as gardens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that over 90% is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty together account for around 30% - more than 3 times the amount that is built on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we include the green belts that stop our cities sprawling without limit then that goes up to around 40% of England is protected from development - more than 4 times the area that is built on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are ancient woodlands and other irreplaceable habitats which are protected by the National Planning Policy Framework, and other important sites which lie outside the official designations, that are rightly championed by organisations like the &lt;abbr title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds"&gt;RSPB&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Woodland Trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is high quality agricultural land which all of us want to see used for the essential purpose of growing food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are much loved open spaces in villages and towns, which local people understandably want to keep intact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing that I have said and nothing that this government has done will undermine the protection of National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or stop good agricultural land being used for farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or prevent councils from identifying ancient woodland and green spaces that local people want them to protect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And nothing that I have said and nothing that this government has done involves telling communities how many new houses they should accept or where they should be built. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional top-down housing targets caused enormous resentment and as we have seen failed to deliver the goods - house-building has fallen to its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have already revoked the regional strategy for the East of England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, having considered the responses to the consultation on the environmental report, I can announce today that I have decided to revoke the equivalent edict for Yorkshire and the Humber while saving the policies to protect York’s green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be making decisions about the other regional strategies in due course, once the consultations on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/strategic-environmental-assessments"&gt;other environmental reports&lt;/a&gt; have closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the localism that Eric Pickles has unleashed is not and never has been a one-way street. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he has always said, with power comes responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively/supporting-pages/national-planning-policy-framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; spells it out very clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they draw up their local plans, councils must assess their local housing need in an objective way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they must identify immediately developable sites sufficient to supply all of the new homes that are needed over the next 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, many councils are embracing this duty with energy and imagination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some are dragging their feet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a few are looking for ways to evade their responsibilities - or slough them off onto their neighbours because the politics of house-building is just too difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that is not acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils which do not produce credible plans to meet local housing need will find that the presumption in favour of sustainable development will trump local decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they will have to explain to local residents why their failure to produce a robust local plan exposed their communities to speculative development in places where it is not welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not defend and the government will not support those local councils who abdicate their responsibility to meet their fair share of our common housing needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to pretend that it will be easy for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillors will have to find a way to persuade the people who elect them that substantial further house-building is in the interest of the whole community, including those who are living there now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are giving them the tools they need to go about this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that people want is input into the plans for development in their neighbourhood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not just perfunctory consultation that is acknowledged but then ignored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But real involvement and a vote on the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why we’ve created the option of a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/neighbourhood-planning"&gt;neighbourhood plan&lt;/a&gt;, which is drawn up by representatives of a defined community and subject to a referendum of all their neighbours, before it can be adopted and form part of the statutory plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;300 localities are already pursuing a neighbourhood plan - from Thame in South Oxfordshire to St James’ ward in central Exeter to central Milton Keynes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailblazer is Upper Eden in Cumbria, where I was on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their neighbourhood plan will be the first to be put to the test in a local referendum in March of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing people want, aside from local input and local control, is a share in the benefits that new development can bring, whether that takes the form of a boost in the local authority’s tax revenues or an investment in new community facilities or better infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why we’ve introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/new-homes-bonus"&gt;New Homes Bonus&lt;/a&gt; that gives local councils over £8,000 over 6 years for every new Council Tax Band D home that gets built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils received £430 million in New Homes Bonus in 2012 to 2013 and are provisionally set to receive £660 million in 2013 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need incentives, as Policy Exchange has pointed out, that are even more local - so that the people who have to live with new housing developments get a direct benefit from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I am pleased to be able to announce that in areas that charge the new &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/community-infrastructure-levy"&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhoods which accept new development will get 15% of the revenues from the Levy (up to a maximum of £100 per existing household).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because I believe, and this government believes, that neighbourhood plans are the key to unlocking more house-building, those communities that draw up a neighbourhood plan and have it approved by local people in a referendum will receive 25% of these revenues with no upper limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to re-roof your village hall, build a permanent home for your community shop, refurbish the municipal swimming pool, implement a new landscape design in your local park or save your local pub, look no further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump on the bandwagon and get yourself a neighbourhood plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government believes in localism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that if you give people power, they will use it responsibly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you explain to them what their community and their country needs, they will do their bit to make sure it is provided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you give them a stake in a future in which beautifully designed homes with easy access to green space are, once again affordable for working people on ordinary wages, they will do what it takes to bring that future about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perch on the lower branches at the Department for Communities and Local Government, I look around the great wood that is the British government and I see other ministers battering away at the barriers that hold people back with gusto and grit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iain Duncan Smith reforming the benefits system to ensure that work always pays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Gove giving schools control over their own destinies while ramping up expectations of the standards that they will achieve for their students. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are an inspiration and a goad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inspiration because they are ministers who have identified a shocking injustice in the way our society works and are fearless in their determination to “spread the privilege” of a good education and a decent job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A goad because we are more than half way through this Parliament, and it’s now up to me to make sure that our reformed planning system provides enough land to build the houses that England’s next generation so desperately needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it does, I’m sure I will have no problem sleeping at nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Mark Prisk: £200 million Build to Rent fund will boost housebuilding</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A new £200 million fund will boost the construction of new homes specifically for private rent, Housing Minister Mark Prisk said today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Build to Rent fund aims to cut the risk for developers more traditionally used to building homes for sale who are looking to branch out into building homes for private rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By financing the construction of rental homes until they are built, let out and managed, the fund will give developers the freedom to build homes specifically for that market with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management companies will have the chance to invest in these new rental developments, and developers will then repay the investment from government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching the new fund, the Housing Minister described it as yet another step to support housebuilding which will help boost the economy, create jobs and strengthen the housing market by providing people with a broader housing choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="reviving-the-rental-market"&gt;Reviving the rental market&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said that Build to Rent follows recommendations contained in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-rented-homes-review-of-the-barriers-to-institutional-investment" title="Private rented homes: review of the barriers to institutional investment"&gt;Montague report&lt;/a&gt; into rented homes earlier this year and will help address the varying level of quality across the nation’s private rented sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of private rental landlords are small-scale, individual investors. This fund will redress the balance, by stimulating the market in private rented homes for large-scale housing organisations that will in turn help set a new benchmark for landlords across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kickstart this new, larger scale market for privately rented homes, the minister said that Build to Rent will fund ‘demonstration’ projects to show how it might work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert taskforce will also work to boost investor awareness of the fund and offer practical support to those interested in this new market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A healthy rental housing market must have a broad range of choice across the board. But for it to grow and develop, we must first attract new investors. The Build to Rent fund will support this, helping to build homes specifically for private rent and breathing new life into the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And by driving this market in housebuilding, the fund will also help create new jobs, build the homes that families need and local people want, and support economic growth across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayor of London Boris Johnson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The private rented sector now houses a quarter of Londoners and has the potential to support the delivery of a huge number of new homes in the future. I welcome this funding and I will continue to make the case that investment in London’s housing infrastructure is one of the best ways to deliver much needed construction jobs and economic growth now, while at the same time laying the foundations for our economic growth for years to come.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greater London Authority will lead on assessing the expressions of interest for sites in London. Shortlisting decisions will be made by DCLG, the Homes and Communities Agency and the Greater London Authority. The Homes and Communities Agency will undertake due diligence, contracting and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The £200 million Build to Rent Fund is now open for bids, and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/private-rented-sector" title="Build to Rent Fund prospectus"&gt;prospectus&lt;/a&gt; has been published on the HCA website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fund has been developed to support purpose built, private rented demonstration schemes across England which have the potential to attract investors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <summary>Over the next 20 years, more than 20,000 new homes will be built at Ebbsfleet, Kent, with builders on site as early as summer 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 29 August, the Department for Communities and Local Government announced a support package to unlock 22,600 new homes at Ebbsfleet, Kent over the next 20 years. Developers, Land Securities, have invested over £100 million in developing the site. However, plans have been delayed amid concerns over the cost and the need for further investment in transport improvements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kent County Council and Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils worked closely with the department, and with Department for Transport and the Highways Agency to reduce costs of the transport programme and to agree how funding could be unlocked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, builders could be on site as early as summer 2013 with the first homes set to be completed by December 2013. The first phase of 1,500 homes at Eastern Quarry is expected to be completed by 2020, with a further 3,000 homes ready by 2030 to 2031. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern Quarry forms part of longer term plans which are expected to unlock the development of 22,600 homes and around 1 million metres squared of commercial development across the Kent Thameside region over the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>The new Cranbrook community in East Devon, has the capacity to deliver 6,000 new homes between 2012 to 2026.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Cranbrook community in East Devon, has the capacity to deliver some 6,000 new homes over the period 2012 to 2026. Almost a third of all housing required in the wider Exeter area is directly dependent on the successful delivery of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 of the development is already underway, funded by a £12 million repayable grant from a revolving infrastructure fund managed by the Homes and Communities Agency and being repaid on a roof tax basis. Using this funding the developer (the Cranbrook New Community Consortium) can build 1,120 homes by 2015, along with building the main access route into Cranbrook, the Clyst Honiton Bypass and a primary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investment"&gt;Investment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government investment of £20 million will provide: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£10 million for a new secondary school&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£4 million for a second primary school&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£6 million for infrastructure and services to create a new high street for the town centre and commercial areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment will ensure continuity of the scheme, securing the delivery of phase 2, while putting in place the capacity for up to 6,000 homes on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government’s investment, subject to due diligence, will directly unlock phase 2 and provide the infrastructure and school facilities that will give local partners the confidence to build an additional 2,380 homes by 2019.  It will also enable the developer to put in place enough infrastructure to support 6,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the housing, government investment will help create the confidence to bring forward the new town centre and support the realisation of the full ambition for the scheme. It will also provide employment (1,500 jobs) and retail space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Get Britain Building: Bath Riverside</title>
    <category>Case study</category>
    <summary>On the banks of the River Avon, the regeneration of Bath Riverside will transform Bath's western river front into a residential quarter.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set on the banks of the River Avon, the regeneration of this site has started to transform Bath’s western river front into a modern residential quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crest Nicholson is creating a vibrant new community of more than 2,000 homes, with some available for private sale, through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/affordable-home-ownership-schemes/first-buy-equity-loans"&gt;FirstBuy&lt;/a&gt; equity loan scheme, and for rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="getting-on-the-ladder"&gt;Getting on the ladder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FirstBuy initiative helps first time buyers get a foot on the property ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FirstBuy is jointly funded by developers and the government, and works by enabling buyers to own their own home by only paying 80% of the purchase price. At Bath Riverside a 20% top up loan is offered by Crest Nicholson and the government, and buyers need a deposit of just 5% of the purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Cocks, 25, had nearly given up hope of buying his own home until he became aware of FirstBuy on the properties already completed at Crest Nicholson’s Bath Riverside development. He has now moved in to his 1-bedroom apartment at the scheme and is relishing his new-found independence and the security of home ownership in Bath’s newest community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was living with my parents in Bradford-on-Avon but I have a 4 year old son who stays with me every other weekend, so that wasn’t an ideal situation”, explains Ben, who works in higher education. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had been renting previously, but it was impossible to save for a deposit while paying rent. I heard about the FirstBuy scheme after reading about it in the local press late last year, and noticed that it was available at Bath Riverside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without the FirstBuy scheme I would have found it pretty much impossible to get on the housing ladder,” said Ben. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="unlocking-development"&gt;Unlocking development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is also supporting developers with access to much needed finance through the Get Britain Building programme. Up to 16,000 homes on stalled sites across England will be built by March 2015 thanks to this programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second construction phase of 240 homes is currently underway, which has been supported by £2.8 million of investment from the Get Britain Building programme. A recoverable investment, the programme helps developers access finance, and to help bring forward marginal sites by sharing risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is run by the Homes and Communities Agency (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;). Executive director Colin Molton said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bath Riverside is one of the most important developments in the South West, and I am pleased that we’ve been able to help keep Bath building and create quality new homes and safeguard jobs in the area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A biomass central energy system, 2 new public parks, bike storage and easy access to the city centre along the towpaths, and brown and green roofs demonstrate the developer’s commitment to sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the support provided through Get Britain Building, the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; also invested around £2 million in vital infrastructure work which unlocked the first phase of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Get Britain Building: Carlisle Park</title>
    <category>Case study</category>
    <summary>Nearly 400 homes are set to be built on the site of a former tar distillery thanks to Gleeson Homes and HCA investment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new community of nearly 400 homes is set to be built on the site of a former tar distillery thanks to Gleeson Homes and investment from the Homes and Communities Agency (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Croda Tar Distillery, on the border between Kilnhurst and Swinton, closed in the early 1990s. Over the past 2 decades the 31 acre site has lain derelict with the heavily contaminated site proving a challenge for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in 2010 Gleeson identified the site, which is adjacent to the Sheffield &amp;amp; South Yorkshire Navigation Canal, as having great potential for new low cost homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with Rotherham Borough Council and remediation specialists, work is now underway to clean up the site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the clean-up has been completed Gleeson Homes will begin to transform the area into 381 new 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes.  The developer will be making use of £2.2 million of investment from the Homes and Communities Agency’s (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) Get Britain Building programme to start the first phase of 125 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craig Johns, Area Manager at the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The development at Carlisle Park offers a real choice of quality homes to local residents where they want to live at a price they can afford. Our investment will ensure that a local firm will provide these homes which will help safeguard jobs in South Yorkshire.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development will feature a mix of first time buyer and family homes, set among public open space and children’s play areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Gamble, Gleeson Homes Group Land Director said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted that Carlisle Park is part of the Get Britain Building programme. The programme will help us to deliver the first tranche of 125 new homes which are built and priced to suit local people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The project will also have a positive effect of the wider community with the creation of new jobs, apprenticeship opportunities for local young people and investment back into the local area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recoverable investment, the Get Britain Building programme helps developers access finance, and to help bring forward marginal sites by sharing risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 16,000 homes on stalled sites across England will be built by March 2015 thanks to this programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Get Britain Building: Heron's Reach</title>
    <category>Case study</category>
    <summary>The Get Britain Building programme is delivering new homes, safeguarding jobs and contributing to economic growth in Heron's Reach.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficult conditions in the local housing market caused building work at Heron’s Reach, a former mill near Saddleworth Oldham, to stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help get work back on site, family-owned developer Wiggett Homes successfully applied for £1.5 million of development finance from the Get Britain Building programme. Work on the 41 homes began in August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sites with just 15 homes could apply for the recoverable investment to restart their mothballed sites, and the programme was designed particularly to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) get the necessary finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is being managed by the Homes and Communities Agency (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. The programme is expecting to provide between 12,000 and 16,000 homes by March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiggett Homes was the first &lt;abbr title="small and medium-sized business"&gt;SME&lt;/abbr&gt; in England to exchange contracts and restart work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil Wiggett, a chartered surveyor by profession who set up Wiggett Construction in 1979, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Heron’s Reach development stalled some time ago so we’re pleased that the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; is supporting us to deliver these 41 new homes. Work is underway on the next phase of construction which is a major boost to the economic regeneration of the area and will create new jobs and apprenticeships for local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trading has been difficult in these recessionary times and private housing for sale is still slow, but there is the odd green shoot and footfall is improving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Almost at the peak of the boom the company acquired a site at Knoll Mill, Greenfield, Saddleworth, near Oldham. With the land bought at the height of the market, the slow sales and falling house prices meant building work at the site stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now that we have sold the first phase of 16 new homes, and having been successful with Get Britain Building funding, workers are back on site and these new homes will be ready by the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wiggetts has been impressed with how the &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; dealt with the Get Britain Building funding. The people we dealt with had an in-depth knowledge of the industry, were very professional and dealt with our application quickly with the result that we are now back on site.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt; Executive Director for the North West, Deborah McLaughlin added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is great news that work is continuing at this vitally important project, which is delivering much needed high quality new homes and jobs for Oldham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see that the Get Britain Building programme is delivering new homes, safeguarding jobs in our area and contributing to economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Government funding to unlock delivery of 12,000 new homes</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New government support for large housing sites will unlock the delivery of new homes and create thousands of jobs.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intervention will accelerate building on 2 large sites in East Devon and near Milton Keynes; unlocking development and bringing forward construction to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £20 million injection of funding for the new town of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/cranbrook"&gt;Cranbrook&lt;/a&gt;, near Exeter, will enable local partners to bring forward the delivery of new homes included in the local plan, and create 1,500 jobs in the town that will include 6,300 homes and a new rail station with links to London and Exeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money will also unlock construction of a new high street and transport infrastructure needed to develop the town centre, as well as 2 new schools in the next phase of development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Cranbrook, the minister met local construction apprentices who would work on the scheme. He said the government’s investment would create jobs for young people and bring a powerful economic boost to the area, while giving the consortium behind the new town the confidence and resources to drive forward its completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Prisk with construction apprentices" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5640/Mark-Prisk-meets-apprentice.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mark Prisk meets apprentices who will work on the new town at Cranbrook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk also revealed that the construction of 6,000 new homes on the Fairfield development in Milton Keynes will also be brought forward without the need for direct funding, following discussions with the developer behind the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intervention builds on the deal made earlier this year for the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/ebbsfleet"&gt;Eastern Quarry&lt;/a&gt; development near Ebbsfleet in Kent, a site for over 22,000 homes, bringing total number of potential homes unlocked through these schemes to over 34,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the minister also pledged support for housing programmes near Wokingham, where £2.5 million will enable local partners to solve key transport issues in the town in order to unlock the potential for over 10,000 new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said the government is making strong progress to boost house building despite the difficult economic circumstances, and he was in discussions with other schemes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This government is serious about building more homes. That’s why we have been looking carefully at how we can accelerate large, planned housing schemes that already have the support of local people, but need help to move forward in the current economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So I’m delighted that today I can announce our intervention will unlock the delivery of 12,000 new homes, and create thousands of jobs for local people. In the months ahead I will be announcing support for similar schemes. That means more investment, more jobs for our young people and more affordable homes for families across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have set aside considerable funding to assist large housing programmes like Cranbrook, and I would urge anyone with similar proposals to come forward and contact my department.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Devon District Council Leader Councillor Paul Diviani said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a unique opportunity here to create Cranbrook’s town centre as a shining exemplar of how all town centres can function!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Currently the town centre is a blank canvas; we are not restricted by existing buildings or street formations. With support from central government our vision of a town centre that is vibrant, attractive, welcoming, the beating heart of the new community, can become a reality much sooner than previously expected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement is the first allocation of £225 million, earmarked by the Chancellor in last week’s Autumn Statement, for the delivery of 50,000 new homes in large, locally-supported housing programmes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding programme for planned, large-scale sites, administered by the Homes and Communities Agency, will be targeted at schemes that could deliver real benefits to their communities, but are struggling to move forward because the current economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside funding to unlock new construction, the schemes will receive a package of support, including help to facilitate close co-operation with the local council and community during planning and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="progress-on-public-land"&gt;Progress on public land&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said an expert review published today also demonstrates the government is taking the right steps to quickly release its previously-used, surplus land for building new homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the recommendations in the report, led by the chairman of Berkley Group, Tony Pidgley, are already shaping measures being taken forward by the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date enough land has been sold to build up to 33,000 new homes, and last week’s Autumn Statement included a £290 million fund for the Home and Communities Agency to introduce measures that will quickly bring forward new sites for development, such as installing the right infrastructure so the land can be used for building new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony Pidgley, chair of the Expert Advisory Panel said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a golden opportunity to deliver growth and great places. It’s surplus public land. It doesn’t need new legislation. All that’s required is a simple system to dispose of the land, alongside investment in infrastructure, and then the private sector can get on with building these much needed homes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further reaction to the funding support for Cranbrook: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the consortium partners - Hallam Land, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey - Mike Owen, project manager for Cranbrook, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were privileged to give Mark Prisk a tour of the development which gave him an insight into the brand new community being created. From the very start the development of Cranbrook has been about partnership and this announcement of funding support for phase 2 continues that process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without this phase 2 Cranbrook would have been delayed at the end of phase 1. Instead, we have certainty in the delivery of phase 2, we can move ahead now and commit with confidence to the next key stages of the project and delivering further community infrastructure and bringing forward much needed private and affordable homes. The success of Cranbrook to-date has been underwritten by the amenities and infrastructure that we have been able to provide. In turn this has enabled the creation a real community from day one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillor Will Mumford, Chair of Exeter and Heart of Devon Growth Board and cabinet member for Economy, Enterprise and Employment, Devon Council said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that Cranbrook has been recognised for its successful delivery and for the additional funding to enable us to bring phase 2 forward. This keeps the project momentum going, will secure additional jobs and investment and is a resounding vote of confidence in the partnership approach.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Molton, Homes and Communities Agency Executive Director for the South and South West, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The government has shown its commitment to housing and development as a major route to driving economic growth and we welcome the confidence ministers have shown in our ability to deliver its key initiatives, supported by new investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s welcome news also that Cranbrook is rightly identified as a vanguard project which will help drive economic growth in the south west, by providing the essential investment needed to deliver the second phase of the project. This is a huge opportunity, and I know that our partners will grasp it to maximise delivery of new homes and growth in Exeter and East Devon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost to councils and communities through the New Homes Bonus</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The New Homes Bonus scheme pays over £1 billion to councils backing growth.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Council efforts to get Britain building are to be rewarded with a multi-million pound &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/new-homes-bonus" title="New Homes Bonus"&gt;New Homes Bonus&lt;/a&gt;, Housing Minister Mark Prisk announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next year, England’s 353 councils are set to share a cash payout of £661 million, after delivering 142,000 new homes, including 58,000 affordable properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This funding also rewards councils for bringing 13,000 long-term empty properties back into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s provisional allocation, to be paid in the 2013 to 2014 financial year, means councils will have received £1.3 billion through the New Homes Bonus scheme since its launch in April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This total recognises over 400,000 new builds and conversions, and over 50,000 empty properties being brought back into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister argued that the New Homes Bonus had proved critical in ensuring communities see the benefit of housing growth in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For years, developers found themselves at loggerheads with communities unconvinced that their plans for growth would benefit them. But the New Homes Bonus is turning this around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The £1.3 billion paid out to councils to date has meant that now local people are able to see the rewards of new developments in their area - paving the way for thousands of much-needed, locally-supported homes to be delivered across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="getting-britain-building"&gt;Getting Britain building&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils across the country have made the most of this additional funding to directly benefit their local communities. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Tyneside Council, which has allocated some of its New Homes Bonus funding towards a £3.1 million revamp of a library which overlooks a Georgian square in the heart of North Shields. The library scheme forms part of the regeneration of the square, which also includes the refurbishment of properties, bringing it back into residential use for the first time in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warwick Council, which has entered in a 10-year partnership with the Waterloo Housing Group to deliver new affordable homes in the area, with all New Homes Bonus payments generated by additional new homes built recycled back into the scheme to deliver additional housing and bring empty homes back into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uttlesford District Council is allocating some of its New Homes Bonus to fund a hi-tech shelter for teenagers in a new play park at Carver Barracks. Those using the shelter can generate their own power through crank handles located around the room, with the energy generated able to support the use of Bluetooth and MP3 players. The idea for the project came from a committee - The Rowney Community Park Fund - made up of soldiers’ wives.&lt;/p&gt;
