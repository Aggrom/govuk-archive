&lt;p&gt;It includes proposals for tighter carbon dioxide emission standards for new homes and non-domestic buildings, to take the next step towards ‘zero carbon’ standards, plus tighter performance standards for works to existing buildings. The paper also contains proposals to introduce, on a phased basis requirements for additional energy efficiency improvements to be carried out when other specified works (eg extensions) are planned, and Green Deal finance is available as an option to meet the up-front costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building regulations: access statements, security, changing places toilets and regulation 7</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper sets out the detailed proposals on Parts A, B, C, K, M and N, Access Statements, security, Changing Places toilet and Regulation 7, and is Section 1 of 4, relating to the 2012 Building Regulations consultation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 1 provides an overview of the consultation package as a whole as well as proposals on a number of areas including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacing the currently-referenced standards in Part A (Structure) with the new British Standards based on Eurocodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;aligning the existing guidance in Approved Document C (Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture) with the most up-to-date radon maps to ensure the safety provisions are targeted appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarifying the guidance on Access Statements in Approved Document M (Access to and use of buildings)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising the guidance supporting Parts M, K and N (Access, Protection from falling, collision and impact and Glazing respectively) to remove unnecessary costs on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making minor changes to the technical guidance in Approved Document B (Fire safety) to resolve practical problems in the application of Requirement B2 (Internal fire spread (linings))&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the intention to take forward the repeal of the fire protection provisions in the Local Acts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the non-regulatory approach proposed in relation to domestic security and Changing Places toilets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="draft-approved-documents"&gt;Draft Approved Documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published alongside this section of the consultation is a draft version of a new Approved Document K (Protection from falling,collision and impact)(see under Download). Not only does this reflect the proposed changes resulting from the rationalisation of Parts K, M and N, it also seeks consultees’ views on the proposed “new style” of Approved Documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new style has also been applied to a draft revised Approved Document Regulation 7 which can be found in the main consultation document as Annex I.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tighter checks to keep cowboy builders out</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New measures have been put in place to help protect people from cowboy builders Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tradesmen who operate under self check schemes, which allow them to check their own work, will be required to meet higher standards and prove they meet the right levels of quality, giving householders the peace of mind that work on their homes is up to scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures will also ensure that householders have a financial safety net in place such as a guarantee or insurance, to catch them if self-check installers fail to finish work properly or if they can’t be chased through the courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 85,000 complaints are made about building work in homes each year according to the Office of Fair Trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current self-check schemes have conditions in place to keep the cowboys out. Today’s proposals will further protect people from shoddy work and raise the bar for self-check tradesmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations running self-check schemes will now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to be accredited to an international quality standard in order to operate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have to assess that their members’ competence levels and actual work are up to national standards; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be required to promote the membership and use of their schemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Cowboys builders that leave behind a trail of shoddy work costing householders thousands to put right, give the rest of the industry a bad name. We are determined to keep the cowboys from infecting self-check schemes, which let hardworking competent tradesman get on with providing high quality work, quickly and at fair prices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I’m determined to ensure that consumers are properly protected. By raising the bar even higher for self-check tradesman, we are sorting the rogues from the professionals, making it easier for people to identify competent installers and giving them the confidence that they will receive a high quality of work - or be protected if they don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the year to March 2011, Consumer Direct received 70,000 complaints from consumers about general home improvements, maintenance and repairs, and an additional 15,000 specifically about the (window and conservatory) glazing sector. (Source: Home Repairs and Improvements: A Research Report by TNS-BMRB for the Office of Fair Trading, June 2011 &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/othermarketswork/home-repairs/"&gt;www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/othermarketswork/home-repairs/&lt;/a&gt; (external link)).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new conditions of authorisation for Competent Person scheme operators are published today, together with an impact assessment and the summary of responses to consultation: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/competentpersonsschemes/"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/competentpersonsschemes/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also published today is an invitation for applications to be made to the Department for new or extended schemes. Details can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/competentpersonsschemes/howapply/"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/competentpersonsschemes/howapply/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installers of windows and boilers and other tradesmen can be part of Competent Person schemes which allow them to self-check (i.e. self-certify) the compliance of their work with Building Regulations. The self-check system cuts out the need for checking by the local authority or other third parties, allowing quality work to be done quickly and saving the customer money.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall aim of this project was to understand the impact of European fire test and classification standards on building regulations and UK industry, in particular, on wallpapers and similar decorative linings.&lt;/p&gt;
