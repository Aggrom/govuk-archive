    <title>Piracy Ransoms Task Force publishes recommendations</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force was established by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, after the London Conference on Somalia in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14-nation Task Force, brought together policy makers from some of the world’s largest Flag States (countries where vessels are registered), nations whose seafarers are most commonly at risk, and those countries at the forefront of the military response to piracy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force made four recommendations in its final report to the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia in New York:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a new strategic partnership between Flag States, the private sector and law enforcement agencies that brings together those tackling piracy and those subjected to it in a united effort to break the piracy business model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a more co-ordinated approach to information-sharing to provide evidence to pursue and prosecute all involved in piracy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strengthen co-ordination between Flag States, the private sector and military responders to prepare for potential hostage situations; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage implementation of anti-piracy measures, including greater compliance with Best Management Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s conclusions from the Piracy Ransoms Task Force are a welcome step in the right direction. International action, led by the UK, is starting to beat back in the global fight against piracy. The dramatic reduction in pirate activity in the past year shows how important collective action is, and the recommendations of the Task Force should make it harder for pirates to receive, and to profit from, ransom payments. But seafarers of all nations remain at risk, and we must continue to work to break the piracy business model, with the ultimate ambition of bringing an end to ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK Government firmly supports and endorses the conclusions of the Piracy Ransoms Task Force. Only through the international community working together to break the pirates’ business model will we reach a position whereby pirates are no longer able to receive or profit from ransom payments. The Government will continue to work as a leading member of the Contact Group and with industry in taking forward the implementation of the task force’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>HMS Monmouth sharpens skills for the Gulf</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plymouth-based Type 23 frigate and crew of 215 left Plymouth last month and will be policing busy shipping lanes in the Gulf crucial to maritime trade in order to disrupt and deter piracy and other illegal activities at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the ship at a high level of readiness takes a lot of training and hard work, so, during the ship’s transit to the region, the crew have been taking part in a wide variety of physical and military exercises to keep themselves ready for operational duties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A period in the eastern Mediterranean allowed the weapon engineering department to take advantage of a NATO training exercise in Crete and prove the accuracy of all sensors and weapon systems on board. This also allowed the ship’s Royal Navy and Royal Marines boarding teams to participate in multiple boarding exercises with Greek forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dramatic element of the training was ‘fast roping’ down to the ship from a Lynx helicopter operated and maintained by members of the ship’s flight from 815 Naval Air Squadron, who are embarked for the deployment. The warfare department also provided gun shoots and small-arms firings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marine White takes part in a continuation shoot on board HMS Monmouth whilst transiting the Mediterranean en route to the Gulf " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1587/HMS_Monmouth_sharpens_skills_for_the_Gulf2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Marine White takes part in a continuation shoot on board HMS Monmouth whilst transiting the Mediterranean en route to the Gulf [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Ben Shread, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While shooting, fast roping and simulated boarding of small boats took place above deck, the chefs were busy cooking meals for the ship’s company but still found the time to make a replica chocolate version of Nelson’s flagship Victory for the wardroom’s Trafalgar Night dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sailors themselves are also being put through their paces by Leading Physical Trainer Danny Card who has been running boxing circuits and early morning workouts each day to keep them fighting fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Almost 100 per cent of the ship’s company are in date for their standard fitness test and the majority are highly motivated to get fitter during the deployment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high demand for lots of different types of fitness training, with every range of fitness represented taking part in physical exercise on board each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This busy period for the ship’s company supplements the months of operational training they had before leaving the UK - the crew of HMS Monmouth is ready in all respects if called into action in the patrol area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Sutherland's top gunners fend off French top guns</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Devonport-based frigate came under ‘attack’ from a pair of French Mirage jets of 3/11 Course Squadron based in Djibouti during air defence training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At high altitude the Mirages can notch up speeds in excess of 1,500mph (2,400km/h) - more than twice the speed of sound. At low level, they’re limited to a little under 690mph (1,110km/h), whereas Sutherland can get up to 39.5mph flat-out (34 knots or 64km/h) - achieved during speed trials back in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its top low-altitude speed, a Mirage will eat up 1,012 feet (308m) every second - which gives gunners like Able Seaman Herring three seconds to react; the range of the minigun - a Gatling gun which spews out up to 6,000 rounds a minute - is a little over 3,000 feet (914m).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training, known in military parlance as an ADEX (Air Defence Exercise), came about thanks to the personal touch; a couple of French pilots came aboard the frigate when she took a break from her patrols to take on supplies, and thus the seeds were sown for a ‘workout’ which tested airmen and sailors alike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was fantastic training for the entire ship’s company - we practised our core war-fighting skills in the operations room, ship handling from the bridge, and there was battle damage overlaid to test the entire ship’s company,” said Sutherland’s Operations Officer Lieutenant Commander Tom Westwood.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Mirages carried out simulated missile raids and bombing attacks for an hour. Sutherland defeated each incoming raid and manoeuvred aggressively to ensure all her weapons and sensors could engage the targets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Mirage pilots commented on the difficulty they faced attacking the ship due to her manoeuvres and the skill of the ship’s company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will though be back to give it another go; Sutherland intends to repeat the exercise with the French when she’s next in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not merely the gunners aboard the ship who’ve been tested recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short visit to the Omani capital of Muscat, the frigate headed out into the Gulf of Oman to join US forces for a three-day submarine hunt as Sutherland and the Arleigh Burke Class destroyer USS Nitze tried to find an American hunter-killer boat lurking somewhere below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the Devonport-based frigate could call upon the ship’s Merlin, call-sign ‘Warlock’, to track down the ‘foe’; the helicopter is widely acknowledged in naval circles as the best there is at sub-hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Merlin crew, who’ve devoted most of the deployment to maritime security and board and search operations with Sutherland’s Royal Marines Commando detachment, a spot of ‘pinging’ was a welcome return to the helicopter’s raison d’etre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The anti-submarine exercise allowed us to refresh and refine our core and advanced anti-submarine warfare skills in challenging environmental conditions,” said Merlin Flight Commander Lieutenant Earl Kingston.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It was the perfect opportunity for my team to adjust our traditional tactics - normally employed in more temperate climes - to the unique oceanography of this region.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And it allowed us to work closely with our American cousins and make use of their submarine, so we gained an insight into the different tactics they employ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the exercise Sutherland and Nitze conducted a simultaneous fuel replenishment at sea with the aptly-named USNS Supply, an American fast combat support ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sutherland will continue her wide-ranging mission - a combination of keeping the sea lanes open for lawful usage by mariners and working with friendly nations and navies in the region - until the year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Royal Navy helps reduce Somali pirate activity</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Northwood writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Eleven pirates on board with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. All comms on ship are down. Crew safe in engine room and have control of engine and steering. Please help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message was contained in a plastic water bottle thrown into the Indian Ocean by a member of the security team on board the Italian Merchant Vessel Montecristo, which the previous day had been boarded by Somali pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperate times require desperate measures and, in this age of satellites, radar and computers, calling for help via a message in a bottle certainly qualifies as an act of desperation. The security team had attached a strobe light to the bottle, which, fortunately for the 23 Montecristo crew members, was picked up by a US frigate, De Wert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not far from her was our ship, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria, equipped with a Royal Navy helicopter and Royal Marine boarding teams. We were able to answer the master of Montecristo’s plea for help, recapture his ship from the pirates, and return it to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The gunner on HMS Somerset's Merlin helicopter fires shots across the bow of a pirated dhow " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1964/Royal_Navy_helps_reduce_Somali_pirate_activity2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The gunner on HMS Somerset's Merlin helicopter fires shots across the bow of a pirated dhow pi[Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Kyle Heller and LA (Phot) Dave Jenkins, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15 Somalis we detained are now in Italian custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montecristo was lucky; lucky that Fort Victoria could cross 550 miles [885km] of Indian Ocean, the distance from Portsmouth to Edinburgh, before the pirates broke into the crew safe area or ‘citadel’. But she also made her own luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was well prepared for her transit of the Indian Ocean with razor wire defences of her upper decks and superstructure. These at least slowed the pirates down as they boarded the vessel and gave the crew and their unarmed security team time to retreat and barricade themselves into the engine room, and wait for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montecristo incident is the Somali piracy problem and some of its solutions in microcosm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago Somali pirates were a regular feature in the news. The number of attacks on merchant vessels was in double figures each month and the number of vessels held by the Somalis for ransom had increased to more than 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of Somali piracy in 2008 caught people by surprise, and there was a strong sense that nothing could be done to defeat the pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no obvious solution to the problems of Somalia ashore, the huge distances involved made it difficult for military forces to protect merchant vessels effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give some idea of scale, in the four months that Fort Victoria was at sea she operated in an area the size of western Europe, patrolling a front 2,300 miles [3,700km] long - the distance from Berlin to Moscow - and steaming a total of 27,000 miles [43,500km].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something has been done and the past few months have seen a significant reversal of fortunes. Attacks on merchant vessels are down by 80 per cent and today there are only a handful of vessels held captive off the Somali coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most merchant vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden are now employing armed and unarmed security teams, along with other protection measures. Collectively this description of merchant ship self-protection goes by the mundane name of ‘industry best management practice’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these measures work. In most cases they prevent the pirates successfully boarding vessels. This enables the patrolling naval forces to locate the attacking pirate vessels and detain the Somalis for prosecution. All this has served to set back Somali piracy activity to 2007 levels and to reduce their cashflow significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are tactical successes that must be viewed in the context of a much bigger strategic picture. They depend on a far wider network of operations involving politicians, commercial shipping and other agencies. When Fort Victoria recently captured 14 Somali pirates we were able to take them to the Seychelles for prosecution. Thanks to the support of the British High Commissioner to the Seychelles and his strong relations with members of its government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is an even bigger strategic picture. The pressure put on pirates by military success has created headroom for those tackling the more intractable issues of governance ashore in Somalia. This week’s Somalia Conference in London marks the next stage in restoring calm to the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Royal Navy returns pirated dhow to owner</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yemeni fishing dhow, which was recovered from the suspected Somali pirates on Friday 13 January 2012, had been hijacked and held in a known pirate camp ashore. Awadh Barasheed, the owner of the dhow, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am happy to receive my dhow back after being pirated since 18 May 2011. I would like to thank the coalition forces and specifically the British Navy for retrieving my dhow from the hands of the criminal pirates. This dhow is the only source of income for me, my brothers and our families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel embarked on RFA Fort Victoria were able to hand back the dhow in international waters in the Gulf of Aden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Gerry Northwood, Royal Navy, Commander of the UK Counter-Piracy Task Group, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dhow was handed to the captain of Yemeni Navy ship 1031 and the agent acting on behalf of the dhow’s owner. This was an excellent example of the Royal Navy and the Yemeni Navy working together for the common good of the local maritime community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Captain Gerry Northwood presents a plaque to the captain of Yemeni Navy ship 1031 " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1967/Royal_Navy_returns_pirated_dhow_to_owner2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Captain Gerry Northwood presents a plaque to the captain of Yemeni Navy ship 1031 [Picture: LA(Phot) Kyle Heller, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Saleh Bayumain, Chairman of the Dhow Owners Association of Mukalla, passed a message back to the Yemeni Liaison Officer based at Combined Maritime Forces headquarters to express his own appreciation of the Royal Navy, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are happy to see a member of our association is getting back to business. On behalf of all dhow owners of Mukalla I would like to express my gratitude to the commander of the British naval ship and his dedicated and noble crew members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My thanks also extend to all the maritime forces who patrol the area and fight piracy; they have helped us on many occasions and provided help in terms of food, water, fuel and mechanical support. Thanks also to our Navy and Coast Guard who followed up with this issue from the beginning and co-ordinated the delivery of the dhow to its owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008 the Royal Navy has been actively assisting the local maritime community in the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean through international counter-piracy efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NATO-led counter-piracy task force conducts routine visits to local ships, merchant vessels and fishing dhows going about their lawful business in international waters to confirm that they are safe and to reassure them that the international maritime forces are in the area as a force for good, to protect them from pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Northwood added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was pleased that we were able to return the dhow to its rightful owner. It is important that through our co-operation with the Yemeni Navy we reassure the local maritime community that we are able to protect their interests. They are as much the victims of Somali piracy as the larger international ships navigating through the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFA Fort Victoria has been acting as part of a NATO task group in support of Operation OCEAN SHIELD. In the past ten days, five pirate groups have been successfully disrupted in the Gulf of Aden and over fifty pirates are potentially facing the prospect of prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Cumberland continues to support carrier Charles de Gaulle</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most people in Britain were sleeping off the Christmas Day excess, HMS Cumberland led the French carrier group through the vital Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British frigate had been acting in support of Charles de Gaulle in the Indian Ocean while she conducted air operations into Afghanistan over the Christmas period. Cumberland’s duties with the French will continue in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cumberland’s Christmas tasking afforded her crew little opportunity to relax and enjoy the festivities, although, in traditional fashion, roast turkey and all the trimmings was served to the sailors by Cumberland’s Captain and officers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Steve Dainton, Captain of HMS Cumberland, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cumberland’s tasking in support of Charles de Gaulle over Christmas has demonstrated the longstanding and close working relationship between the French Navy and us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Strait of Hormuz is a vital sea lane and Cumberland has been tasked to assist in the provision of security for the French carrier. This is a task we have already provided for other high value shipping since we’ve been on task in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Cumberland (background) and French carrier Charles de Gaulle (foreground) " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1749/HMS_Cumberland_continues_to_support_carrier_Charles_de_Gaulle2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HMS Cumberland (background) and French carrier Charles de Gaulle (foreground) [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumberland is a versatile multi-role frigate, and is as much at home providing support to the carrier as she has been providing a reassuring presence to peaceful maritime use of the Gulf since the beginning of November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She assumed responsibility as the on-watch Gulf frigate from HMS Somerset on 31 October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, she has been employed conducting energy security patrols in the Gulf, ensuring the safety of critical energy supply routes for the UK and her allies. She has also been tasked with the protection of the Al Basra oil platform in Iraqi territorial waters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 80 per cent of Iraq’s GDP is pumped through the terminal and into waiting oil tankers which then pass through the strategically critical Strait of Hormuz. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Cumberland will remain on task in the Gulf until well into the New Year. She is due to return home to Devonport in March prior to decommissioning in the summer as part of savings following the Strategic Defence and Security Review. She sailed from the UK on 30 September 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Royal Marines destroy pirate vessel</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marines, from Plymouth-based frigate HMS Montrose, fired their machine guns at the pirate vessel as they hovered above it in the warship’s Lynx helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident took place during a routine patrol off the Somali coast yesterday, Tuesday 23 November 2010, when the helicopter identified the suspect boat as the whaler from MV Aly Zoulfecar, which had been acting as a pirate ‘mother ship’ since it was hijacked on 3 November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whaler was anchored off a known pirate camp and, once permission had been given to take it out, the Royal Marines marksmen fired their M3M .50-calibre machine guns and destroyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Montrose’s Commanding Officer, Commander Jonathan Lett, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HMS Montrose has been patrolling off the Somali coast for some time and we know how the pirates operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our destruction of the whaler close to a known pirate camp has sent a message to the Somali pirates that NATO and other coalition forces are willing to take the fight to them in order to prevent them from attacking merchant ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Montrose is operating off the Somali coast as part of NATO’s counter-piracy operation, OCEAN SHIELD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
