    <title>HMS Protector takes to the ice for a charity Santa run</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Santas, accompanied by Rudolph, were gathered at 10am for a gentle warm-up led by the Executive Officer, Commander Don Mackinnon, who is currently in command for this Antarctic patrol, before it was ‘on your marks, get set… ho ho ho’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Santa run was conducted on ice in the waters surrounding Deception Island, a dormant, water-filled caldera volcano; one of only two known in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking through a sheet of snow-covered ice before coming to a planned stop, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Patrol-and-Minehunters/Ice-Patrol-and-Survey-Ships/HMS-Protector" title="HMS Protector"&gt;HMS Protector&lt;/a&gt; took position and disembarked her personnel to test the ice conditions and drill ice core samples to ensure the ice was safe, before Protector’s eager Father Christmasses followed via the ship’s accommodation ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid perfect weather conditions, and under the watchful eye of two seals that had taken up post next to the ship, they completed their run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Protector's Father Christmasses on the start line" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5743/protector2g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HMS Protector's Father Christmasses on the start line, ready for the off [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Arron Hoare, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annually, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.each.org.uk/" title="East Anglian Children's Hospice"&gt;East Anglian Children’s Hospice&lt;/a&gt; conducts nine Santa runs across Essex and East Anglia throughout the festive period, raising thousands of pounds for the charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is traditional for Royal Naval ships to adopt a charity from their affiliated town so that they can fundraise whilst away from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the work that HMS Protector conducts in Antarctica, she has formed a close liaison with a number of organisations in the Cambridge area (amongst them the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/" title="British Antarctic Survey"&gt;British Antarctic Survey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/" title="Scott Polar Research Institute"&gt;Scott Polar Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;) and as such is affiliated to the City of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Protector has been affiliated with the East Anglian Children’s Hospice since August 2012. The East Anglian Children’s Hospice provides support to families and care for children and young people with life-threatening conditions across Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rudolph (Able Seaman Scott) Royal Navy" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5744/protector3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rudolph (Able Seaman Scott) gets off to a flying start [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Arron Hoare, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing care and support wherever the family wishes, in families’ own homes, in the community or at the hospices, their care teams help children and their families with the emotional and physical challenges they face, helping them to make the most of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Don Mackinnon stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With 21 hours of daylight in every 24, our working day in Antarctica tends to be a long one. Yesterday for example our first boat group departed the ship at 0830 [8.30am] in the morning and the last one finally got back at 2300 [11pm] that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With that sort of work pace it’s nice to be able to take a break from operations now and again, and do something both for fun, and also to help our affiliated charity at the same time. Father Christmas’s traditional home might be the North Pole… but as you can see, he has helpers that visit the other one too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Protector is currently in the Antarctic in order to support an international team conducting formal &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm" title="The Antarctic Treaty"&gt;Antarctic Treaty&lt;/a&gt; inspections of sites across the Peninsula, whilst maintaining a UK Sovereign presence in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://britishantarcticterritory.fco.gov.uk/en/" title="British Antarctic Territory"&gt;British Antarctic Territory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Protector will be operating in and around Antarctica until April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Sutherland returns in time for Christmas</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ship was greeted by cheering and waving families and friends wearing festive hats and holding banners with loving messages at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Naval-Bases/Devonport" title="HMNB Devonport"&gt;HM Naval Base Devonport&lt;/a&gt; in Plymouth on Saturday 15 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship’s Culdrose-based &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Aircraft/Helicopters/Merlin-MK1" title="Merlin"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; helicopter flight arrived back separately at the Helston air station on Friday 14 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Frigates/HMS-Sutherland" title="HMS Sutherland"&gt;HMS Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; has been busy conducting anti-piracy and terrorism patrols as part of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Operations/Enduring-Operations/Middle-East/Combined-Maritime-Forces" title="Combined Maritime Forces"&gt;Combined Maritime Forces&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring the sea lanes and waters east of Suez and off the Horn of Africa are safe for seafarers to conduct their daily business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship conducted boarding operations on suspect vessels and also reassurance visits to build relationships with mariners and obtain information on pattern of life in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="AS(ME) Dale Plumpton kissing Terri Layden" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5729/Sutherland5g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Able Seaman (Marine Engineering) Dale Plumpton receives a welcome home kiss from Terri Layden [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Vicki Benwell, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crew also exercised with coalition and allied forces in the region to strengthen ties and improve methods of working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Sutherland’s Commanding Officer, Commander Al Wilson, said it was a ‘magic’ time to come home at Christmas. He added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The huge variety and diversity of task that Sutherland has fulfilled whilst on operations illustrates the inherent flexibility of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; in protecting and promoting UK interests worldwide, whether it is preventing piracy or terrorism at sea or strengthening bonds with regional allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, I could not have achieved this without an efficient, capable and highly motivated ship’s company and, as always, I am highly proud of what my team has achieved over the last 6 months whilst remaining cheerful and utterly professional throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My team and myself are now looking forward to spending Christmas at home with our loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Royal Navy personnel on board HMS Sutherland" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5730/Sutherland4g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Petty Officer on board HMS Sutherland waves to the waiting families on the dockside as the ship comes into port [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Vicki Benwell, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Able Rate (Communication Information Specialist) Peter Hodgkin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HMS Sutherland is my first ship and I joined her 3 months prior to deploying on operations. With this being my first deployment and first time away from the UK I was nervous, but excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There have been some tough times, but overall I have really enjoyed it, especially the team spirit of the ship and all the good work that we have achieved on operations. My most memorable moment was helping out at an orphanage in Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having handed over duties to sister ship &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Frigates/HMS-Northumberland" title="HMS Northumberland"&gt;HMS Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; at the end of November, the crew of HMS Sutherland is now looking forward to spending Christmas at home and time with families and friends before a busy 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>VIDEO: HMS Edinburgh sends home festive cheer</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 260 sailors serving on board &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-42-Destroyers/HMS-Edinburgh" title="HMS Edinburgh"&gt;HMS Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; will spend the festive season on board the Portsmouth-based warship while she sails the South Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a bid to spread some Christmas cheer the personnel have donned their smartest Santa outfits and created a video for their loved ones set to The Darkness’ Christmas Time (Don’t Let The Bells End):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEz0dfCrqaI" title="HMS Edinburgh Christmas Video"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video features scenes from around the ship with sailors wearing Santa hats, Christmas cracker outfits and elf costumes waving hello to family and friends from thousands of miles away at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the crew have also made videos to send back to their home towns - the full selection can be seen on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/royalnavyofficial" title="Royal Navy Official YouTube channel"&gt;Royal Navy’s official YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commanding Officer of HMS Edinburgh, Commander Nick Borbone, who will be away from wife Joanne and children Barney, 9, Eddie, 6, and Amy, 5, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It will be strange not being there on Christmas Day and I will miss seeing them, but they have lots of friends and family to keep them entertained and I will call them to see how they are getting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a tough time of year to be away, but I expect there will be a good festive spirit on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of the Royal Navy’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-42-Destroyers" title="Type 42 destroyers"&gt;Type 42 destroyers&lt;/a&gt;, HMS Edinburgh is halfway through a six-month deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks a historic milestone for both the ship and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; as it will be the last time a Type 42 destroyer deploys on operations as they make way for the new-generation &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers" title="Type 45 Destroyers"&gt;Type 45 destroyers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Edinburgh is undertaking a range of tasks across the length of the Atlantic in support of British interests. Her tasking will see her supporting counter-narcotics efforts in the West African region as well as providing reassurance to UK territories and dependencies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Borbone will be the last commanding officer of a Type 42 destroyer. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a real privilege. HMS Edinburgh might be the last of the class but she remains a capable ship with a highly-trained and motivated ship’s company that is determined to preserve the fine tradition that the Type 42s have established in 30 years of service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MOD Police launch Defence Road Safety Week Road Show</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Defence Road Safety Week a Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) Road Show will take a mobile police station to different MOD establishments under the banner of its Home Front Community Safety Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative supports National Road Safety Week, promoted by Brake, the road safety charity, and both events run from Monday 21 November to Sunday 27 November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDP Community Safety Manager for the North East, Sergeant Gavin Alcroft, who is managing the initiative for the MDP, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This will be the sixth year we have carried out a national road show event. We provide information on road safety but we also have equipment on board that allows us to carry out interactive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We show high impact road safety films and we encourage visitors to take a Highway Code quiz with the chance to win a goody bag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national theme of Road Safety Week 2011 is ‘Too Young to Die’ and it focuses on the fact that road crashes are sudden, violent events that can rip families apart by ending lives too soon and causing life-changing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those affected are young and these casualties send shock waves through families and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDP Community Safety Manager for Scotland, Sergeant George Smart, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These casualties are preventable as they are often caused by factors such as driving too fast, overtaking dangerously, driving while using a mobile, driving whilst over the limit, drug driving, driving when tired or failing to use a seat belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest official figures show that there were 1,850 road casualties in the UK overall in 2010 - a reduction of 17 per cent on 2009. Within the MOD, road casualty trends and statistics are down too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="PC Colin Everett helps get the road safety message across at RAF Wittering" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5612/MOD_Police_launch_Defence_Road_Safety_Week_Road_Show_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;PC Colin Everett helps get the road safety message across at RAF Wittering [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, 37 military personnel were killed in on and off duty road traffic incidents. The statistics show that Armed Services personnel are twice as likely to be killed in a road traffic incident as their civilian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Moate, of the Defence Road Safety Team, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the first six months of 2011, six out of the ten MOD fatalities recorded were of personnel riding motorcycles. These statistics cover any MOD employee killed as a result of a road traffic accident, irrespective of circumstance, and include passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything that we can do to help lower this figure through extra training and workshops, using the support of local authorities and the police, is time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MDP have Community Police Officers and Community Safety Officers stationed across the country who can be contacted for information on road safety activities and initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to remain focused on raising awareness of road safety and promoting safer driving across the Defence Estate,” said Sergeant Alcroft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are keen to target attitudes to driving and road use - on and off duty - for military personnel, particularly the younger element, as well as raising awareness in Service families of those important safety messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the national theme is important, we are also mindful of local issues and problems. Where these are identified, they are targeted by our local officers, so please approach them if you have concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road show is scheduled to carry out visits to the Defence Munitions centres at Beith and Longtown, MOD St Athan, the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and HM Naval Base Clyde - covering defence communities in Scotland, England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces' contribution to Libya campaign</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a media briefing held earlier today, 27 October, in the Ministry of Defence Main Building, Air Marshal Peach began with a brief narrative of the operation recalling that, in February, as a result of the deterioration of the situation in Libya, there was quite a lot of work for Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) to do in terms of getting entitled persons out of the country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to say about that is to say thank you to the government and the people of Malta for letting us form a base there. In terms of geography, that gave us a special advantage to deal with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PJHQ, under the Air Marshal’s command, is a high-readiness group of people, ready to deploy rapidly around the world when something happens. In this case, they formed a non-combatant evacuation coordination cell, and by doing this avoided the situation where potentially three different countries could have sent three different aircraft in a disorganised way to pick up the same group of people: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a very soft attempt to coordinate across a group of nations who were all trying to do the same thing,” said the Air Marshal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was very successful. It was quite a tough call. We took a risk on the Sunday in particular, when we went deep with a C-130 into the desert. It was uncertain because of the number and nationality of the people there kept fluctuating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the same objective, Type 22 frigate HMS Cumberland was then moved into Benghazi harbour, which the Air Marshal also described as very uncertain at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it was a very successful part of the story, we evacuated 1,400 people out of a total of 4,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An added advantage gained from this operation, known as Op DEFERENCE, was that it built up knowledge of the country and provoked some thinking about what might happen next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were a bit surprised at how quickly things moved on,” said the Air Marshal. “We had the USCR 97 at the end of February, the National Transition Council established 5 March and then the no-fly zone was established. In quick time, some very successful operations were developed leading up to the hand over to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost a maritime embargo was established in which the Royal Navy played a key role with a number of ships and people who understood very well command and control in these situations and how to do boarding and embargo operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The influence of UK officers and men and women in command and control throughout this operation is something we should pay tribute to,” said Air Marshal Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A no-fly zone was quickly established. Having been personally involved in four of these in previous times, the Air Marshal said that, “we know how to do that.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO then took over, naming the operation ‘UNIFIED PROTECTOR’, and set up its HQ in Naples, a traditional NATO control centre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the important features of this operation is the harmony and the importance of the role of Italy,” said Air Marshal Peach, “harmony because the Italian military authorities have been extremely good hosts for the UK, and the importance of the geography is pretty obvious. The amount of support they gave us, bases, fuel, logistics, command and control was and is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In supporting civilians who were being “quite aggressively killed by the Libyan forces,” Air Marshal Peach said that what he wanted to highlight above all was the importance of the precise application of force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We judged, and I continue to judge, that unnecessary damage, or worse, the causing of civilian casualties would be a strategic liability for the campaign. The discipline of the ship, aircraft and helicopter crews are something I want to record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with NATO partners, Apache attack helicopters were introduced, mounted from HMS Ocean, to provide a useful tactical capability and, at the request of the NTC special advisers, “not Special Forces,” were introduced and who played a useful role in supporting the NTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key military objective at this point in addition to protecting civilians from pro-Gaddafi forces was reducing the command and control of the regime to stop the attack on their own people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what was going on inside Libya was a key task throughout, not just along the coastal strip but deep inside the country as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also had some unusual tasks,” said Air Marshal Peach, “which I would not have predicted - for example, guarding Libyan dinars contained in a RAF C17 flown into Benghazi to get the money flowing; done, for obvious reasons, in complete secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point after all this investment of effort, we were not going to spoil it by being wanton in the application of force. So a number of times we held back, we held off, we made sure that the rules of engagement were strictly followed,” said Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have now reached the point where we are continuing to support operations awaiting direction from the North Atlantic Council, which we expect in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes and lessons that have been identified by PJHQ include precision in the use of weapons which has been, the Air Marshal felt, world class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The accuracy, the consistency, and the predictions of the serviceability of our weapons has been confounded. The British weapons in particular have been world class. The low collateral damage of Brimstone is at the top end of anybody’s inventory in the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this precision, the Air Marshal argued, was not just because the bombs were good, but because of the ways in which the ships crews and the air crews are using and interpreting the rules of engagement, using their weapons in a disciplined way, guided by the AWACS aircrews operating 24-hours-a-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The helicopters that deployed provided the ability to go as deep as 50 miles (80km) inland against a series of military targets. Video footage shows a crew taking out a target with two hellfire missiles; the second being fired and destroying the vehicle after those on the ground had been given time to flee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At no point,” said the Air Marshal, “have British servicemen targeted individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tornados carried British-designed and British-built Brimstone missiles, which proved to be a world class weapon system. The Tornado, although undeniably an old platform, is bang up to date in terms of what’s going on inside the cockpit as far as control software, intelligence and reconnaissance is concerned, the Air Marshal said, and he also praised the ground crews who worked round the clock to make sure the aircraft kept flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a new aircraft is the Typhoon, and the Air Marshal said the aircraft had been adapted to carry weapons such as laser-guided bombs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained that the complimentary way Typhoons worked alongside the Tornados, using their targeting pods to create additional intelligence and reconnaissance, was very important: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Typhoon has been a great success on this operation,” he said. “We have also been very pleased with the way that the Army Air Corps adapted to life on the ocean wave aboard HMS Ocean; a first for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Marshall Peach closed by saying that the UK did not do all this alone, and that the success of the operation had depended on the input of 19 partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/07/18 - Address to the Centre for a New American Security</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Bill [Bill Lynn, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, now CEO of DRS Technologies] for that introduction and it’s a great pleasure and a privilege to be here at CNAS this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was here in Washington in January, I spoke about how Europe needed to respond to the challenge laid down by Bob Gates in the seminal speech he made in Brussels - a challenge which was reiterated by Secretary Panetta when he took up his role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked about how serious imbalances in NATO capabilities, demonstrated so starkly by the Libya campaign, represented a further challenge to the European NATO Allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the twin requirements to collective security and economic stability, meant that, in the short to medium term, given the pressure on budgets across the Alliance, more money is not in reality likely to be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, in an era of budgetary austerity, NATO’s Smart Defence initiative required greater collaboration between NATO Allies, and with our trusted partners, to produce capability more efficiently, and that the greatest effect would be generated by small groups working together, not through cumbersome mechanisms designed for unanimity at 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since January, I have taken that message to Europe: to Berlin, to Paris, and to Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe we are heading in the right direction. Everybody gets it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the NATO summit in Chicago we laid the groundwork for an Alliance based on more equitable burden-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have to make this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I want to zero in on one of the most effective drivers of collective North Atlantic military capability - the relationship between the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to explain to you the reforms the UK is making to the way we deliver military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I want to reassure you about our resolve to remain a capable ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to begin to sketch out for you the next phase of the collaboration between our two great countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="an-essential-alliance"&gt;An Essential Alliance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Obama during his State visit to Britain last year, described the Anglo-American relationship as “one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he identified the role of the relationship in driving wider collaboration. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At a time when threats and challenges require nations to work in concert with one another, we remain the greatest catalyst for global action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was thinking particularly of the Libya campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of our alliance is based on the twin pillars of common values and common interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our common values of democracy, the rule of law, the free market, freedom of speech and freedom of conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our common interests in maintaining an open, free-trading, stable and secure international environment in which our citizens can prosper and our values can spread and flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our economic and cultural relationship is significant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are each other’s largest single foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are each other’s top partners in science, innovation and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is our Defence relationship which stands out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forged in the furnaces of the world wars of the 20th century;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintained through the long watches of the Cold War;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now tempered over the last decade in the sands of Iraq and in the shadow of the Hindu Kush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our Defence relationship is not a backward-looking one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are about to enter a new phase in our long history together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As President Obama said in January “we are turning a page on a decade of war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, as for the US, this will mean bringing an end to more than a decade of enduring operations in the wake of 9/11, as we transition from a combat role in Afghanistan to a contingent posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me set out to you how the United Kingdom is taking this opportunity to reconfigure our Armed Forces to face the new threats that await us in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our objective is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain highly capable, agile Armed Forces, supported by balanced budgets, disciplined processes, with an efficient and effective Department of State behind them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepared for a future of contingency rather than predictability;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For rapid reaction rather than long-planned rotations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the future character of warfare with investment in ISR, cyber and unmanned technologies;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, crucially, more interoperable with our primary international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-transformation-of-uk-defence"&gt;The Transformation of UK Defence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation to a contingent posture is, of course, complicated by the need to deal with the fiscal challenge facing our economy; a challenge shared by many of our allies, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action being taken by the UK to bring our fiscal position under control is in itself an essential strategic underpinning to future sustainable defence capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiscal integrity and economic robustness is the well-spring of strategic strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, surely, is one of the primary lessons of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also had to deal with an equipment plan beset by overspends and over-optimistic programming - problems, I know, that are not entirely unknown on this side of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have acted early.  We have been decisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to assure you of our resolve to remain a strong and capable ally of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review set the strategic direction and began the process;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting the legacy of the Cold War behind us;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focussing on the deployable, expeditionary, well equipped forces we will need in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now taken this process forward, going through the equipment programme line by line;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing honesty into our Defence plan;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordering only what we can fund and sustain;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by doing so, not only bringing our Defence Budget back into balance for the first time in a generation;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But providing our forces with the reassurance that if it is in the programme, we have the budget to pay for it, and it is going to be delivered to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they can start plan with certainty for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also set out the design for the British Army of 2020 as we recover capabilities from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intelligent approach that minimises the impact on military effect of a reduction in regular manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating more fully regular and reserve forces;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And using our contractors more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that manpower reductions are taken in areas where Reserves and contractors can most rapidly provide support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximising teeth, by transforming the way we deliver the tail.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing a core of highly trained Reaction forces, supported by an Adaptive force able to undertake standing tasks, overseas capacity building, homeland resilience and provide the capability for sustained operations when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An army that will remain the most capable deployable fighting force outside the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have set out a blueprint for the reform of the management of defence as well;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewing the way strategic direction is provided;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing authority and accountability down the chain of command;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging innovation and budgetary responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And developing, as Bill mentioned, a new strategy for the procurement of defence equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to instil private sector skills and disciplines to our acquisition process, driving up productivity, by bringing a private sector partner into the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And creating clearer and harder relationships between the different functions in the Defence procurement chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a necessary precursor to re-setting the relationship with the defence industry - offering new opportunities for collaboration; but demanding in exchange renewed pursuit of efficiencies in the delivery of military programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what we have done has been painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the books and creating a sustainable forward Defence programme has meant reducing personnel numbers and retiring some capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has meant accepting, and managing, some capability risks. The reductions we are making are broadly proportionate to those being planned in the Pentagon, but of course from a baseline an order of magnitude smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are difficult decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Bill said in his farewell speech last year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Keeping programs alive on the hope that there will be more funds in the future is dangerous behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is better to have a smaller but ready force, and fewer but healthy programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when our retrenchment is complete, we will continue to have the fourth largest defence budget in the world;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceeding the NATO standard of 2% of GDP; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending £160bn - around $250bn - on our equipment programme over the next 10 years;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering the next generation of military technology and platforms that will help provide a battle-winning edge;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regenerating our carrier strike capability with our new Queen Elizabeth Class carriers and superb F-35B aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retaining sufficient mass to play a significant role in large coalition operations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, crucially, supported by the political will to deploy our forces when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, the watchword has been capability, not size - capability that can be deployed swiftly within a force posture that is inherently adaptable and configured to tackle the full range of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have taken great care to protect those capabilities that underpin our value as an ally to the US and in NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our command capability; our special forces; our industrial and technology base; the knowledge and experience of interoperability embedded in our structures and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, heeding Bill’s advice in that speech, the force we will be able to field in 2020 will be smaller, but better equipped, better supported and better configured to meet the challenges of the new security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Regular Army - smaller yes, but more agile;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better integrated, with a more deployable Reserve;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structured to allow rapid reaction and expeditionary warfare;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capable of conducting the full spectrum of operations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Able to deploy and sustain a Brigade-sized force indefinitely or a Division-sized force in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Royal Air Force that will be operating fleets of multi role Typhoon and ground attack Tornado aircraft before the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II - with a support fleet of C17, A400M transport aircraft and Voyager transporter and Air-to-Air refueller, as well as a full suite of UAVs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy operating one of the most advanced anti-aircraft destroyers in the world, the Type 45, with work advancing on our new Type 26 Global Combat Ship and the nuclear Astute Class submarine programme nearing completion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying the STOVL version of the F-35B will allow us quickly to generate strike capability from our next generation aircraft carriers - the largest warships ever to enter service with the Royal Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am extremely grateful to the US Navy and Marine Corps for the support they are providing to allow us to maintain and regenerate the skill sets we need to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course this core force is supplemented by the whole panoply of joint-force enablers including C4ISTAR and our world class Special Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is underpinned by our continuous, at sea, nuclear deterrent which we are committed to retaining and replacing in due course as it reaches the end of its current life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the criticism in the domestic press, these are not the Armed Forces of a nation in retreat, but of one determined to provide the most effective, capable and deployable Armed Forces after those of the United States itself;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready and able to protect the national interest and to contribute to global security;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong enough to protect our own interests;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large enough to command coalition operations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced enough to operate alongside the US anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the shape of the future British Armed Forces that you in the US can expect to be operating alongside you in the field as your most capable and committed military ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-pivot"&gt;The Pivot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we draw down from Afghanistan, our shared analysis of the future security environment points to a period that is unpredictable, volatile and with diverse threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threats that need to be met as they evolve, upstream and at distance, rather than waiting for them to come to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in which the rising strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region requires all countries, but particularly the United States, to reflect in their strategic posture, the emergence of China as a global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from being concerned about the ‘tilt’ to Asia Pacific, the European NATO powers should welcome the fact that the US is willing to engage this new strategic challenge on behalf of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And recognise that, as a result, European nations, including the UK, will need to do much more of the heavy lifting to ensure security in their own region and in the Middle East, North Africa and the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the ‘end of Atlanticism’, but the beginning of a new, more balanced era in the relationships within the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priority of the UK will remain, after the protection of our homeland and dependent territories, to ensure the enduring security and stability of Europe and its near abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recalibration of burden-sharing is the way close allies should respond to shifts in the geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the defence relationship with the US will always be paramount. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to support your rebalancing, we will seek to work more closely with our neighbours in Europe, particularly France and Germany, to enhance the capabilities of our own region, for homeland defence and for intervention abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that Europe makes its contribution to upholding the international system that underpins our collective security and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a division of labour which is firmly in our mutual interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this makes UK/US co-operation any less important. On the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in January, no country, not even the United States, can hope to tackle successfully all the threats we face in common, by acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the UK will continue to stand alongside the US in tackling these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we in the UK have faced up to the challenge set first by Secretary Gates, and then by Secretary Panetta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out our Transformation programme and have begun to deliver it. We identified the role that we need to play as the Alliance responds to the US pivot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already on the road to delivering the sustainable Armed Forces that will give us the capability we need for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we are ready to map out the next steps in our cooperation with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we drawdown from this decade of continuous operations - and continuous military co-operation, the circumstances are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so our relationship needs to evolve in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the immediacy of those enduring operations, that we’ve had for the last 10 years, we need to act to maintain the immense knowledge, skills and habits of co-operation built up between our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will require a renewed emphasis on training and exercising after 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good start will be to make full use of the training potential of the recently announced decision to rotate US-based Brigade Combat Teams through the NATO Response Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need to go further, do more, if we are going  to maintain the extraordinary level of mil-mil cooperation built up over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me set out three areas where I think the national interest of our countries, and the collective interests of our partners, would be served by more far reaching US-UK co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - in new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of our defence strategies are based on retaining the technological edge of our armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment of rapid technological change and significant resource constraint, we should do more to align requirements more closely and work collaboratively to deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in neither of our interests to duplicate research and development for new systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no two countries are better placed to work together for the common good than Britain and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern, battle winning equipment and weapons have become extraordinarily expensive, so there is merit in cooperating more fully - pooling demand, investment and technology - as we have done with the F35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of Smart Defence it is even more vital that we do more together both on the battlefield and in development of future systems.  Working together to ensure our forces have the best equipment and can operate side by side whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly - new domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of our countries recognise that the character of conflict is changing.  The threats that are arising in cyberspace are not limited by geography nor can they be addressed through conventional military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to think differently about the way we protect critical infrastructure more likely to be rendered inoperable through a computer virus than a bombing raid.  And we have to work together to help our defence industries protect themselves from espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill has been a tireless advocate for greater co-operation between our countries in tackling some of these threats. It’s thanks to him that we now have great co-operation underway at CYBERCOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Collaboration Memorandum signed last year, has established the framework for our nations to work more closely in this domain and we should capitalise on the opportunities it presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly - I want to suggest we need a new approach to security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of our defence strategies call for tackling threats upstream before they become crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both recognise that prevention is better than cure. And we are both changing the structure of our Armed Forces to be better prepared for building the capacity of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting opportunities to work together, to burden share and to learn from each other, just as we have done over the last decade of stabilisation and counter insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the key lesson we have learnt from Iraq and Afghanistan is that security cannot be delivered by our militaries acting alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to align all of our levers of national power and influence to achieve our objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, our Strategic Defence and Security Review - precisely that, not just defence but a broader security review- concluded that we need to marshal our development assistance, diplomatic efforts and defence engagement if we are to truly tackle the root causes of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the US government is also looking at how it can make its security assistance as effective as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that this effort cannot end at national borders though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be truly effective we need to make this a multi-national as well as multi-agency approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British military officers, working with American development experts; British diplomats working with US military stabilization teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to conclude Ladies and Gentlemen, it can sometimes seem that we take for granted, that when needs must, the Armed Forces of the US and UK can operate in the field together, in tough circumstances, sharing the dangers and risks, in appearance of seamlessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this capability is not “for granted”; it didn’t occur by chance; the apparent effortlessness is born of hard work and constant attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one single month earlier this year, UK military personnel took part in 10 separate training exercises with US forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why, when we do go to war together, we trust each other, we understand each other, we respect each other, and we can rely on each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonds between our Armed Forces are special, just as the bonds between our people are special.  They took time to build and they run very deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have been tested over the last decade, in the wake of 9/11, and found to be robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we now enter a new era where meeting the needs of national security and collective defence requires us to re-balance the way we do things as an Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe doing more in its own back yard as the US tilts to the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain retains the military power to help drive this process in Europe, with France and Germany, creating greater capability, backed up by political will to act, while reinforcing our partnership with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new era for Atlanticism - still based on shared values and shared interest, but increasingly too, on a burden shared more equitably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not underestimate the challenges ahead in energising the NATO alliance to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all acutely conscious of economic and fiscal pressures to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that the threats we face are many, varied and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing we can be certain of in this uncertain world is that we will achieve more, reach further, and be safer, if Britain and the US make a conscious decision to preserve and strengthen the remarkable and enduring collaboration we already have at so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my purpose in coming here today is to assure you that now, more than ever, we are ready and able to do that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/07/18 - F-35 Lightning II Handover Ceremony</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK is delighted to be the United States’ Tier One partner in this project and to be the first overseas customer to take delivery of the F-35 Lightning II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took some difficult decisions two years ago to sort out our Defence Budget that had spiralled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That included the very tough decisions to retire early the Ark Royal aircraft carrier and its Harrier jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has allowed us to invest in more modern, cutting edge technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the clearest example of that as we can see before us how Britain is regenerating its Carrier Strike capability with modern, fifth generation, jets to compliment our two new aircraft carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spoken to some of our personnel out here I know they are very much looking forward to taking delivery of our first aircraft and are excited about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force will start receiving frontline jets in 2016, with land-based testing and training flights through 2017, followed by initial test flights from the Queen Elizabeth carrier in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stealth jets will give us a leading role in maritime power projection and by far exceed the capabilities of the old Harriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnificent aircraft behind us typifies the depth of the US-UK Defence relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not Just a Government to Government relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even an Armed Forces to Armed Forces relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a deepening industry to industry relationship too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are continuing to build on the joint strengths of our nations’ proud histories of close co-operation to deliver truly world-beating equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having committed $2bn to the development of the F-35 Lightening II, the UK is enjoying a 15% share of the production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period of peak production is likely to sustain 25,000 jobs in the UK across a number of contractors and sub-contractors including, for instance, BAE Systems and Rolls Royce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning II will provide us with a flexible capability that will out perform anything we have been able to put in the field before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would like to thank all those involved in getting us where we are today, from across the Armed Forces, across Government and across industry, on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all I pay tribute to the UK personnel for all their work in achieving clearance for this aircraft today and making the Operational Test and Evaluation phase a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also very conscious that the UK’s recent decision to procure the STOVL variant has caused considerable extra effort by the Project Office and Lockheed Martin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is very grateful to you all for your flexibility and the support you have shown as we work through these changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am especially grateful to the Department of Defense, the US Navy and Marine Corps for their unstinting support, without which the regeneration of UK carrier capability would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fully committed to the programme and the coming year will see a quickening of the pace, as we order the long lead materials and early aircraft deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry, Bob, Frank, I am delighted to be here to witness this most important landmark in Defence aviation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handover of BK1 to the United Kingdom represents a new chapter in the long story of co-operation between our nations and industries - and a crucial step toward regeneration of Britain’s carrier strike capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now invite Lockheed Martin to start the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 255 British and about 650 Argentine troops died after the UK sent a task force to the islands to combat the Argentine invasion on 2 April 1982, and Prime Minister David Cameron has suggested that the day is used to remember both the Argentine and British dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Cameron said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today is a day for commemoration and reflection: a day to remember all those who lost their lives in the conflict - the members of our Armed Forces, as well as the Argentinian personnel who died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, we salute the heroism of the Task Force which set sail to free the islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are rightly proud of the role Britain played in righting a profound wrong. And the people of the Falkland Islands can be justly proud of the prosperous and secure future they have built for their islands since 1982.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterans of the war have paid their respects at Britain’s National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. A single candle was lit in Arboretum’s Millennium Chapel as part of the ceremony and will be left alight for the 74 days of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiated by the South Atlantic Medal Association (SAMA 82), a memorial to the 255 UK servicemen who were killed during the conflict will be unveiled at the Arboretum on 20 May, in front of more than 600 veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK commits more troops to Balkans peacekeeping mission</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company of soldiers will be based in the UK, ready to deploy at short notice to the region if required as part of EUFOR (European Union Force) Operation ALTHEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation ALTHEA has the backing of a UN mandate and provides a military presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina to help maintain a safe and secure environment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This contribution reflects the UK’s strong political support for EUFOR Operation ALTHEA and our determination to help maintain a safe and secure environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the security situation in the region remains calm and stable, it is essential that we provide EUFOR with the necessary resources to perform the mission’s mandate in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EUFOR provides an important safeguard underpinning stability and ensuring that Bosnia and Herzegovina can continue to make progress on its path towards EU and NATO accession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pledge of more troops in support of Operation ALTHEA will not take place until December in order not to impact on the Armed Forces’ commitment to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR Operation ALTHEA became the legal successor in December 2004 to NATO’s SFOR (Stabilisation Force) mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR has the backing of a UN Chapter VII Mandate and its aim is to ensure continued compliance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the continuance of a safe and secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Prince and King visit HMS Liverpool</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Type 42 destroyer is being decommissioned after 30 years in the Royal Navy and will be sailing into Portsmouth for the final time on Monday flying her decommissioning pennant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool’s final task has been to support HMS Illustrious and Bulwark in winter war games in the fjords of Norway on Exercise Cold Response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise has seen 16,000 personnel from a dozen nations, including the host, Norway, and warships from half-a-dozen navies, play out complex manoeuvres at sea and on land over ten days, practising the art of putting a sizeable amphibious force ashore in the harshest environment imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the exercise comes to a close, Prince Charles and King Harald V of Norway have visited HMS Liverpool and her 240-strong ship’s company in the Norwegian city of Bergen. This was the final royal visit aboard the veteran destroyer on her final stop in a foreign port on her final active duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prince Charles and King Harald discussed the ship’s recent experiences during operations in Libya where her main gun fired more than 200 rounds in support of the NATO and UN mission providing protection for the Libyan people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prince Charles told the assembled members of the ship’s company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s taken me some time to discover what you were up to out there - and how you were being fired at. It seems a great deal more hairy than we imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Liverpool has visited Bergen for three days, coinciding with an official visit to the country by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as visiting Liverpool, Prince Charles and King Harald toured the M/V Brennholm to see the work the Institute of Marine Research is doing to encourage sustainable fishing, not least replenishing severely-depleted cod stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
