    <title>MOD Police launch Defence Road Safety Week Road Show</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Defence Road Safety Week a Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) Road Show will take a mobile police station to different MOD establishments under the banner of its Home Front Community Safety Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative supports National Road Safety Week, promoted by Brake, the road safety charity, and both events run from Monday 21 November to Sunday 27 November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDP Community Safety Manager for the North East, Sergeant Gavin Alcroft, who is managing the initiative for the MDP, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This will be the sixth year we have carried out a national road show event. We provide information on road safety but we also have equipment on board that allows us to carry out interactive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We show high impact road safety films and we encourage visitors to take a Highway Code quiz with the chance to win a goody bag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national theme of Road Safety Week 2011 is ‘Too Young to Die’ and it focuses on the fact that road crashes are sudden, violent events that can rip families apart by ending lives too soon and causing life-changing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those affected are young and these casualties send shock waves through families and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDP Community Safety Manager for Scotland, Sergeant George Smart, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These casualties are preventable as they are often caused by factors such as driving too fast, overtaking dangerously, driving while using a mobile, driving whilst over the limit, drug driving, driving when tired or failing to use a seat belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest official figures show that there were 1,850 road casualties in the UK overall in 2010 - a reduction of 17 per cent on 2009. Within the MOD, road casualty trends and statistics are down too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="PC Colin Everett helps get the road safety message across at RAF Wittering" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5612/MOD_Police_launch_Defence_Road_Safety_Week_Road_Show_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;PC Colin Everett helps get the road safety message across at RAF Wittering [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, 37 military personnel were killed in on and off duty road traffic incidents. The statistics show that Armed Services personnel are twice as likely to be killed in a road traffic incident as their civilian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Moate, of the Defence Road Safety Team, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the first six months of 2011, six out of the ten MOD fatalities recorded were of personnel riding motorcycles. These statistics cover any MOD employee killed as a result of a road traffic accident, irrespective of circumstance, and include passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything that we can do to help lower this figure through extra training and workshops, using the support of local authorities and the police, is time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MDP have Community Police Officers and Community Safety Officers stationed across the country who can be contacted for information on road safety activities and initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to remain focused on raising awareness of road safety and promoting safer driving across the Defence Estate,” said Sergeant Alcroft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are keen to target attitudes to driving and road use - on and off duty - for military personnel, particularly the younger element, as well as raising awareness in Service families of those important safety messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the national theme is important, we are also mindful of local issues and problems. Where these are identified, they are targeted by our local officers, so please approach them if you have concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road show is scheduled to carry out visits to the Defence Munitions centres at Beith and Longtown, MOD St Athan, the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and HM Naval Base Clyde - covering defence communities in Scotland, England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/07/18 - Address to the Centre for a New American Security</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Bill [Bill Lynn, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, now CEO of DRS Technologies] for that introduction and it’s a great pleasure and a privilege to be here at CNAS this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was here in Washington in January, I spoke about how Europe needed to respond to the challenge laid down by Bob Gates in the seminal speech he made in Brussels - a challenge which was reiterated by Secretary Panetta when he took up his role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked about how serious imbalances in NATO capabilities, demonstrated so starkly by the Libya campaign, represented a further challenge to the European NATO Allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the twin requirements to collective security and economic stability, meant that, in the short to medium term, given the pressure on budgets across the Alliance, more money is not in reality likely to be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, in an era of budgetary austerity, NATO’s Smart Defence initiative required greater collaboration between NATO Allies, and with our trusted partners, to produce capability more efficiently, and that the greatest effect would be generated by small groups working together, not through cumbersome mechanisms designed for unanimity at 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since January, I have taken that message to Europe: to Berlin, to Paris, and to Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe we are heading in the right direction. Everybody gets it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the NATO summit in Chicago we laid the groundwork for an Alliance based on more equitable burden-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have to make this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I want to zero in on one of the most effective drivers of collective North Atlantic military capability - the relationship between the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to explain to you the reforms the UK is making to the way we deliver military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I want to reassure you about our resolve to remain a capable ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to begin to sketch out for you the next phase of the collaboration between our two great countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="an-essential-alliance"&gt;An Essential Alliance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Obama during his State visit to Britain last year, described the Anglo-American relationship as “one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he identified the role of the relationship in driving wider collaboration. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At a time when threats and challenges require nations to work in concert with one another, we remain the greatest catalyst for global action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was thinking particularly of the Libya campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of our alliance is based on the twin pillars of common values and common interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our common values of democracy, the rule of law, the free market, freedom of speech and freedom of conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our common interests in maintaining an open, free-trading, stable and secure international environment in which our citizens can prosper and our values can spread and flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our economic and cultural relationship is significant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are each other’s largest single foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are each other’s top partners in science, innovation and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is our Defence relationship which stands out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forged in the furnaces of the world wars of the 20th century;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintained through the long watches of the Cold War;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now tempered over the last decade in the sands of Iraq and in the shadow of the Hindu Kush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our Defence relationship is not a backward-looking one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are about to enter a new phase in our long history together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As President Obama said in January “we are turning a page on a decade of war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, as for the US, this will mean bringing an end to more than a decade of enduring operations in the wake of 9/11, as we transition from a combat role in Afghanistan to a contingent posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me set out to you how the United Kingdom is taking this opportunity to reconfigure our Armed Forces to face the new threats that await us in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our objective is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain highly capable, agile Armed Forces, supported by balanced budgets, disciplined processes, with an efficient and effective Department of State behind them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepared for a future of contingency rather than predictability;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For rapid reaction rather than long-planned rotations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the future character of warfare with investment in ISR, cyber and unmanned technologies;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, crucially, more interoperable with our primary international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-transformation-of-uk-defence"&gt;The Transformation of UK Defence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation to a contingent posture is, of course, complicated by the need to deal with the fiscal challenge facing our economy; a challenge shared by many of our allies, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action being taken by the UK to bring our fiscal position under control is in itself an essential strategic underpinning to future sustainable defence capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiscal integrity and economic robustness is the well-spring of strategic strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, surely, is one of the primary lessons of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also had to deal with an equipment plan beset by overspends and over-optimistic programming - problems, I know, that are not entirely unknown on this side of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have acted early.  We have been decisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to assure you of our resolve to remain a strong and capable ally of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review set the strategic direction and began the process;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting the legacy of the Cold War behind us;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focussing on the deployable, expeditionary, well equipped forces we will need in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now taken this process forward, going through the equipment programme line by line;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing honesty into our Defence plan;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordering only what we can fund and sustain;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by doing so, not only bringing our Defence Budget back into balance for the first time in a generation;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But providing our forces with the reassurance that if it is in the programme, we have the budget to pay for it, and it is going to be delivered to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they can start plan with certainty for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also set out the design for the British Army of 2020 as we recover capabilities from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intelligent approach that minimises the impact on military effect of a reduction in regular manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating more fully regular and reserve forces;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And using our contractors more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that manpower reductions are taken in areas where Reserves and contractors can most rapidly provide support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximising teeth, by transforming the way we deliver the tail.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing a core of highly trained Reaction forces, supported by an Adaptive force able to undertake standing tasks, overseas capacity building, homeland resilience and provide the capability for sustained operations when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An army that will remain the most capable deployable fighting force outside the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have set out a blueprint for the reform of the management of defence as well;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewing the way strategic direction is provided;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing authority and accountability down the chain of command;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging innovation and budgetary responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And developing, as Bill mentioned, a new strategy for the procurement of defence equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to instil private sector skills and disciplines to our acquisition process, driving up productivity, by bringing a private sector partner into the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And creating clearer and harder relationships between the different functions in the Defence procurement chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a necessary precursor to re-setting the relationship with the defence industry - offering new opportunities for collaboration; but demanding in exchange renewed pursuit of efficiencies in the delivery of military programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what we have done has been painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the books and creating a sustainable forward Defence programme has meant reducing personnel numbers and retiring some capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has meant accepting, and managing, some capability risks. The reductions we are making are broadly proportionate to those being planned in the Pentagon, but of course from a baseline an order of magnitude smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are difficult decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Bill said in his farewell speech last year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Keeping programs alive on the hope that there will be more funds in the future is dangerous behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is better to have a smaller but ready force, and fewer but healthy programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when our retrenchment is complete, we will continue to have the fourth largest defence budget in the world;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceeding the NATO standard of 2% of GDP; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending £160bn - around $250bn - on our equipment programme over the next 10 years;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering the next generation of military technology and platforms that will help provide a battle-winning edge;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regenerating our carrier strike capability with our new Queen Elizabeth Class carriers and superb F-35B aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retaining sufficient mass to play a significant role in large coalition operations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, crucially, supported by the political will to deploy our forces when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, the watchword has been capability, not size - capability that can be deployed swiftly within a force posture that is inherently adaptable and configured to tackle the full range of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have taken great care to protect those capabilities that underpin our value as an ally to the US and in NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our command capability; our special forces; our industrial and technology base; the knowledge and experience of interoperability embedded in our structures and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, heeding Bill’s advice in that speech, the force we will be able to field in 2020 will be smaller, but better equipped, better supported and better configured to meet the challenges of the new security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Regular Army - smaller yes, but more agile;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better integrated, with a more deployable Reserve;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structured to allow rapid reaction and expeditionary warfare;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capable of conducting the full spectrum of operations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Able to deploy and sustain a Brigade-sized force indefinitely or a Division-sized force in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Royal Air Force that will be operating fleets of multi role Typhoon and ground attack Tornado aircraft before the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II - with a support fleet of C17, A400M transport aircraft and Voyager transporter and Air-to-Air refueller, as well as a full suite of UAVs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy operating one of the most advanced anti-aircraft destroyers in the world, the Type 45, with work advancing on our new Type 26 Global Combat Ship and the nuclear Astute Class submarine programme nearing completion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying the STOVL version of the F-35B will allow us quickly to generate strike capability from our next generation aircraft carriers - the largest warships ever to enter service with the Royal Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am extremely grateful to the US Navy and Marine Corps for the support they are providing to allow us to maintain and regenerate the skill sets we need to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course this core force is supplemented by the whole panoply of joint-force enablers including C4ISTAR and our world class Special Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is underpinned by our continuous, at sea, nuclear deterrent which we are committed to retaining and replacing in due course as it reaches the end of its current life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the criticism in the domestic press, these are not the Armed Forces of a nation in retreat, but of one determined to provide the most effective, capable and deployable Armed Forces after those of the United States itself;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready and able to protect the national interest and to contribute to global security;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong enough to protect our own interests;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large enough to command coalition operations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced enough to operate alongside the US anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the shape of the future British Armed Forces that you in the US can expect to be operating alongside you in the field as your most capable and committed military ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-pivot"&gt;The Pivot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we draw down from Afghanistan, our shared analysis of the future security environment points to a period that is unpredictable, volatile and with diverse threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threats that need to be met as they evolve, upstream and at distance, rather than waiting for them to come to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in which the rising strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region requires all countries, but particularly the United States, to reflect in their strategic posture, the emergence of China as a global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from being concerned about the ‘tilt’ to Asia Pacific, the European NATO powers should welcome the fact that the US is willing to engage this new strategic challenge on behalf of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And recognise that, as a result, European nations, including the UK, will need to do much more of the heavy lifting to ensure security in their own region and in the Middle East, North Africa and the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the ‘end of Atlanticism’, but the beginning of a new, more balanced era in the relationships within the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priority of the UK will remain, after the protection of our homeland and dependent territories, to ensure the enduring security and stability of Europe and its near abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recalibration of burden-sharing is the way close allies should respond to shifts in the geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the defence relationship with the US will always be paramount. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to support your rebalancing, we will seek to work more closely with our neighbours in Europe, particularly France and Germany, to enhance the capabilities of our own region, for homeland defence and for intervention abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that Europe makes its contribution to upholding the international system that underpins our collective security and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a division of labour which is firmly in our mutual interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this makes UK/US co-operation any less important. On the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in January, no country, not even the United States, can hope to tackle successfully all the threats we face in common, by acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the UK will continue to stand alongside the US in tackling these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we in the UK have faced up to the challenge set first by Secretary Gates, and then by Secretary Panetta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out our Transformation programme and have begun to deliver it. We identified the role that we need to play as the Alliance responds to the US pivot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already on the road to delivering the sustainable Armed Forces that will give us the capability we need for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we are ready to map out the next steps in our cooperation with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we drawdown from this decade of continuous operations - and continuous military co-operation, the circumstances are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so our relationship needs to evolve in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the immediacy of those enduring operations, that we’ve had for the last 10 years, we need to act to maintain the immense knowledge, skills and habits of co-operation built up between our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will require a renewed emphasis on training and exercising after 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good start will be to make full use of the training potential of the recently announced decision to rotate US-based Brigade Combat Teams through the NATO Response Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need to go further, do more, if we are going  to maintain the extraordinary level of mil-mil cooperation built up over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me set out three areas where I think the national interest of our countries, and the collective interests of our partners, would be served by more far reaching US-UK co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - in new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of our defence strategies are based on retaining the technological edge of our armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment of rapid technological change and significant resource constraint, we should do more to align requirements more closely and work collaboratively to deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in neither of our interests to duplicate research and development for new systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no two countries are better placed to work together for the common good than Britain and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern, battle winning equipment and weapons have become extraordinarily expensive, so there is merit in cooperating more fully - pooling demand, investment and technology - as we have done with the F35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of Smart Defence it is even more vital that we do more together both on the battlefield and in development of future systems.  Working together to ensure our forces have the best equipment and can operate side by side whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly - new domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of our countries recognise that the character of conflict is changing.  The threats that are arising in cyberspace are not limited by geography nor can they be addressed through conventional military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to think differently about the way we protect critical infrastructure more likely to be rendered inoperable through a computer virus than a bombing raid.  And we have to work together to help our defence industries protect themselves from espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill has been a tireless advocate for greater co-operation between our countries in tackling some of these threats. It’s thanks to him that we now have great co-operation underway at CYBERCOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Collaboration Memorandum signed last year, has established the framework for our nations to work more closely in this domain and we should capitalise on the opportunities it presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly - I want to suggest we need a new approach to security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of our defence strategies call for tackling threats upstream before they become crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both recognise that prevention is better than cure. And we are both changing the structure of our Armed Forces to be better prepared for building the capacity of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting opportunities to work together, to burden share and to learn from each other, just as we have done over the last decade of stabilisation and counter insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the key lesson we have learnt from Iraq and Afghanistan is that security cannot be delivered by our militaries acting alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to align all of our levers of national power and influence to achieve our objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, our Strategic Defence and Security Review - precisely that, not just defence but a broader security review- concluded that we need to marshal our development assistance, diplomatic efforts and defence engagement if we are to truly tackle the root causes of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the US government is also looking at how it can make its security assistance as effective as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that this effort cannot end at national borders though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be truly effective we need to make this a multi-national as well as multi-agency approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British military officers, working with American development experts; British diplomats working with US military stabilization teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to conclude Ladies and Gentlemen, it can sometimes seem that we take for granted, that when needs must, the Armed Forces of the US and UK can operate in the field together, in tough circumstances, sharing the dangers and risks, in appearance of seamlessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this capability is not “for granted”; it didn’t occur by chance; the apparent effortlessness is born of hard work and constant attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one single month earlier this year, UK military personnel took part in 10 separate training exercises with US forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why, when we do go to war together, we trust each other, we understand each other, we respect each other, and we can rely on each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonds between our Armed Forces are special, just as the bonds between our people are special.  They took time to build and they run very deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have been tested over the last decade, in the wake of 9/11, and found to be robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we now enter a new era where meeting the needs of national security and collective defence requires us to re-balance the way we do things as an Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe doing more in its own back yard as the US tilts to the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain retains the military power to help drive this process in Europe, with France and Germany, creating greater capability, backed up by political will to act, while reinforcing our partnership with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new era for Atlanticism - still based on shared values and shared interest, but increasingly too, on a burden shared more equitably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not underestimate the challenges ahead in energising the NATO alliance to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all acutely conscious of economic and fiscal pressures to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that the threats we face are many, varied and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing we can be certain of in this uncertain world is that we will achieve more, reach further, and be safer, if Britain and the US make a conscious decision to preserve and strengthen the remarkable and enduring collaboration we already have at so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my purpose in coming here today is to assure you that now, more than ever, we are ready and able to do that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/07/18 - F-35 Lightning II Handover Ceremony</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK is delighted to be the United States’ Tier One partner in this project and to be the first overseas customer to take delivery of the F-35 Lightning II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took some difficult decisions two years ago to sort out our Defence Budget that had spiralled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That included the very tough decisions to retire early the Ark Royal aircraft carrier and its Harrier jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has allowed us to invest in more modern, cutting edge technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the clearest example of that as we can see before us how Britain is regenerating its Carrier Strike capability with modern, fifth generation, jets to compliment our two new aircraft carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spoken to some of our personnel out here I know they are very much looking forward to taking delivery of our first aircraft and are excited about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force will start receiving frontline jets in 2016, with land-based testing and training flights through 2017, followed by initial test flights from the Queen Elizabeth carrier in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stealth jets will give us a leading role in maritime power projection and by far exceed the capabilities of the old Harriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnificent aircraft behind us typifies the depth of the US-UK Defence relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not Just a Government to Government relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even an Armed Forces to Armed Forces relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a deepening industry to industry relationship too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are continuing to build on the joint strengths of our nations’ proud histories of close co-operation to deliver truly world-beating equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having committed $2bn to the development of the F-35 Lightening II, the UK is enjoying a 15% share of the production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period of peak production is likely to sustain 25,000 jobs in the UK across a number of contractors and sub-contractors including, for instance, BAE Systems and Rolls Royce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lightning II will provide us with a flexible capability that will out perform anything we have been able to put in the field before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would like to thank all those involved in getting us where we are today, from across the Armed Forces, across Government and across industry, on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all I pay tribute to the UK personnel for all their work in achieving clearance for this aircraft today and making the Operational Test and Evaluation phase a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also very conscious that the UK’s recent decision to procure the STOVL variant has caused considerable extra effort by the Project Office and Lockheed Martin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is very grateful to you all for your flexibility and the support you have shown as we work through these changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am especially grateful to the Department of Defense, the US Navy and Marine Corps for their unstinting support, without which the regeneration of UK carrier capability would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fully committed to the programme and the coming year will see a quickening of the pace, as we order the long lead materials and early aircraft deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry, Bob, Frank, I am delighted to be here to witness this most important landmark in Defence aviation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handover of BK1 to the United Kingdom represents a new chapter in the long story of co-operation between our nations and industries - and a crucial step toward regeneration of Britain’s carrier strike capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now invite Lockheed Martin to start the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Services commemorate Falklands War anniversary</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 255 British and about 650 Argentine troops died after the UK sent a task force to the islands to combat the Argentine invasion on 2 April 1982, and Prime Minister David Cameron has suggested that the day is used to remember both the Argentine and British dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Cameron said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today is a day for commemoration and reflection: a day to remember all those who lost their lives in the conflict - the members of our Armed Forces, as well as the Argentinian personnel who died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, we salute the heroism of the Task Force which set sail to free the islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are rightly proud of the role Britain played in righting a profound wrong. And the people of the Falkland Islands can be justly proud of the prosperous and secure future they have built for their islands since 1982.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterans of the war have paid their respects at Britain’s National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. A single candle was lit in Arboretum’s Millennium Chapel as part of the ceremony and will be left alight for the 74 days of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiated by the South Atlantic Medal Association (SAMA 82), a memorial to the 255 UK servicemen who were killed during the conflict will be unveiled at the Arboretum on 20 May, in front of more than 600 veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK commits more troops to Balkans peacekeeping mission</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company of soldiers will be based in the UK, ready to deploy at short notice to the region if required as part of EUFOR (European Union Force) Operation ALTHEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation ALTHEA has the backing of a UN mandate and provides a military presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina to help maintain a safe and secure environment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This contribution reflects the UK’s strong political support for EUFOR Operation ALTHEA and our determination to help maintain a safe and secure environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the security situation in the region remains calm and stable, it is essential that we provide EUFOR with the necessary resources to perform the mission’s mandate in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EUFOR provides an important safeguard underpinning stability and ensuring that Bosnia and Herzegovina can continue to make progress on its path towards EU and NATO accession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pledge of more troops in support of Operation ALTHEA will not take place until December in order not to impact on the Armed Forces’ commitment to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR Operation ALTHEA became the legal successor in December 2004 to NATO’s SFOR (Stabilisation Force) mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR has the backing of a UN Chapter VII Mandate and its aim is to ensure continued compliance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the continuance of a safe and secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/03/21 - Franco-British Council 2012 Defence Conference</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je vous remercie pour l’opportunite d’assister a cette reunion du Conseil et d’avoir l’occasion de vous presenter une ou deux de mes pensees a propos de la cooperation franco-britannique dans le domaine de la defense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je suis toujours enchantes de visiter Paris et je suis particulierement content d’etre ici dans un contexte pareil; le succes de notre cooperation en Libye, le succes du Sommet le mois dernier, l’arrive d’un nouveau Ambassadeur et surtout l’approfondissement rapide de la cooperation entre nos armees et dans le domaine des equipements depuis la signature du Traite en 2010 [deux mille dix].  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m delighted to be here in the year that the Franco-British Council celebrates its 40th Anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an organisation which has grown in influence and stature over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a well established reputation for exploring the issues of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to see that Defence is recognised as an integral part of this ongoing dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I see you also have your own web page on the Franco-British Council site - [www.francobritishdefence.org] which acts as a really useful information hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the President D’Honneur, Madame Chairman and Council Members for their work in supporting - and promoting - this defence relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must also thank our Ambassador, (H.M. Ambassador Peter Ricketts) for so kindly hosting our conference. Given his previous role as our National Security Advisor, I am confident that deepening of our Franco-British Defence relationship will be a priority for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uk-france---the-importance-of-our-defence-relationship"&gt;UK-France - the importance of our Defence relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence is central to the values the UK and France share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to talk about our Defence relationship, and why it is important to seize this historic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About why it is important to drive forward this process of collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how we are doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me start with looking at why co-operation makes sense for lots of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His Excellency Bernard Emie, in a recent speech to the British defence community cited Professor Robert Tombs - the noted Cambridge academic - who I think summed it up pretty well. He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Franco British relations over the two centuries since Waterloo could be seen as a transformation from enmity to alliance and finally partnership…Today they are the only European states that maintain ambitions for a world role. Conceivably, both might prefer other partners, but in the world of the 2010s the reality is that we have only each other’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This eloquently defines the strategic necessity for our  bilateral relationship.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A partnership which makes sense because: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are both outward-looking nations, with experience and knowledge of almost every-part of the globe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We recognise we live a dangerous and uncertain world in which taking shelter behind some mythical Fortress Europe just isn’t an option&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We both understand the importance of a strong defence - not only to ensure that our territory is secure - but to contribute to international security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We invest in Defence and meet our NATO responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have battle winning capabilities and highly trained and effective Armed Forces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And crucially - we share the political will to act - and have the deployable defence capabilities to do so&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anyone who doubted that by the way only has to look at Libya. President Sarkozy was absolutely right when he described the UK and France as the ‘heavy lifters’ of European defence  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We share the same responsibilities on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As permanent members of the UN Security Council - as nuclear powers -as leading members of the G8, the EU and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We share a similar world view, we share the same geographic space, we are of similar size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With us there is no grand frere et petit frere - although the way our respective media portray our relationship you would think we are more like quarrelling siblings..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is a collaboration of logic and sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forces that pull us together are far more powerful than the forces that seek to drive us apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="libya-and-nato"&gt;Libya and NATO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya was a real turning point and an affirmation that forging a new and stronger partnership was the right thing to do.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Libya campaign was assisted by operating in a NATO framework.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO provided legitimacy, a Headquarters; as well as a common language and set of procedures.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is established, proven and based on shared values. It is a uniquely capable organisation as Libya - and indeed Afghanistan - have demonstrated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we need NATO to become stronger.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Libya showed us, there were a number of capability gaps which were highlighted by the Libya campaign.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We - the UK and France are now prioritising our joint work in light of lessons identified in areas such as Command and Control; Information Systems and targeting and reconnaissance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course across the Alliance it is ever more essential to ensure nations give priority those capabilities NATO needs. I commend the NATO Smart Defence Initiative. The UK is a keen supporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="co-operation-in-austerity"&gt;Co-operation in Austerity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our economies and defence budgets are under pressure, the rationale for co-operation in these times of Defence austerity becomes ever stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, for example, to develop our Combined Joint Expeditionary Force. We hope the CJEF will be up and running by 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French and British units and ships have been undertaking reciprocal training exercises as we continue to develop the new force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m told our forces - like the true professionals they are - operate very well together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there does appear to be some friendly rivalry over who has the best ration packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, collaboration is an important principle of our approach to Defence equipment and support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an efficient way of delivering a balanced and affordable equipment programme. It means we can look to exploit economies of scale when it  comes to harmonising British and French requirements and sharing overhead costs.. It also helps to boost export opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows us to maximise our capabilities - particularly when it comes to sharing technologies, and it allows us to spread the cost - and the risk - of research and acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course in the case of the UK-France partnership all of these factors also support interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with France is not detrimental to our national sovereignty, provided that we retain operational advantage and freedom of action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our view is that it can help to consolidate our equipment programme and sustain aspects of our operational advantage and freedom of action.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK we spend around 40% of the nation’s defence budget every year - a figure of around £13 billion - on equipment acquisition, support and technology.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By getting together we can make this money - and indeed both our budgets - go further.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do have the spending power - together the UK and France account for around 50% of European spending on defence.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense for us to collaborate. Work together and plan together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we have to look ahead, horizon scan and develop capabilities to meet future challenges… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why Research and Technology is an area where investment is absolutely key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commitment to an annual target of 50 million Euros each from the UK and France on joint research shows we’re serious about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in particular when it comes to critical technologies where the market, civil or defence, may not be sufficiently strong to meet UK and France defence needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be looking to industry to work with us on this - we need their expertise when it comes to identifying vulnerabilities. As well as spotting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya and Afghanistan demonstrated the usefulness of Unmanned Air Systems, more commonly known as drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month’s UK-France summit committed us to taking forward our planned cooperation on UAS.  In the longer term these will develop into unmanned combat air systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint funding and interdependence should help sustain industrial capability and deliver cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another programme is A400M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is taking delivery of this transport aircraft in 2013 and we in the UK get ours in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re developing a common support plan - including spare parts for our future fleets of these aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="challenges"&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK-France project is a mature cooperation between democratic nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore we can be open about areas of disagreement and where we have different agendas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the UK has preferred to look to NATO first and then the EU, whereas France has leaned towards the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted when France rejoined the NATO military structures in 2009 and became a full player in that vital organisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been significant convergence between our national positions over the years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the French preparatory work for their next Livre Blanc shows a balance between multi-lateral engagement with the EU and NATO, and bilateral engagement with key partners such as the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the publication of that document in the month after the elections will set the strategic direction for France on a whole range of issues.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bigger challenge for European nations is not should our forces work under NATO or the EU but how do we maintain capable forces? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will no doubt be the subject of some lively debate for those taking part in this morning’s workshop .    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="making-it-work"&gt;Making it Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK we have changed our institutional architecture to support the deepening of our bilateral relationship with France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our International Policy France team in the Ministry of Defence provides us with a central hub covering a range of activity - from equipment and procurement to political and military cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yesterday evening it was my pleasure to announce that the defence staff in our embassy here in Paris now have a new name: British Defence Staff-France.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a move which acknowledges the  increase in the Exchange and Liaison Footprint in France, as well as the Defence Section here in Paris. &lt;br&gt;
This is a highly symbolic move.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one other British Embassy across the world which has been accorded similar status, and that is our Defence presence in Washington - known as British Defence Staff - US.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new organisation recognises this change in dynamic and will be a ‘one shop’ stop, co-ordinating the expanding areas of activity and development across our partnership.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will include taking forward our portfolio of co-operative equipment programmes.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a significant move, and reflects the UK’s commitment to a partnership which is dynamic, and rapidly gathering pace.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winston Churchill said that ‘difficulties mastered are opportunities won’.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that ethos is - I believe - what our defence relationship - is all about.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about working together on the challenges we face.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding and exploiting opportunities in more areas where we can work together in a smarter, more cost effective way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may always be differences in our styles or our methods.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is invariably true of any successful partnership.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These differences will often play to the particular strengths of each country. To the way we complement; balance and develop our defence capabilities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is going to be very important - and what I know we can achieve - is harmonisation of approach. Three areas in particular are vital to ensuring that we work successfully together over the longer term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political commitment: we will continue to signal the importance that both Governments attach to the defence relationship;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-operation between our Armed Forces; a combined Joint Expeditionary Force is a sign of progress but co-operation needs to be embedded throughout the two organisations and in military doctrine;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint investment in research and technology; this is essential in creating the future capabilities for fighting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference is a really useful chance to stocktake, challenge some of our assumptions and assess progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for one am looking forward to ‘having my feet held to the fire’ this morning when I chair the  workshop which I see has the  slightly ominous title of ‘Franco-British Defence Co-operation: the balance sheet’.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you. And now, the floor is yours - any questions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>RFA Wave Knight returns from 11-month deployment</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wave Knight was welcomed home on Friday 16 March by loved ones of the ship’s company which was made up of RFA personnel as well as some Royal Navy and Fleet Air Arm personnel in support of her 815 Naval Air Squadron Lynx flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since leaving the UK, the fleet tanker has supported the international naval mission in the Middle East, providing fuel and other supplies to sustain the ongoing fight against piracy and other criminal activities in those troubled waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tanker’s time away from the UK has been devoted to supporting the international naval effort east of Suez, providing fuel for coalition ships and aircraft, but also carrying out ‘front line duties’ on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship escorted P&amp;amp;O cruise ships Oriana and Arcadia through pirate-prone waters as hundreds of passengers stood on deck excitedly waving flags in acknowledgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wave Knight also successfully co-ordinated the rescue of the crew of a stricken pleasure craft - the Princess Melisa. The vessel had issued a mayday distress call and was capsizing off the coast of Oman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFA Wave Knight’s Commanding Officer, Captain Chris Clarke, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst it is always a pleasure to return home, we shall miss the work and daily uncertainty that is ever-present when operating East of Suez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You never know what each day will bring - other than the unexpected. It is likely to occur and you have got to be ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The work we do for the maritime community and the support we provide to our Government and our allies is always appreciated - whether that is providing logistic support, reassuring ships on the high seas, deterring and preventing illegal activities such as piracy or simply being ready and poised to react to geopolitical events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her 11 months away, the ship steamed 57,460 miles (87,000 km) and replenished 56 warships and five tankers, issuing over 21,000 cubic metres of diesel fuel and 2,000 cubic metres of aviation fuel in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Clarke added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As ever, none of what we have achieved would have been possible without the dedication and professionalism of the ship’s company or without the support of so many family, friends and working colleagues at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We dedicate this homecoming to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/03/16 - A UK-France Vision Of The Future of The European Aerospace Industry</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon messieurs et dames, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you [Laurent Collet-Billon] for that kind introduction.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My visit to Bordeaux this week has been a great chance to catch up with friends and colleagues.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am especially pleased to see some familiar faces here - and some new ones - from industry especially from this side of the Channel. Some of you may well have attended the Anglo-French Industry day last July.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together - at every level, Ministers, Chiefs, Officials and industry - means we are developing a very real understanding at every level.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An understanding of our mutual priorities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as a commitment to continue to explore areas of potential collaboration.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Britain, we spend around 40% of our Defence budget every year, or around £13 billion, on equipment acquisition, support and technology.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement with industry is at the heart of our defence posture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday’s High Level Working Group was an opportunity to review our progress on the growing number of areas in which we are now collaborating.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portfolio of Franco-British programmes sets out to deliver a wide range of capabilities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some extent we are drawing on each others strengths. And aiming to avoid duplicating capabilities where we don’t need to.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treaty also makes clear the need to improve access to each other’s markets, and to explore new opportunities to become available to both sets of industries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has also provided a welcome opportunity to visit an area which is home to a world leading aviation sector.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really is no substitute for getting out on site and visiting industry at work. When Napoleon said we were a nation of shopkeepers, perhaps he was referring to the industry shop floor.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My trips to EADS, Thales and Dassault Aviation yesterday afternoon were fascinating. This has proved to be a highly informative, productive and enjoyable visit on a number of levels.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hosts have also very kindly given me the opportunity to learn about Bordeaux’s other world famous - and rather more historic -industry. I am of course referring here to your fabulous wine.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uk-france-defence-co-operation-treaty---and-why-it-matters"&gt;UK-France Defence Co-operation Treaty - and why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have been reminded - as I so often am these days - that we are natural partners, who share similar aspirations and budgets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk to you briefly about this Defence Partnership. About why it matters, and about what it means for your sector - Aerospace.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, last year’s operations in Libya really did show once and for all that when it comes to Defence the UK and France are - in the words of President Sarkozy - the ‘heavy lifters’ of Europe.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation Unified Protector showed the world that we have assets we can - and will - deploy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do that, I believe, because we share the same values and global interests.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the same responsibilities. As members of the UN Security Council. And as leaders in the EU and NATO.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to our financial commitment to Defence, I believe the facts speak for themselves.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together France and the UK account for nearly half of Europe’s Defence spending.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-operation means we can make this money go a lot further. It means boosting capabilities. Ensuring interoperability, and working to each others strengths and sustaining world leading defence industries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means we can look to exploit economies of scale by buying or developing equipment with France. Or sharing facilities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are opportunities that we must continue to explore.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these tough times, as our Defence Secretary recently said, there can be no security without economic stability.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us in the UK co-operation also means saving money for our hard pressed tax payers as we work hard  to make sure our Defence equipment programme is affordable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="this-weeks-ndi-conference---uk-france-treaty-sme-opportunities"&gt;This week’s NDI Conference - UK-France Treaty: SME opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And co-operation brings opportunities for those of you here from industry.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you here today are from SMEs. Welcome to you all. You are a sector we in the UK are very keen to encourage.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to open up Defence as a market and make the MOD a more accessible customer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I attended the annual conference of the NDI -one of the UK’s leading Defence  industry organisations, with a membership of over 200 companies.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to see that an important part of the conference was dedicated to discussing opportunities for Small and medium sized enterprises - known as SMEs - offered by the UK-France Defence Co-operation Treaty. You are businesses which we in the UK are keen to encourage.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly pleased to see that the French Ambassador to the UK spoke at the conference with passion and persuasiveness, of the importance of Franco-British cooperation, and the fact that the relationship will endure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend this kind of initiative. Enhanced Franco-British cooperation offers just as great opportunities for SMEs -  particularly on the supply chain side - as it does for primes.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because SMEs bring innovation and agility.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We in the UK have seen that special added value when it comes to getting urgent operational requirements out to our Forces on the front line in Afghanistan.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMEs have played - and continue to play - an important role in this.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uas---unmanned-air-systems"&gt;UAS - Unmanned Air Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And SMEs are of course essential to making sure we continue to push forward the boundaries in a sector like aerospace. Where the ability to exploit new and emerging technologies will be absolutely vital.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential here is - I believe - hugely exciting.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unmanned Air Systems are now an absolutely crucial asset. Both in today’s  battle space. And as a vital capability for the future.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know this from our operations in Afghanistan.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again of course Libya was another example.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month’s UK-France Summit committed us to taking forward our planned co-operation on UAS within a long term partnership framework  that encompasses the different levels.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From tactical to Medium Altitude Long Endurance  - MALE - in the mid term. And Unmanned combat Air systems in the longer term.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint funding and interdependence should help sustain industrial capability and deliver cost savings. Work is proceeding at pace and industry input will be important.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On MALE we now have a joint office in Bristol and our next step will be to advance the jointly funded risk reduction studies for the MALE. We will look to take further decisions after the outcomes of the study.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say a word here about Watchkeeper.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome French interest in acquiring this Unmanned Aerial capability, and we are looking at opportunities to organise trials in France next year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think both sides agree there is a lot of mutual benefit to be had when it comes to co-operating on this system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space, as they say.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="unmanned-combat-air-system"&gt;Unmanned Combat Air System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next couple of years are going to be very busy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will be a period of vital importance - I believe - when it comes to shaping the future of European Combat Air.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to when Rafale and Typhoon come out of service in the 2030+ timeframe, both the  UK and France will have a requirement to examine the options for the next generation of Combat Air Systems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong correlation has been found between UK and French needs and aspirations in the combat air sector.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common vision on the “Combat Air” sector has been shared -  and is being developed - between Governments.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should ensure that we have the necessary skills and technological capbilities to take development forward of this complex military air system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year we intend  the UK and France to undertake a joint Future Combat Air System Demonstration Programme.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pending national approvals and decisions points on both sides, we’ll be starting work as soon as possible on a specification for this demonstration.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a jointly funded contract under the industrial leadership of our national fighter aircraft industries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will need both an investment in the right technologies - and of course the skills required.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, those of you here today from industry have an important stake in this. Opportunities for business will exist across the supply chain and we will be looking to you for your support.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="complex-weapons"&gt;Complex weapons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now developing a 10 year strategic plan for the British and Fench Complex Weapons industries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our aim on this is to benefit from our common position on this sector when it comes to budgets, as well as similar military and industrial requirements.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A joint strategy will help us to consolidate our Complex Weapons industrial base.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as  help both countries to offer competitive products on the global market which will be essential to sustain a thriving industry.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this strategy forward will require a process of transformation across the industry as a whole in both countries.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBDA is providing the industry lead for the sector through what is known as the Centre of Excellence model.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a400m-transport-aircraft"&gt;A400M transport aircraft&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support and training are areas where collaboration can bring us tangible benefits.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at a project like the A400M transport aircraft, which is a great example.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial deliveries to France are expected in early 2013, with the first UK delivery due in September 2014.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re developing a common support plan - including for spare parts - for our future fleets of these transport aircraft.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An integrated support contract will be negotiated with Airbus Military before the arrival of the first French operational aircraft next year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also have a joint user group when it comes to co-operation on training.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-research--technology"&gt;The importance of Research &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already talked today about innovation as the key driver to developing the high-tech, battle winning solutions UK and French Forces will need in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of solutions which could well be deployed when our Combined Joint Expeditionary Force - and deployable Joint Force Headquarters - becomes operational in just a few years time.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why Research and Technology is an area where - as far as I am concerned - it is imperative that we continue to invest.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commitment to an annual target of 50 million Euros each from the UK and France on collaborative research and development shows we are serious about this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborative research of course also means that we need our top brains working together. I’m confident our new joint PHD programme will be a catalyst for this.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s essential that the UK start defining priority areas for this  research. And of course industry has an active and important role to play in this.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need you to be working with us. In identifying the gaps. Spotting the opportunities and coming up with solutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take an area such as Critical Technologies where commercial off the shelf technologies may not be sufficient to meet UK and France Defence needs.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why are already working on a joint plan to identify the key technologies both countries will need over the next 12 to 15 years.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is of course advancing all the time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have to do - Government, the military and industry - is to make sure we’re thinking creatively.  Again, this is something SMEs excel at. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no time to lose on this. We may not know what the future holds.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we do know it will remain uncertain.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to be prepared.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historic Defence Co-operation Treaty laid strong foundations for two great nations to work together in an area which is so important to the safety and security of us and future generations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now embarked on a wide range of ambitious programmes which - I believe - will ensure we are ready and able for the challenges of the 21st century.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will of course be looking to you - industry - to deliver. I know we can count on your energy and support in making this happen.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/03/14 - Building for Growth</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning. I’m delighted to be here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to David Bowles as NDI’s outgoing Chair. It’s been a pleasure working with you over the last couple of years David. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to your vision and leadership the NDI is a flourishing organisation with a growing membership and a great deal of influence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And welcome to your new Chairman, Mike Maiden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike, I’ve got to know you in your capacity as Deputy, and also through your contribution to my Defence Supplier Forum SME Group. I’m delighted you’ll be taking up the reins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your expertise and insights are always tremendously useful. NDI members and Defence have a busy agenda ahead. I for one am looking forward to some very interesting times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="work-of-cde"&gt;Work of CDE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Jonathan [Jonathan Byrne - Head of CDE - providing the opening address] for such a fascinating insight into the work of CDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work you’re doing - in reaching out to SMEs, entrepreneurs and the academic world - is playing a vital role in helping to promote innovation and widen our supplier base. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very keen for CDE to have a more prominent role when it comes to sourcing cutting edge solutions to some of the emerging challenges facing our Armed Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re looking at ways to make the organisation still more effective in its important work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very fitting that this conference is taking place during our national Science and Engineering Week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper we published last month emphasised the contribution - no, actually that’s too weak a word - the fundamental place that technology has in providing our defence and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations like CDE and DSTL - our Defence Science and Technology Laboratory - are playing a vital role in promoting the contribution science and engineering make to Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And indeed industry across the board is too, in particular when it comes to SMEs. More and more the technology we need is being developed outside defence - by people like you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to understand it, and how to use it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we - the MOD - have to facilitate this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means getting to grips with some of our procurement processes.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making them more transparent, consistent and streamlined will help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really need to get cracking on cutting through a lot of the red tape enveloping a large organisation like the MOD. And we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be talking later about how measures outlined in our White Paper ‘Defence Through Technology’ will be overcoming some of these obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="role-of-the-ndi"&gt;Role of the NDI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted that Lockheed Martin and HITEK among others have chosen to sponsor this important event. The NDI is an organisation with clout - and certainly from my point of view as a Defence Minister you are important stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDI is - I believe - a really good example of an energetic and proactive industry hub supporting its members with a range of consultancy and project management interventions designed to create business opportunities. Now that sounds like a direct lift from the NDI website, but it is one I am happy to reiterate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does a superb job in representing its members and championing Defence and its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDI works with the Primes, and brings the major players and smaller companies together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, it gives those of you here from SMEs a voice and a platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NDI members I meet tell me that what they really appreciate is the fact that this is an organisation which is membership focused at grass roots level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you keep your members in touch with a dynamic and evolving market. Whether it’s spreading the word about new and emerging opportunities, or developments in a particular sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course organising major events such as this year’s conference which brings together a range of industry sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad your theme is ‘Building for Growth’, which could be adopted as something of a motto for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased that speakers have been focusing in a very specific way on business opportunities. Because from our point of view I can tell you that the opportunities are there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not think so if you read some of the ill-informed comment in the national media, but Defence is big business. And will remain so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still in the process of reviewing our equipment programme, but we plan to continue to invest a significant amount in defence equipment and its support. This will be a figure of some £150 billion or more over the next decade.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful organisations like NDI will adapt and change. I know, for example, that you’re now focusing on Aerospace, Space and Security markets. But Defence remains the cornerstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I welcome the fact that the NDI is also keen to explore opportunities through the implementation of the Franco-British Treaty. I know that you heard something similar from the French Ambassador yesterday and I naturally endorse this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="franco---british-treaty-opportunities-and-smes"&gt;Franco - British Treaty: Opportunities and SMEs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to see that the NDI is taking a lead on this, by devoting an important part of this year’s conference to industry’s perspective on the business opportunities offered by the Treaty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the way, I particularly commend the way the NDI is actively building links with an organisation like Team Cote D’Azure. And for the more cynical among you, I am assured by NDI and my own officials that the defence industries are very strong in this agreeable part of France. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that Steve McCarthy, our Director General for International Security Policy at the Ministry of Defence, spoke to you about our relationship with France yesterday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater Franco-British cooperation should open up great opportunities for SMEs as it does for primes. The recent Summit highlighted many areas.  Over time I expect SMEs to do particularly well from our increasingly deep collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, a tremendous amount has already happened over the past year in our Defence partnership with France. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s been particularly striking is just what a turning point Libya was for us - the UK and France. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of further consolidating existing links between us. And also in the way we’ve been able to identify the sort of areas where we should now be prioritising our joint work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In key areas like command and control; information systems; intelligence; surveillance; targeting; as well as reconnaissance and precision munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, there’s now a lot of work going on between us across just about every area of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research and Technology is a good example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later today I’ll be heading over to Paris and on to Bordeaux -  another area of France perhaps better known for something other than its strong defence industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There the High Level Working Group will be briefed by industry on Critical Technologies, such as Radar Absorbent Material, Optronics and technologies used in manufacturing radars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a number of French SMEs attending the conference in Bordeaux, and it’s going to be extremely useful to hear their views on how we here in the UK can take forward industry’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France and the UK continue to account for nearly half of Europe’s Defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-operation on equipment makes compelling  sense for both countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - It allows both of us - the UK and France - to maximise our already considerable purchasing power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second - it enhances interoperability.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third - Bilateral collaboration is an important principle of today’s UK Defence equipment programme. It helps to sustain a strong industrial base. And underpins both British and French security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course that opens up more opportunities for you on both sides of the Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I particularly welcome NDI’s initiative in dedicating an important part of this event to exploring opportunities for SMEs in the UK and France to work together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defence-white-paper---the-offer-for-smes"&gt;Defence White Paper - the offer for SMEs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to extend a special welcome to SME who has joined us from France today.  This event is a great chance to network with a range of decision makers spanning commercial; operational and technical fields across industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s global market place SMEs are the life blood of any successful industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is definitely true when it comes to the Defence industry. As the success of our Urgent Operational Requirements  process demonstrates time and again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have been making a vital contribution when it comes to getting battle winning capability out to the front line in Afghanistan to meet the evolving threats our forces have faced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re able to be this responsive - I believe - because you have the innovation and the agility. You’re able to exploit new and emerging technologies which create solutions - very often in niche capabilities - and, crucially, are cost effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMEs have a vital role to play in making sure our Forces have the best kit and the best support. At the right price for the British tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk about why you matter to the MOD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why our recent MOD White Paper ‘Defence Through Technology’ commits us to a range of measures which are aimed at opening up more of our business to you. And making us a more accessible customer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically four strands to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - building on the work already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, for example, the MOD changed its policy to minimise the use of Pre-Qualification Questionnaires for low risk procurements under £100,000. A significant sum for many SMEs if not for the MOD itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department also now uses the Government’s Contract Finder portal to advertise requirements over £10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second - Successful implementation of the new measures we have signed up to in the White Paper itself. With a view to making the whole application process for smaller contractors more streamlined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to help you develop new products, and make sure you get the expert advice you need to help you export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways we’ll be doing this. For example, we will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopting an Open Procurement approach by ensuring individual procurement strategies maximise the potential for you at prime and sub-contract level. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making sure there’s an emphasis on ‘open systems’ factored in to our requirements. So that there’s scope for you to offer the kind of modular systems which enhance major weapons and platforms. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expanding our e-procurement system to speed up invoicing and billing. I know this is of particular benefit as far as SMEs are concerned. Cash flow is a critical factor for SMEs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third - We - the MOD - have to ensure these changes become part of the department’s DNA. This is as much about cultural change as changing rules and regulations. I am glad that NDI has already made some very good suggestions in this regard and I am grateful for this support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fourth - and final strand - of this activity is doing what we can to energise the Primes into becoming part of this drive.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, we are making progress. I wonder how many of you here today from the SME sector are aware of just how much MOD business comes your way? In fact, you’re currently winning 42% of MOD’s equipment contracts. In financial terms that’s around £1 billion of new business a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many more of you are contributing to Defence and Security programmes as subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know however that for many SMEs out there - and this is certainly something we’ve been hearing from the NDI - Defence appears to be a complex and bureaucratic customer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was definitely reflected in the feedback we had during our extensive consultations in the lead up to the White Paper. I believe the final paper reflects this, but you must let me know if not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defence-white-paper---open-procurement-approach"&gt;Defence White Paper - Open Procurement approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open procurement means that wherever possible we’ll be seeking to fulfil Defence requirements through open competition in the domestic and global market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent awarding of the MARS contract - the construction of four new ships for the Royal Navy - to Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) in South Korea is tangible evidence of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a number of British companies took part in the international competition - which was quite rightly initiated by the previous Government - none of them submitted a final bid for the build contract.  Of course I would have preferred it if there had been a competitive British bid. But there wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, we decided that the best option for Defence, and value for money for taxpayers, is for the tankers to be constructed in South Korea by DSME. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would just note by the way that there will also be up to £150 million of associated contracts for the MARS project. And again there have been opportunities here for SMEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open procurement also means buying off the shelf if that represents best value-for-money, as it often will. There is no reason why a competitive British defence industry shouldn’t win that business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we will be pragmatic. We have to protect our national security. And that is why the  White Paper also sets out our approach to maintaining the UK’s operational advantages and freedom of action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boosting our exports is another principle of the White Paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence exports give us leverage and influence - and enhance interoperability with the Armed Forces of close partners such as France and the US. And indeed NATO and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these times of austerity, exports may also have the benefit of reducing the cost of long term programmes, and removing some of the associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why exportability will be integral to our future equipment programmes. I’m confident this will help companies reach new markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Defence is a vibrant sector here in the UK. In fact, we’re the second largest Defence exporter in the world, with £6 billion of sales and a 22% share of the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m equally confident you’ll be able to win business here and overseas on your own merits. Indeed, building an open and competitive UK Defence sector is the best guarantee of the industry’s future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the EU single market increasingly extends to Defence and Security under the new procurement directive, the competitiveness and technological excellence of our industry in the UK, and SMEs in particular, will be a real strength for the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a key part of what I see as a real industrial policy for defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper is also about cultural change. Changes in MOD processes and the way we do business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why the Defence Equipment and Support organisation is also under review.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence transformation also means taking a long hard look at our processes, and the way we do business. It means upping our game when it comes to having the right skills in areas like financial and project management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means change for DE&amp;amp;S and the way it operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Materiel Strategy, as it is called, is being taken forward by Major General Chris Deverell on behalf of Bernard Gray, the Chief of Defence Materiel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five options have been considered as part of the Materiel Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we have pretty well already ruled out the status quo. And we will not be going down the privatisation route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves three options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option one: DE&amp;amp;S becomes a Government-owned, Contractor-operated set up - a GoCo - along the lines of the Atomic Weapons Establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option two: is for an Executive non-departmental public body with a Strategic Partner, similar to the Olympic Delivery Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, Option three: it becomes a trading fund along the lines of DSTL, the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the final decision, the review will need to factor in the need to improve skills and processes. And, crucially, ensure a more disciplined relationship between DE&amp;amp;S and MOD customers, including Front Line Commands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re determined to make some pretty bold decisions. And we’ll be as radical as we need to be - no more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is ongoing work, but there will be changes ahead. The MOD must - and will - become a more intelligent and demanding customer. This will be good for your competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defence-white-paper---a-commitment-to-st"&gt;Defence White Paper - a commitment to S&amp;amp;T&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked at some length about our approach to our equipment programme, and the principles we’ll be guided by as we work to ensure a balanced and affordable equipment programme in the years ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to make clear is that technology and innovation are absolutely central to this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something I feel pretty passionate about. It’s staggering to think that under the last Government, the Science and Technology budget more than halved between 1997 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was short sighted in the extreme. I’m determined that this process of decline must be stopped.  And it has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of spending on Science and Technology is now baselined at its current level of 1.2% of the overall Defence budget. This firm intent is clearly set out in our White Paper. And it’s another key component of an effective approach towards the Defence and Security industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sum is currently over £400 million a year. I’m hoping - not committing - that it will be possible for this figure to grow as a result of a well planned and sensibly managed equipment programme. Some of this will be from collaboration with our French colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sme-forum"&gt;SME Forum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Paper is a high-level guide which provides direction. For us in Defence, and you in industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a living document and we remain open to further measures and improvements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly when  it comes to SMEs. Which is why I’ve established a dedicated SME Forum to address your concerns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the NDI, membership also includes ADS; the Federation of Small Businesses; Engineering Employers Federation and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally chair these meetings. I find them a really valuable way of getting together with key representatives from industry to tackle some of the current issues and challenges we all face. And its not just trade bodies, but real SMEs also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SME Forum took part in the extensive consultation process which informed the White Paper. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank SME Forum members for their important contribution to that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad the White Paper was well received by industry, and I am grateful for that intelligent response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly delighted that the paper is acting as a catalyst for action by industry itself, led by bodies such as NDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference has focused on building for the future. Looking ahead, making plans, building capability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a future which looks increasingly unknowable. Where all sorts of eventualities will have to  be considered and planned for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where there will be new and emerging challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of which - and I’m thinking here of areas like Cyber, and Space - will also present opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am quite certain about, however, is that strong and effective partnerships - between us in the MOD and you in industry - will be vital when it comes to safeguarding our future and making sure our forces have battle winning capability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the fourth largest Defence budget in the world behind us I know we can - and will - continue to deliver on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all that you have done and will continue to do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Defence Secretary responds to criticism over Navy tankers order</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) tankers will maintain the Royal Navy’s ability to refuel at sea and will provide fuel to warships and task groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will support deployed amphibious, land and air forces close to the shore, will be able to operate helicopters, and are planned to enter service from 2016, replacing existing Royal Fleet Auxiliary single-hulled tankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, announced that Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) is the government’s preferred bidder for the £452m order of four of the MARS tankers and that they will be built by DSME in South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Hammond has responded to criticisms in the media that the contract has not been awarded to a UK company, or a company that would build the vessels in the UK, by sending a letter to the Daily Mail which has been published today. Here follows the full letter sent to the newspaper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No British firm put in a bid and the Italian company [Fincantieri] never indicated during the two-year bid process that they would build any of the tankers in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we are building complex warships or highly sophisticated weapons, of course we must protect Britain’s industrial base. But when it comes to non-military type equipment, I am clear that my responsibility is to get the best deal for the UK taxpayer and plough the savings back into the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this case, the choice we were faced with was to buy South Korean and save hundreds of millions of pounds for the taxpayer, or let the work to an Italian shipyard. I believe we made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
