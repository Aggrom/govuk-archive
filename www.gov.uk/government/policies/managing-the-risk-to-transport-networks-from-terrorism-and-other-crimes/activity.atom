    <title>Security requirements for moving dangerous goods by road and rail</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses involved in the carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail for national and international journeys are required to take security measures to safeguard against acts of terrorism in accordance with chapter 1.10 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/adr_e.html"&gt;European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (&lt;abbr title="European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road"&gt;ADR&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.otif.org/en/publications/rid-2011.html"&gt;Appendix C of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail&lt;/a&gt;, Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (&lt;abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail"&gt;RID&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-requirements"&gt;The requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulation 5 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1348/contents/made"&gt;Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009&lt;/a&gt; (and as amended) apply the security provisions of &lt;abbr title="European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road"&gt;ADR&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail"&gt;RID&lt;/abbr&gt; for national journeys. Regulations 7 and 8 also contain additional security requirements for Great Britain. These regulations are subject to agreed derogations as set out in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/cdg-approved-derogations-and-transitional-provisions/"&gt;Carriage of Dangerous Goods: Approved Derogations and Transitional Provisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security requirements are split between two levels. A general level is applicable to all dangerous goods and requires that they shall only be offered to people, companies or organisations that have been appropriately identified, temporary storage sites shall be properly secured, drivers shall carry a means of photographic identification and security training awareness shall be provided. A higher level applies for high consequence dangerous goods and requires that a security plan is adopted, implemented and complied with. High consequence dangerous goods are defined as those which have the potential for misuse in a terrorist incident and which may, as a result, produce serious consequences such as mass casualties or mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements do not apply to the carriage of civil nuclear material as defined by the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (&lt;abbr title="Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003"&gt;NISR&lt;/abbr&gt;). The transport of such material and non nuclear radioactive material is regulated by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/transport/index.htm"&gt;Office for Nuclear Regulation&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with &lt;abbr title="Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003"&gt;NISR&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="road-and-rail-guidance-documents"&gt;Road and rail guidance documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;) published guidance when the security requirements originally came into force in July 2005 to help you determine which measures you should apply in order to comply with the security requirements. This guidance is currently being reviewed and updated and will appear here in the near future. If in the mean time you have any enquiries regarding the security requirements please contact the department using the contact details below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should consider the planning system when putting in new physical security measures - the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/wps/portal/portalhome/unauthenticatedhome/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjtxBnJydDRwMLbzdLA09nSw_zsKBAIwN3U_1wkA6zeHMXS4gKd29TRwNPI0s3b2e_AGMDAwOIvAEO4Gig7-eRn5uqX5CdneboqKgIAGUwqho!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh"&gt;planning portal&lt;/a&gt; website includes a planning guide for small businesses that will help you determine whether planning permission is required&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compliance with security requirements should be considered in conjunction with developing your &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/business-continuity"&gt;business continuity plan&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has produced a security training film for drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods; managers and employers of those drivers; and depot staff having responsibilities for communications with those drivers whilst on the road - please use our ‘Application form’  to apply for a copy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please also use our ‘Security film notes for trainers’  which support the dangerous goods road security training film&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Serious Organised Crime Agency and UK Border Agency have produced a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.soca.gov.uk/news/345-soca-a-uk-border-agency-joint-campaign-on-lorry-crime"&gt;Lorry Crime Prevention Booklet&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on preventing illegal immigration across the Channel but which reinforces &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s transport security messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="enforcement-of-the-requirements"&gt;Enforcement of the requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Office for Nuclear Regulation enforce the security requirements of &lt;abbr title="European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road"&gt;ADR&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail"&gt;RID&lt;/abbr&gt; in Great Britain.

    <title>Regulation of aviation security</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am publishing a summary of responses to the government’s consultation on better regulation for aviation security, and announcing the government’s decision on taking forward the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation document &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21/"&gt;Better regulation for aviation security&lt;/a&gt; set out proposals to modernise the regulatory regime for aviation security to bring it into line with better regulation principles, promote innovation and efficiency and ensure the best possible passenger experience. It proposed a move to an Outcome Focused Risk Based (&lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt;) approach which would give operators the flexibility and responsibility to design security processes that deliver specified security outcomes, perhaps more focussed towards the needs of their passengers, rather than requiring them, as at present, to comply with prescriptive security requirements. It builds on the successful and similar approach that now applies in aviation safety regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to an &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; approach would be managed through the introduction of a Security Management System (&lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt;) developed and operated by each responsible organisation. A &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; is an organised, systematic approach to managing security which embeds security management into the day-to-day activities of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will begin with a series of &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; pilots, starting at London City Airport once the Olympics have finished, in which industry operators will develop the &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; approach and in so doing enhance their internal security cultures. The pilot at London City Airport will be concerned only with the organisation and governance of security at the airport, not with the security checks themselves, which will continue to be managed and delivered in the current way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once these pilots have been concluded, and we are satisfied that the &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; process is sufficiently robust and will deliver its intended benefits, we shall look to roll it out generally across the industry. This will provide a sound basis for the development and piloting of the &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation ran from 14 July until 7 November 2011. Some 116 responses were received, from a range of organisations and individuals in the aviation industry as well as from interested bodies. I am grateful to them for the time they took in responding and for their informed and constructive comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to say that there was overwhelming support for the proposed new approach. In publishing the consultation the government acknowledged that these are complex proposals which require further development. The responses have been helpful in clarifying some of the issues involved, including importantly the proposed timetable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation proposed that the new arrangements should be phased in over three years starting in April 2013. The Civil Aviation Bill, which is currently before parliament, provides for various aviation security functions that are currently performed by the Department for Transport to be conferred on the Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;). Subject to the date of royal assent, we are preparing for the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; to take on those functions from April 2014. The &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; proposals would represent a significant change in the approach to the regulation of aviation security. We have therefore decided that development and roll-out of &lt;abbr title="Security Management System"&gt;SeMS&lt;/abbr&gt; is the right first step to take towards the roll-out of the &lt;abbr title="Outcome Focused Risk Based"&gt;OFRB&lt;/abbr&gt; approach. The &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; has been consulted and supports this decision. The conferring of functions on the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; does not depend on this development being completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary report, with further information about our plans for implementing the new approach, will be available in the libraries of both houses and on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The changing face of disclosure and barring</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that good safeguarding practices should involve more than just a criminal record check, such as rigorous reference checking and face-to-face interviews, on-going training and day-to-day management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While as an employer you are best placed to maintain safeguarding practice on the ground, from September 2012, the government is scaling back the criminal records and barring systems to ‘common sense’ levels whilst ensuring that they continue to provide effective safeguarding. These changes will impact on organisations across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and it is important for employers to understand what the impact of these changes might be in their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important changes will be to reduce the numbers of people requiring criminal record checks by reducing regulated activity and scrapping controlled activity. This means that criminal records checks will only be mandatory for those working in close and unsupervised contact with vulnerable groups including children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Home Office has produced a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/crime/disclosure-and-barring/"&gt;leaflet explaining these changes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as letting you know about other changes happening over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be a number of seminars on the changes during June and July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
