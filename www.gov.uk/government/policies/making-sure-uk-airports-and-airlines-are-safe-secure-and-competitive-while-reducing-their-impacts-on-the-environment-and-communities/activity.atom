    <title>CAA board members reappointed</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has reappointed 2 members of the Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;) board for second terms in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Gray and Michael Medlicott joined the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; as non-executive Members in November 2009 and February 2010 respectively. David Gray has particular expertise in economic regulation including a period at Ofgem, where he was responsible for gas and electricity price control reviews. Michael Medlicott has many years’ experience in the transport and tourism sectors, including senior roles in the airline and airport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will serve for second terms of 3 years each at their existing salaries of £22,000 per annum for a time commitment of 1 day per week, with additional remuneration for chairing committees and participation in appeals hearings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A successful, safe and efficient aviation sector is vital to the UK’s success on the global stage. These reappointments recognise the contributions that both individuals have made to ensuring the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; remains an effective, reforming regulator in what has been a challenging period for the aviation sector. I wish them well as they continue in these important roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for the regulation of civil aviation in the United Kingdom and is the government’s principal advisor on aviation matters. It has specific responsibility for aviation safety, consumer protection, airspace policy and the economic regulation of the industry. It is based mainly in London and Gatwick and has approximately 950 employees. The great majority of the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s funding comes from the charges it imposes on the industry, rather than the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both members were originally appointed following an open competition regulated by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The appointments were made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. They have both declared that they have undertaken no relevant political activity during the past 5 years and that they hold no other current public appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aviation permits</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-permit-regime-explained"&gt;The permit regime explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before operating to, from or within the United Kingdom, all foreign registered aircraft must be in possession of an operating permit issued by the Department for Transport’s International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division (&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt;) under the 2009 Air Navigation Order. This requirement extends to all scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo charters that are not covered by the provisions of the European market access regulations, and to flights carrying out aerial work (e.g. photography, parachuting, flight training). Foreign aircraft require also permits under the appropriate air navigation orders before operating to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and the UK overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before granting any operating permits for scheduled flights, &lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; ensures that the services are operating in conformity with the traffic rights and conditions provided under the UK’s bilateral air services arrangements negotiated with the airlines’ states. In the case of non-scheduled flights we seek reciprocity to ensure that UK airlines are allowed similar opportunities from the respective foreign authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; also ensures that a number of administrative arrangements are completed before an operating permit is granted. These require airlines to provide valid certificates that are recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on competency (ie air operators certificate), insurance, registration, aircraft airworthiness and noise and that aircraft are fitted with a recognised enhanced ground proximity warning system, airborne collision avoidance system and crews are aware of the UK Approach Ban requirements and comply with aerodrome operating minima requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, any airline operating aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of 10,000kgs or more in the United Kingdom must also have a security Direction (known as the Single Consolidated Direction (Aviation) 2010) served on them and so applicants applying for a permit that involves such an operation should also contact &lt;a href="mailto:surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="departmental-contacts"&gt;Departmental contacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to the Secretary of State for airline operating permits should be sent using the appropriate form to the Department for Transport at the address below at least 48 hours in advance of the first flight:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU Transport Council 29 October 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended the first Transport Council of the Cypriot Presidency in Luxembourg on Monday 29 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council reached general approach on two proposals to amend EU legislation allowing the enforcement of certain provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention within the EU. The Maritime Labour Convention was agreed in the International Labour Organisation in 2006, and ensures certain standards of working conditions for seafarers. The proposals will provide for enforcement to take place as part of the port state control regime. The Council now awaits the European Parliament’s opinion before making further progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council reached general approach on a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the allocation of slots, repealing Council Directive 95/93/EC, by qualified majority voting. Although the majority of the text is acceptable the UK was unable to support the general approach on the day, largely because of uncertainty as to how a number of detailed points will be resolved. However, I was able to successfully preserve key elements of the text which safeguard the current secondary trading of slots in the UK and I was able to narrow down the scope for member states to restrict slot trading within their territory in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council held a debate on a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roadworthiness testing for motor vehicles and their trailers. I intervened to express the UK’s serious concerns about the proposal. I argued that it would impose substantial costs in the UK, with negligible road safety benefits. I highlighted that the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee have issued an opinion that the proposal was against the principles of subsidiarity. I also argued that the Commission’s impact assessment failed to provide convincing evidence of road safety benefits overall. The UK’s concerns were echoed by a number of other Member States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council reached a political agreement on a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council. The political agreement is based on the general approach reached in June, and accepts some minor amendments proposed by the European Parliament. The proposal will now return to the European Parliament for a second reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council adopted a decision on provisional application of an agreement to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel of 6 experts will take forward vital work to examine how the UK’s status as a leading global aviation hub can be maintained, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State announced on 7 September that the Airports Commission would be chaired by Sir Howard Davies. Today the terms of reference for the Commission were announced alongside the appointment of the group of leading academics and aviation experts who will help Sir Howard.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aviation is vital to the UK economy and we need to have a long term aviation policy which meets the challenges of the future. Sir Howard and his team will now take forward this vitally important work for the Government and bring a much-needed fresh perspective to the debate.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Howard Davies, Airports Commission chairman, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am announcing a team with the range of skills and experience required to drive forward the important work the Commission is undertaking. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With open minds, we will take time to explore the evidence, consider the options and aim to develop a lasting solution to the nation’s aviation needs.   Our ambition is to do a thorough piece of work that will ensure aviation continues to support this country’s economic, social and environmental ambitions.
The experience of recent years shows we need a robust evidence base which has the support of a broad consensus of opinion. We aim to put the next government into a position in which rapid and implementable decisions can be soundly made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commissioners who will support Sir Howard Davies are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir John Armitt CBE, the former Chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority and former Chief Executive of Network Rail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Ricky Burdett, Professor of Urban Studies at the London School of Economics and director of the LSE Cities research centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivienne Cox, the former CEO and Executive Vice President of BP Alternative Energy and a former member of the BP Executive Management Team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Dame Julia King, Vice Chancellor of Aston University and a member of the Committee on Climate Change, with a background in the aerospace industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geoff Muirhead CBE, the former CEO of the Manchester Airport Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="commissions-terms-of-reference"&gt;Commission’s terms of reference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s terms of reference are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission will examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub; and it will identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should maintain a UK-wide perspective, taking appropriate account of the national, regional and local implications of any proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should engage openly with interested parties and members of the public, providing opportunities to submit evidence and proposals and to set out views relevant to its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should seek to engage with a range of stakeholders, including with local and devolved government as well as the Opposition, to build consensus in support of its approach and recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission should report no later than the end of 2013 on: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its assessment of the evidence on the nature, scale and timing of the steps needed to maintain the UK’s global hub status; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its recommendation(s) for immediate actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next five years – consistent with credible long term options;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assessments and recommendations in the Commission’s interim report should be underpinned by a detailed review of the evidence in relation to the current position in the UK with regard to aviation demand and connectivity, forecasts for how these are likely to develop, and the expected future pattern of the UK’s requirements for international and domestic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its assessments of potential immediate actions should take into account their economic, social and environmental costs and benefits, and their operational deliverability. It should also be informed by an initial high-level assessment of the credible long-term options which merit further detailed development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission should report no later than summer 2015 on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its assessment of the options for meeting the UK’s international connectivity needs, including their economic, social and environmental impact;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its recommendation(s) for the optimum approach to meeting any needs; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its recommendation(s) for ensuring that the need is met as expeditiously as practicable within the required timescale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission should base the recommendations in its final report on a detailed consideration of the case for each of the credible options. This should include the development or examination of detailed business cases and environmental assessments for each option, as well as consideration of their operational, commercial and technical viability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its final report in summer 2015, it should also provide materials, based on this detailed analysis, which will support the Government in preparing a National Policy Statement to accelerate the resolution of any future planning applications for major airports infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-short-biography-of-each-of-the-members"&gt;A short biography of each of the members&lt;/h3&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 7 September 2012, the government announced its intention to create an independent commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, to identify and recommend to government options for maintaining the UK’s status as a global aviation hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission’s role will be to identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term whilst maintaining a UK-wide perspective. The commission will need to ensure it undertakes a thorough assessment of all the issues by considering all relevant factors including the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits and where necessary, the operational and technical deliverability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission’s website is currently under development. More information will be provided in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Membership and terms of reference of the Airports Commission</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 7 September, the government announced its intention to create an independent commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, to identify and recommend to government options for maintaining the UK’s status as a global aviation hub. Following discussions with Sir Howard, the government is now in a position to announce the full membership and terms of reference for this body, which will be named the Airports Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In selecting members of the Airports Commission, the government worked with Sir Howard to identify individuals with a range of skills, backgrounds and experience. The commission also intends to appoint a panel of expert advisors, to enhance its capability to address issues that fall outside of the direct experience of the commissioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Sir Howard Davies, the full membership of the commission includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sir John Armitt, the former Chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority and former Chief Executive of Network Rail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professor Ricky Burdett, Professor of Urban Studies at the London School of Economics and director of the LSE Cities research centre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vivienne Cox, the former CEO and Executive Vice President of BP Alternative Energy and a former member of the BP Executive Management Team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professor Dame Julia King, Vice Chancellor of Aston University and a member of the Committee on Climate Change, with a background in the aerospace industry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Geoff Muirhead CBE, the former CEO of the Manchester Airport Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission’s terms of reference will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission will examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub; and it will identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should maintain a UK-wide perspective, taking appropriate account of the national, regional and local implications of any proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should engage openly with interested parties and members of the public, providing opportunities to submit evidence and proposals and to set out views relevant to its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should seek to engage with a range of stakeholders, including with local and devolved government as well as the opposition, to build consensus in support of its approach and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission should report no later than the end of 2013 on: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its assessment of the evidence on the nature, scale and timing of the steps needed to maintain the UK’s global hub status; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its recommendation(s) for immediate actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next 5 years – consistent with credible long term options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assessments and recommendations in the commission’s interim report should be underpinned by a detailed review of the evidence in relation to the current position in the UK with regard to aviation demand and connectivity, forecasts for how these are likely to develop, and the expected future pattern of the UK’s requirements for international and domestic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its assessments of potential immediate actions should take into account their economic, social and environmental costs and benefits, and their operational deliverability. It should also be informed by an initial high-level assessment of the credible long-term options which merit further detailed development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission should report no later than summer 2015 on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its assessment of the options for meeting the UK’s international connectivity needs, including their economic, social and environmental impact;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its recommendation(s) for the optimum approach to meeting any needs; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its recommendation(s) for ensuring that the need is met as expeditiously as practicable within the required timescale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission should base the recommendations in its final report on a detailed consideration of the case for each of the credible options. This should include the development or examination of detailed business cases and environmental assessments for each option, as well as consideration of their operational, commercial and technical viability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its final report in summer 2015, it should also provide materials, based on this detailed analysis, which will support the government in preparing a National Policy Statement to accelerate the resolution of any future planning applications for major airports infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guild of Travel Management Companies conference</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction Ian (Ian Taylor - travel writer/journalist and conference host).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also to everyone at the Guild for asking me along, it’s a genuine pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cant-and-wont-ignore-the-facts"&gt;Can’t and won’t ignore the facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not sure if there are any fans of the “Yes Minister” TV series in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you too young to remember, “Yes Minister” was the 1980s version of “The Thick of it” but without the four letter words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s one scene where the civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby, says of the Minister Jim Hacker - “if he can’t ignore the facts he’s no business being a politician.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, based on that definition of politics I’m definitely in the wrong profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because, when it comes to the relationship between Britain’s transport system and Britain’s business travellers I can’t, and I won’t, ignore the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the facts are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;today we have to earn our living and pay our way in a fast moving global economy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a global economy in which this Association’s members face cut-throat competition. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a global economy where the state of your transport system can be the difference between missing a meeting or making a deal…between winning a contract or losing a customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I have to tell you that those facts have not been lost on the countries we compete against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They know that creaking and crumbling transport links are a business burden that cost time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look around the world - the evidence is there in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From North America to Latin America, and from our continental neighbours to the emerging economic powers of China and India, nation after nation is upgrading and expanding their transport infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bridge they construct, every road they repair and every track they lay is a boost for their businesses and their economies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we really don’t have the luxury of sitting back and looking on while our rivals invest in world class transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are our competition in the international marketplace, the economies we’re up against in a race to win the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if we’re going to out-produce, out-innovate and out-sell them, we cannot afford to be left behind in the starting blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="status-quo---latin-for-the-mess-were-in"&gt;Status quo - Latin for the mess we’re in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s something this guild and its members understand only too well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know better than anyone that ours is a trading nation, as well as an island nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nation where what we sell in Boston or Shanghai is just as important as what we make in Bristol or Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the reason you have consistently called for a transport system that is high quality and high performance - one that helps, not hinders, our business travellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I want you to know that we hear what you say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And trust me…those aren’t just warm words from a minister. The record proves that this is an issue where we are on your side and in your corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the minute we took office, this government made it clear that maintaining the transport status quo was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, as someone once said, “status quo is simply Latin for the mess we’re in”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, that translation has more than a ring of transport truth about it because frankly, we didn’t just inherit a financial deficit back in May 2010, we inherited an infrastructure deficit too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s precisely why we took the deliberate decision to focus time, effort and resources on making Britain’s transport networks fit for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ll admit that the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; hasn’t enjoyed its best media coverage lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious matters like the west coast mainline bid tend to generate serious headlines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also demand a serious response - which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger transport picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, I can say with absolute conviction that there has been real success and welcome progress on many of the transport issues that matter most to the people you represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="renewing-and-rebuilding-the-railways"&gt;Renewing and rebuilding the railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the way we’re renewing and rebuilding the railways that so many of your members use and rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re engaged in a massive modernisation effort. And just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to electrify more than 850 miles of track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, right across the country, we’re making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our focus doesn’t begin and end with the conventional railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like this guild, the government recognise the huge benefits of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, just like you, we also know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re committed to building with HS2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only links London and Birmingham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS2 will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make no mistake, the government is determined to push this project across the finishing line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="first-class-highways"&gt;First class highways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, business travellers don’t just need top-notch railways - they also need first rate highways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve been investing in this country’s roads and motorways too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cutting congestion by removing bottlenecks and tackling pinch points on vital corridors like the M5 and the M27&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using innovations like hard shoulder running and managed motorways to unlock capacity on crucial arteries like the M1 and the M25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;even supporting the uptake of electric cars with a nationwide network of re-charging points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this, and more, is designed to help motorists here and now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve also been thinking carefully about the key long-term challenges by undertaking a major Feasibility Study: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking at how we can best secure new investment capital &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reviewing new models of ownership and financing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and weighing up the most effective and efficient ways to maintain and modernise our strategic road network &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today and tomorrow - modern highways for a modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our vision, and that’s what we’re working hard to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="aviation"&gt;Aviation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spoken about rail and road, let me now turn a subject that rarely fails to generate debate and discussion - aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity, air travel has shrunk our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons - personal and business &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s little wonder that issues like airport capacity and connectivity are high on the agenda for this guild and its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as the minister responsible for aviation, my response is the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m with you - aviation is a big deal. It matters, it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me quickly walk you through some of the things being done to make sure the aviation sector is successful and sustainable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re steering the Civil Aviation Bill through Parliament - legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re just about to finish consulting on our draft Aviation Policy Framework- a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase reliability and reduce delays we’ve been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, from electrifying rail tracks to building new rail links, we’re improving the connections between the train and the plane at airports like Stansted and Cardiff, Luton and Manchester, Birmingham and Heathrow, Gatwick and Coventry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all global gateways to new markets and new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’re all set to become much easier places to get to, and fly from, when you’re travelling on business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thinking ahead too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about the future as just the next 4, 5, 6 years - but in terms of the next 4, 5 and 6 decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacity, connectivity, hub status - aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about how to meet those challenges, including this Guild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’ve asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission to consider the connectivity needs of the UK, and to make recommendations to government on how those needs can be met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I expect that Sir Howard will soon be setting out further details on the membership of the Commission and its work, including how he intends engaging with interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to the issue of the UK’s aviation capacity and we believe that Sir Howard Davies’ Commission is the way to do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, the Commission is in its early stages, but we are convinced that it will deliver and help us to maintain the UK’s hub status. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wi-fi"&gt;Wi-fi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one last area I want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the usual “planes, trains and automobiles” stuff of business travel. But, in today’s internet driven world, it’s perhaps just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about Wi-fi connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern business traveller doesn’t just ply their trade in face to face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a smart phone, a lap-top or the latest touch-screen tablet they work on the move, they work at home and they work outside of normal office hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that makes fast and reliable Wi-fi connections a business must, a business essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know it. Your members know it. And I’m pleased to be able to tell you that this government knows it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made broadband one of our top infrastructure priorities and published a National Broadband Strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up a “Broadband Delivery UK” team in Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve given that team £530 million to help bring superfast broadband to homes and businesses across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve announced a special £100 million fund to help ten major cities become “super-connected cities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This country’s Britain’s business travellers deserve world class Wi-fi connections, as well world class transport connections - and we’re working hard to delver both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Britain’s transport networks are its arteries of trade, then this guild’s members are surely the heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our business travellers - clocking up the miles, putting in the hard graft, making sure that Britain is always open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before I conclude, I just wanted to pay tribute to the work you do and the difference you make - this minister and this government recognise, value and appreciate everything you’re doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, having started off with a quote from a British comedy, I’d liked to finish off with one by an American President - Harry Truman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Truman once offered the following advice on public speaking - “If you can’t convince ‘em, confuse ‘em.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I hope that in speaking to you today I’ve been more convincing than confusing. I’ve certainly enjoyed having this chance to come along and talk about some of the things we’re doing to support the crucial work you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thank you for you time. I thank you for listening. And I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>EU Transport Council 29 October 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will attend the first Transport Council of the Cypriot Presidency (the Presidency) in Luxembourg on Monday 29 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency hopes to achieve general approach on 3 proposals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the allocation of slots, repealing Council Directive 95/93/EC. The proposed regulation has been subject to intense official-level scrutiny by Council Working Groups and these discussions are ongoing. Progress to date has been mixed, but the proposition remains acceptable from a UK perspective. I believe that the resulting regulation could help promote the most effective use of airport slots and build on the existing transparent, market-based approach to encourage the more efficient use of scarce capacity at congested airports, while minimising administrative and financial burdens for industry. However, at this stage, it remains unclear whether or not it will be possible to seek a general approach at the October Council.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the enforcement of certain provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention by flag states. The proposed general approach represents a satisfactory outcome for the UK and I will support it as it allows appropriate flexibility to member states, and will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on flag state responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The third is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2009/16/EC on port state control. I will support the proposal which will not require the UK to make any substantive changes to its proposed implementation of the provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention on port state responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An orientation debate will be held on a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roadworthiness testing for motor vehicles and their trailers (first reading). The UK strongly supports the ongoing roadworthiness testing of vehicles as a worthwhile contribution to road safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the UK is very concerned by the potential cost burden of the European Commission’s proposal as it is currently framed. The UK alone has identified costs of over €1 billion without any discernable benefit in road safety. We have also identified significant administrative burdens embedded in the proposal that similarly would produce no road safety benefit. In the current economic climate the UK does not wish to see any additional cost to European citizens, businesses or governments unless clearly justified by road safety benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency will be seeking a political agreement on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council (first reading). The UK supports the proposal which strikes a sensible balance between improving the security of the tachograph whilst ensuring that additional burdens on industry and enforcement authorities are minimised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council will be expected to adopt a proposal for a Council decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the agreement providing a general framework for enhanced cooperation between the European Union and the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol). The UK supports the proposed agreement. It is important that the significant work Eurocontrol performs on behalf of the European Union is put on a sound contractual and financial basis to help ensure value for money from the proposed €40 million expenditure over 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>United Kingdom forward programme of possible bilateral air services talks</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;International air services (apart from services within the European Union) are governed by the provisions of inter-governmental instruments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These instruments are usually in the form of air services agreements (ASA) - which are formal treaties between countries - accompanying Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and exchanges of formal diplomatic notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Any air carriers or other parties with an interest in these talks should contact the Department for Transport on the numbers shown in this publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
