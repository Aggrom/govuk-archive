    <title>Social housing sales in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of existing social housing stock in England for 2011 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social housing sales include sales under right to buy, preserved right to buy, right to acquire, social homebuy, other outright or shared equity sales to tenants, and sales of existing stock to the private sector. The figures exclude sales through low cost home ownership schemes where these do not relate to existing social stock, i.e. sales of newly built homes for shared ownership or acquisitions of private sector homes for affordable home ownership. Intra-tenure transfers between social housing providers are also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 9,670 total social housing sales in England in 2011-12. This is an increase of 15% on 2010-11 but continues the low level of sales seen since 2008-09. The increase was entirely due to an increase in private registered provider sales; local authority sales were virtually unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 3,720 right to buy sales in England in 2011-12 (38% of all sales), a 1% increase from 2010-11. Most (70%) right to buy sales were of local authority properties. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average market value of a local authority property purchased through right to buy in 2011-12 was £100,040. Average capital receipts were £73,350 and the average discount was £26,690 per property. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Registered provider sales in 2011-12 included 140 properties sold through the right to acquire scheme (compared to 200 in 2010-11) and 40 through social homebuy (compared to 110 in 2010-11).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 3,320 sales (34% of total sales) were disposals of registered provider properties to the private sector. Other shared equity and outright sales of existing stock accounted for the remaining sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate to right to buy sales by local authorities and registered providers. The statistics include sales under the right to buy and preserved right to buy schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Right to buy sales in England: 2012 to 2013 - quarters 1 and 2</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of dwellings under the right to buy scheme, as well as providing statistics on receipts resulting from those sales, and starts on site as part of the one-for-one replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 444 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 1. In this quarter local authorities received £24 million from right to buy sales, while 14 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 1,043 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 2. In this quarter local authorities received £62 million from right to buy sales, while 234 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate only to sales by local authorities under the right to buy scheme, excluding sales by registered providers under preserved right to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Multi-million pound boost will help buyers onto the housing ladder</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time buyers will from today benefit from a multi-million pound boost to help them onto the housing ladder said Housing Minister Mark Prisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister announced the first allocations from a £280million pot to help a further 16,500 first time buyers benefit from the FirstBuy scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk confirmed that £40million will go to 41 developers to help 2,500 first-time buyers this year - and called on them to go further, and bid for a share of £240million to help deliver thousands more new homes under the scheme next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="home-ownership-hope-for-thousands"&gt;Home ownership hope for thousands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hugely popular FirstBuy scheme reduces the amount of deposit first-time buyers have to find by offering an equity loan of up to 20 per cent provided by the Government and developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister said that the extension of FirstBuy would provide help to thousands more first time buyers across the country, offering an alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme has already helped thousands of buyers across the country, with 3,000 sales made by March this year and developers reporting more than 8,000 FirstBuy reservations by the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £280million boost to FirstBuy forms part of the Housing and Growth Package announced by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in September, one of a range of measures designed to get Britain building and kickstart the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This package builds on the suite of options available for aspiring homeowners who want to get onto and up the housing ladder. This includes the NewBuy Guarantee and the reinvigorated Right to Buy, which will give thousands of council tenants the opportunity to buy their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Firstbuy has already proved hugely successful, providing a practical alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad for thousands of first-time buyers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The scheme has become a major player in helping people onto the property ladder and getting Britain building again - and I’m determined to maintain that momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That’s why today just a month after the Prime Minister confirmed this funding boost, I’m asking developers to start putting this money to good use - and giving them the chance to start planning for how they can help first-time buyers in the coming year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homes and Communities Agency chief executive Pat Ritchie said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We welcome the additional £280million of FirstBuy funding, which will make a major difference to the lives of prospective homebuyers and keep momentum for affordable home ownership going, not only for this financial year but for the year after.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“We are pleased to be able to allocate some of the funding for this financial year, and anticipate a strong bid response to the remaining £240million, and we look forward to working with our developer partners to bring these homes forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FirstBuy provides first time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20 per cent of a new build property from a participating developer. The loan, which is jointly funded by Government and housebuilder, can reduce the deposit requirement to just 5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Budget 2011 the Chancellor announced the FirstBuy scheme which will see Government and housebuilders providing £400million to help around 10,500 first time buyers purchase a home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Homes and Communities Agency published official statistics on 12 June that showed there had been 2,994 sales by the end of March 2012 (sales starting in September 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 6 September the Prime Minister announced a further £280million for the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Homes and Communities Agency has today announced initial allocations of £40million and published a prospectus inviting housebuilders to submit proposals for the remaining £240million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Housing and growth</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coalition government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation -  after 6 years of preparation, by the general election, less than 60 councils had completed local plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was no development. No regeneration. No community benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government wants to get the economy growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove unnecessary red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support locally led sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, the government published a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/laying-the-foundations-a-housing-strategy-for-england--2" title="Laying the foundations: a housing strategy for England"&gt;housing strategy&lt;/a&gt; to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, we published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; to condense 1,000 pages of central planning guidance to just 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housebuilding is up: 29% higher in 2011 than in 2009. But there is more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, my department is announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical details are laid out in a written statement which has been laid before the House. I will summarise the key points for Hon Members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following on from &lt;a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11300/2204242.pdf" title="Review of the barriers to institutional investment in private rented homes"&gt;Sir Adrian Montague’s independent report (PDF 272 KB)&lt;/a&gt; on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing £200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the last government’s deficit, we are passing on the lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The last government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces with John Prescott’s Pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in total we will invest another £300 million in these measures to support new affordable homes and bring empty homes into use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament despite a Labour pledge to increase it by a million&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first time buyers, with an additional £280 million of funding, helping up to 16,500 additional first-time buyers to purchase a home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other government bodies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally supported large sites. Just last week, we were back to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley - a major ex-industrial site that had stalled for a decade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working with local communities and councils. But some councils need to raise their game, by failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty both for local residents and local firms. So we will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some complex developments take time to assemble. So we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are making it easier for developers to change unrealistic Section 106 agreements. A development which isn’t built means no Section 106 payments. Common sense reforms will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm that we have protected the Green Belt, in line with our commitment in the coalition agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always the case that councils can amend local Green Belt boundaries should they wish - and we will support councils which choose to. This can include introducing new Green Belt protection around new large developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements - such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for householders. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way could provide a particular boost for small traders and small builders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, these practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving more power to individuals, to communities, to councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend this statement to the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Dealing with squatters in your home</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1 September 2012, a person squatting in a residential building is committing a crime. The offence covers squatting in all residential buildings. It protects homeowners and lawful occupiers who discover squatters have occupied their homes. This is jointly produced with the Ministry of Justice and is aimed at informing property owners about the new offence and the procedures for regaining possession of their properties from squatters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mortgage arrears and possessions: forecasts</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2012 DCLG commissioned Professor Muellbauer, of Oxford University, to update his model which forecasts repossessions and loans in arrears in the UK and to produce updated forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research report sets out the changes to the model since the last report and the revised forecasts. This update led to the inclusion of an extra eight observations, together with a number of data revisions. The update also means that the forecast of loans in arrears and repossession now draws upon a range of economic forecast scenarios based mainly on underlying forecast data from the Office for Budget Responsibility but also from Oxford Economics for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new forecasts represent an improved outlook for both repossessions and arrears compared to the previous forecast. The main reason being the change in interest rate expectations; interest rates are now expected to rise much later; in mid 2013, instead of early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Tackling record deficit is helping to head off risk of repossession</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government action to tackle the nation’s record deficit is giving hard working homeowners vital breathing space to get on top of bills and head off the threat of repossession, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said that the Government’s work to reduce the deficit and help keep interest rates at a record low and mortgages affordable, combined with a raft of support to help struggling homeowners, is helping to ensure that repossession remains the last resort for millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show the number of homes taken into possession to have gone down by 11 per cent on the previous quarter to 8,500, 9 per cent less than in the same period in 2011. This is the lowest figure since the final quarter of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures come as the latest forecast from leading academic Professor John Muellbauer predict a brighter picture for both repossessions and arrears compared to his 2010 forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Repossession is a frightening prospect for any homeowner, and this Government has worked hard to help keep the pressure off by tackling the deficit and keeping interest rates at a record low.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“In these tough economic times, it’s good to know that the protections in place are preventing the worst for many families. But while repossessions remain lower than anticipated, there’s no room to be complacent.
“The advice and financial support is in place to prevent anyone from reaching that last resort measure of repossession. I would urge anyone feeling the pinch to take advantage, and seek help as soon as possible.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="help-for-homeowners"&gt;Help for Homeowners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the Government is providing help for people wanting to get on the property ladder, a range of support is also available to keep them in their homes. This help includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A £20 million Preventing Repossession fund giving every council the opportunity to offer small interest-free loans to struggling homeowners and ensure that court desks can offer on-the-day advice for those facing the prospect of repossession.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Mortgage Rescue Scheme, which has been refocused to deliver better value for money, with a reduction in the grant rate paid to housing associations and tighter caps on property prices and repair costs, to ensure as many people as possible can benefit from it. More than £200 million has been invested in the scheme and is now available through councils and housing associations to ensure help is targeted at homeowners most likely to benefit from it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Directgov website: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp"&gt;www.direct.gov.uk/mortgagehelp&lt;/a&gt; (external link) - which has lots of free advice and information. Helpful advice is also on hand from organisations including Citizens Advice and the National Debtline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Tenants equipped with the facts on Right to Buy</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh drive to help a new generation of social tenants understand how they could buy their home with dramatically increased discounts was today launched by Housing Minister Grant Shapps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new dedicated call centre and user-friendly website have now gone live to ensure aspiring home-owners among England’s 2.5 million social tenants can get advice and information about changes to the Right to Buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in April, the reinvigorated scheme offers eligible tenants discounts of up to £75,000 off the value of their home, with a national pledge that every additional property sold will be replaced with a new affordable home to rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While figures provided by a number of councils across England point to a surge in interest and Right to Buy applications since the new discounts came into force, research commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government suggests that many council and housing association tenants are unaware of the changes - or unsure whether they are eligible to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new call centre and website are part of a wider campaign to make sure tenants have all the information they need to decide whether Right to Buy is the right option for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="right-to-buy-for-25million-tenants"&gt;Right to Buy for 2.5million tenants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From today, those looking to buy their council home will be able to ring a dedicated call centre on 0300 123 0913 - or visit a new website at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://righttobuy.communities.gov.uk/"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/righttobuy&lt;/a&gt; for help and advice on the discount they could be eligible for, and the next steps they need to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils across the country have reported a surge in interest from tenants since the discounts available under the Right to Buy scheme have been increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wandsworth Council in South London, who between April and June this year received 141 applications, compared to just 13 during the same period in 2011; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Birmingham City Council, who received 463 applications in the three months to June 2012, compared to 219 during the same period in 2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For years, the Right to Buy for council tenants was undermined by punitive cuts to the discounts available, locking the door to home ownership for millions of hard-working people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Now, our revitalised Right to Buy scheme has trebled the discount in many areas, and has led to a surge in interest from aspiring homeowners across the country. But our research clearly shows that too many tenants are still in the dark about what this could mean for them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That’s why today I’m launching a dedicated call centre and website for anyone wanting to use their Right to Buy so that those wanting to buy their council home are equipped with all the facts, make an informed decision and take full advantage of the revitalised scheme to feel the pride of home ownership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Right to Buy gives something back to families who have worked hard and paid their rent, giving them more freedom to change their home to suit them and a sense of pride and ownership - not just in their home, but in their street and wider neighbourhood. Since its launch in 1980, nearly two million social homes have been bought under Right to Buy, building mixed communities and improving social mobility for families across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government suggests that many tenants are still not fully aware of the opportunity that Right to Buy offers them to get onto the housing ladder. In a survey of 824 social housing tenants in May 2012 conducted by Ipsos MORI, 83 per cent of respondents were either not aware of the Right to Buy, or were not aware of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>English housing survey household report: 2010 to 2011</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government published the English Housing Survey (EHS) Household Report 2010-11 on Thursday 5 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the detailed report of findings from the survey relating to households, and builds on results reported in the English Housing Survey Headline Report published in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English Housing Survey Homes Report 2010, formally known as the Housing Stock Report, was also published on 5 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English Housing Survey began in April 2008 bringing together two former DCLG housing surveys - the English House Condition Survey and the Survey of English Housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report includes the following findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest tenure type in 2010-11 was owner occupation, with 14.45 million households (66 per cent). This continued a slight downward trend from a peak of 14.79 million households in owner occupation (71 per cent) in 2005. The private rented sector continued to increase in size, to 3.62 million households (17 per cent).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Owner occupiers buying with a mortgage made average weekly mortgage payments of £143. This compared to average weekly rent payments of £160 made by privately renting households, and £79 by social renters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;59 per cent of private renters and 23 per cent of social renters said they expected to buy a home in the UK, at some point. Of these, 16 per cent had considered applying for a mortgage in the last 12 months. Recent first time buyers were 6 per cent of owner occupiers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were two million recently moving households in 2010-11, compared to 1.8 million in 2009-10. Of these, 62 per cent were private renters, 22 per cent were owner occupiers and 16 per cent were social renters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Households living in poverty were more likely to live in homes that had significant outstanding repairs and damp problems than households who were not living in poverty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The majority of households were satisfied with their local areas and their accommodation. However, although the majority of people felt their areas had not changed much over the previous two years, across all tenures, they were more likely to say their local area had got worse than better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Excel files below include the annex tables, and the tables and figures for each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
