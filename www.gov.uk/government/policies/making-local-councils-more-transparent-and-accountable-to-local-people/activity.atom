    <title>Improving local government transparency</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of the ‘Code of recommended practice for local authorities on Data Transparency’ in September 2011, ministers would now like to make the code a legal requirement via regulations, subject to consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to enforce the code through regulations via the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/65/contents" title="Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980"&gt;Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980&lt;/a&gt;, Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers wish to hear from all those local authorities listed in paragraph 4 of the code. They would also like to hear from relevant bodies, open data experts, developers, citizen activists and other interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is consulting on a new &lt;em&gt;Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity&lt;/em&gt; (‘the Publicity Code’) that authorities have to have regard to. The proposed new code will be underpinned by 7 guiding principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give effect to the government’s commitment to stop unfair competition by local authority newspapers, the proposed new Code now contains specific guidance on the frequency, content and appearance of local authority newspapers or magazines. It also proposes to prohibit the use of lobbyists where the expenditure is intended to influence local people on political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation invites views on the draft consolidation of the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003 and 4 amending instruments, and incorporation of a series of technical amendments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an increase in the threshold below which a body is classed as a smaller body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a revised procedure for the approval and publication of statements of accounts and other accounting statements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;new provision for the accounts of Passenger Transport Executives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the removal of criminal penalties for non-compliance with the regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft also restructures the regulations with the aim of making them easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is part of a regular series of updates to the Accounts and Audit Regulations designed to keep them in line with developments in financial governance, accounting and audit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous updates were made most recently in 2003, 2006, and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Future of local public audit</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 13 August 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced plans to disband the Audit Commission, and refocus audit of local public bodies on helping local people hold those bodies to account for local spending decisions, the very essence of localism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to replace the current, centralised audit systems managed by the Audit Commission, with a new decentralised regime, which will support local democratic accountability, and one that will also cut bureaucracy and costs, while ensuring that there continues to be robust local public audit. This consultation sets out proposals on the new audit framework where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audit quality is regulated within a statutory framework, overseen by the National Audit Office and the accountancy profession&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;local public bodies will be free to appoint their own external auditors with stringent safeguards for independence&lt;/li&gt;

    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft statistics plan describes the Department for Communities and Local Government’s proposals for collecting and publishing official statistics over the period April 2011 to March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are seeking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;users’ reactions to our proposals and their views on whether our planned deployment of resources will meet their needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;suggestions for the development of any new statistics, products or services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;suggestions for any further reductions in the amount of data we collect and publish (beyond those already submitted in the context of the ‘Single Data List’)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;information from users about the particular uses to which they put our statistics&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Rationalising statistics: land use change and housing and regional data</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is committed to rationalise data collections to minimise burden on data providers whilst ensuring that the Department’s statistics are aligned with policy priorities and meet user needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the consultation is on land use change statistics and seeks views on data collection options to ensure that these statistics continue to meet users’ priority needs whilst maximising value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part proposes a rationalised collection of housing data to reduce the burden on local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third part consults on stopping publication of regional data in light of the closure of the Government Office Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Proposed policy statement for part 2 of the Localism Act 2011</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation is on a proposed policy statement for Part 2 of the Localism Act 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act provides a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central government and towards local people. The government has given public authorities more powers and freedoms to conduct their business and deliver services to the public. This includes a major reduction in the ‘oversight’ role of central government. Public authorities must, therefore, accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions or omissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of the Localism Act is about incentivising public authorities to comply with European law, in order to avoid any financial sanctions in the first place. The proposed policy statement sets out a fair, proportionate and reasonable approach for the use of Part 2. The statement has been developed with the Local Government Association and the Greater London Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Statutory consultee performance and award of costs</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes to amend guidance in &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/circularcostsawards"&gt;Circular 03/09: Costs Awards in Appeals and Other Planning Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; in relation to statutory consultees and their advice at appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is also announcing clarifications to the guidance in relation to local councils and their development plan, and in relation to ensuring evidence submitted at appeal is manifestly accurate and truthful. The government is also requiring the five main statutory bodies to report on, and be accountable for their performance on dealing with planning applications as part of their individual Improvement Plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
