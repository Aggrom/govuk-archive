    <title>Revisions to the levels of funding required by goods and public service vehicle licence holders</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport has given notice of revisions to the levels of funding required by holders of goods and public service vehicle operators’ licences operating for hire or reward. This is a requirement of EU Regulation 1071/2009 which affects holders of standard national and standard international licences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Traffic Commissioners retain their discretion to set the financial standing levels for restricted licence holders (not covered by the regulation) and they propose to maintain the current rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised figures are set out below and are based on the euro exchange rate on the first working day in October 2012 – as prescribed by EU Regulation 1071/2009. The new rates will come into force on 1 January 2013 and will remain in place until the 31 December 2013 (previous rates are in brackets). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Minimum financial level requirement&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standard national and standard international licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£7,200 (£7,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£4,000, ( £4,200)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Restricted licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£3,100 ( £3,100)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£1,700 ( £1,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits set by EU Regulation 1071/2009 are 9000 euros for the first vehicle and 5000 euros for each subsequent vehicle. For member states not participating in monetary union, the regulation requires the equivalent in their currencies to be revised every year, using the euro exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the first working day of October in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="latest-data"&gt;Latest data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisional data show that 82.3% of journeys made on Highways Agency managed roads between November 2011 and October 2012 were ‘on time’. This is 0.3 percentage points lower than the previous rolling year, ending in September 2012..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During October 2012, provisional data show that 79.6% of journeys on Highways Agency’s motorway and ‘A’ road network were ‘on time’. This is 3.4 percentage points lower than the equivalent figure for October 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The annual reliability measure consistently increased up to March 2012, but has fallen in the last seven months, and has now dropped below the level observed at the end of 2011. The recent downward trend in reliability reflects the substantial amount of rainfall experienced since spring compared with the same period in 2011. In fact, rainfall in each of the last seven months has been higher in 2012 compared to the same month in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background-information"&gt;Background information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicator monitors the reliability of journeys made on Highways Agency’s motorway and A road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indicator is measured by the percentage of ‘journeys’ on these roads that are ‘on time’. For this measure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a ‘journey’ represents travel between adjacent junctions on the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an ‘on time journey’ is defined as one which is completed within a set reference time, drawn from historic data on that particular section of road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reference journey times are updated for the April data each year - further information on the impact of updating reference times can be found in section 3 of the latest &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/road-congestion-and-reliability-statistics"&gt;statistical release&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, information about the reliability of journeys on individual routes, or between particular junctions on the network, are not sufficiently robust to be presented as official statistics. This is due to the range of different sources used to calculate journey times across the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is working with the Highways Agency to address these issues of comparability. It is likely that any actions to address these issues will also require some historic adjustment to the national series although the trends reported in national reliability to date are unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this programme is complete, the Highways Agency will publish information about journey time reliability at a sub-national level through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk"&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>£19.5 million to kick start regeneration in Portsmouth</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work to kick-start the regeneration of the 22 hectare Tipner site in Portsmouth can now start after receiving final approval from Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will see Portsmouth City Council deliver extensive improvements including a new access road to the site from the M275 and a new Park &amp;amp; Ride scheme. As well as improving access to the regeneration site at Tipner, the scheme will relieve traffic and congestion on local residential roads around the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This important scheme will encourage regeneration of the Tipner site by opening up access to the area for businesses and visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new junction on the M275 and the new park and ride scheme will be a huge boost for the area - helping to deliver new homes and new jobs as well as reducing congestion and encouraging visitors to the city. Having visited Portsmouth to see for myself, I am in no doubt that this is a good scheme and a sensible use of taxpayers money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The £19.5 million we are putting into this scheme shows that the coalition government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country needs to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will deliver:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new motorway junction on the M275 at Tipner providing access to the development site and greatly reduce the impact of construction traffic on local roads - at present the only access to the site is via existing narrow Victorian streets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new additional bus priority lane on the M275 heading south from the new interchange - this is intended to improve public transport between Tipner and central Portsmouth and improve bus reliability, this will be an additional lane and would not remove any capacity for general traffic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a park and ride site accessed via the new motorway junction, with bus every 10 minutes to the city centre/Gunwharf Quays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tipner scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the spending review process. Work can now start on the construction with the project scheduled to complete in April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement grants full (final) approval to the Tipner scheme enabling work to begin.The department will provide a maximum of £19.5 million towards the full scheme cost of £28.19 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Autumn statement: huge boost for transport</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor announced funding for the following transport projects as part of the Autumn statement 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="scheme-a1-leeming-to-barton-improvements"&gt;Scheme: A1 Leeming to Barton improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £314 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upgrading the A1 between Leeming to Barton to motorway standard by upgrading a dual carriageway to a three lane road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will create a continuous motorway standard route from Leeds to Newcastle and London to Newcastle (via M1/A1M)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will also improve journey times between Leeming and Barton and over 60 years is predicted to save around 100 lives and prevent around 650 serious casualties as well as helping speed up the time it takes to clear up traffic incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;during construction it is estimated that at its peak up to 750 new jobs will be created in the construction industry over the three year construction period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;completion of the scheme will support the economic competitiveness of the north-east and improve access to regional employment areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the reduction in journey times of some 20% will directly benefit business users, improving the attractiveness of these areas for future development and growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;works are planned to start in 2013/14 with the scheme open for traffic by 2016/17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a5-m1-link-dunstable-northern-bypass"&gt;Scheme: A5-M1 link (Dunstable northern bypass)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £126.6 million (Department for Transport (DfT) contribution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new dual two-lane road between the A5 (western end) and the M1 (eastern end) north of Dunstable and Houghton Regis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will remove through traffic between Dunstable and the M1 speeding up longer distance north south trips&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will also unlock the development of 7,000 houses and 40 hectares of employment land – potentially providing 4,000 jobs – at Houghton Regis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work will start in 2014/15 with the scheme open for traffic in 2015/16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a1-lobley-hill-improvement"&gt;Scheme: A1 Lobley Hill improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £64 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new roads in both directions parallel to the existing A1 between Lobley Hill and A184 in Gateshead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will provide an alternative route for local traffic improving congestion and accident rates on one of the most congested sections of the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the government made a commitment through the Newcastle ‘City Deal’ process to work with local partners on considering proposals to address congestion on the A1 Newcastle/Gateshead western bypass – including proposals to deliver the Lobley Hill improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it also helps support local regeneration and development, including the creation of up to 22,000 new jobs, as the congestion is considered as a major constraint to expansion of regional employment and housing &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work is planned to start in 2014/15 with the scheme open for traffic by 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-highways-maintenance"&gt;Scheme: Highways maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £333 million &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dedicated fund for essential maintenance to renew, repair and extend life of road network in England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will be used for improvements such as road resurfacing, maintenance to bridges, or repair damage caused by weather events, like recent floods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the money will be split between Highways Agency and local authorities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;details of how each area will benefit from this additional investment will be announced shortly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-strategic-road-pinch-point-fund"&gt;Scheme: Strategic road pinch point fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £100 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional funding for the Highways Agency’s pinch point fund to improve congestion and safety at bottlenecks on the strategic road network and facilitate local economic growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will be used for improvements such as road widening and junction improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes delivered as part of this programme will facilitate the creation of jobs and housing, improve access to enterprise zones and transport gateways that are within the vicinity of the scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Highways Agency will now work on identifying the specific projects that will benefit and make an announcement shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-local-pinch-point-fund"&gt;Scheme: Local pinch point fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £170 million &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fund to remove bottlenecks and support development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes delivered as part of this programme will facilitate the creation of jobs and housing development, improve access to enterprise zones and transport gateways - this could include new access roads, junction improvements or bridge strengthening&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the fund is open to local transport authorities in England - guidance on how to apply for funding and timescales will be published shortly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schemes considered will be ones that can be delivered quickly delivering an immediate impact on growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-a30-temple-to-carblake"&gt;Scheme: A30 Temple to Carblake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £60 million (£30 million DfT contribution and £30 million Cornwall Council contribution)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 2.6 mile dualling of the existing single carriageway section of the A30 between Temple and Higher Carblake including changes to existing junctions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme will relieve congestion and improve journey times - it will also attract business growth and inward investment to Cornwall by improving links the rest of England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cornwall Council is proposing to deliver and part-fund the scheme on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work will start in 2014/2015 (subject to the completion of planning processes and funding agreements between Cornwall Council) with the scheme open for traffic in 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-accelerated-national-road-projects"&gt;Scheme: Accelerated national road projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £95 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the acceleration of three major motorway upgrades for M3 J2 to 4a, Surrey, M6 J10a to 13, West Midlands and M1 J28 to 31, Derbyshire to deliver the improvement schemes by spring 2015&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will result in increased capacity of 73 miles and reduced congestion through use of the hard shoulder as an extra lane&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vital improvements to the A160/A180 route to the port of Immingham will also be brought forward to start construction in the summer of 2015 (subject to the completion of statutory processes), with completion in autumn 2016 - cutting 18 months off the original construction timetable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-development-of-future-national-road-projects"&gt;Scheme: Development of future national road projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £42 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuing the development (detailed design, modelling and preparatory work) of future major road projects to maintain a pipeline of major road infrastructure proposals for delivery in the next spending review&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development work will put in place the necessary preparatory work and analysis to ensure the Department for Transport can plan its future investments and ensure it is in a position to deliver vital future infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the development funding provides a contribution to UK job creation as it will be delivered in part through the transport supply chain &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the department has previously identified a number of future national road proposals and will announce in due course which schemes will have their development work funded, following a process of prioritisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-cycling-infrastructure-improvements"&gt;Scheme: Cycling infrastructure improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £42 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this funding will support infrastructure improvements that make it easier and safer for people get around their local areas by bicycle  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this could include more cycle lanes or tracks, improvements to junctions and signals, and cycle parking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;local authorities will design solutions best for their areas while keeping a strong focus on economic growth and carbon reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="scheme-m25-junction-30-improvements"&gt;Scheme: M25 junction 30 improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £150 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved interface between M25 junction 30 and the A13 making the Thames Gateway more attractive to prospective developers, and improving access to the Lakeside shopping centre and the Port of Tilbury &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Highways Agency will now work up detailed plans for the scheme but options being considered are widening of the A13 and increased capacity at the junction roundabout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this will need to take account of the location of an additional crossing over the Lower Thames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following scheme was also announced but will be funded from existing Highways Agency budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="scheme-m40-j12-improvement"&gt;Scheme: M40 J12 improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost: £10 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;improving the layout at J12 of the M40 near Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) facility which includes their Research and Development Centre and the Aston Martin Lagonda site &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme includes realignment of the slip roads and a local side road and the installation of traffic signals at the top of the slip roads -it will assist traffic using the M40 which includes over 6,000 vehicles travelling to and from the JLR site and improve safety at the junction by alleviating traffic queuing back onto the M40 at peak times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme supports local economic growth and will benefit the national economy by reducing localised congestion on this strategic route between the Midlands and the south-east - it will also improve safety &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scheme is being funded from existing Highways Agency budgets &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
