    <title>New study offers bus pass holders a third off train travel</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older and disabled people with bus passes will be able to get a third off train travel as part of a twelve-month experiment announced by Rail Minister Norman Baker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial is being launched on Sunday to encourage more older and disabled people to use trains, and means concessionary bus pass holders will be able to claim discounted fares on two test routes without purchasing an annual Senior Railcard, which costs £28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is being rolled out by First Great Western and will apply to standard off-peak fares between Worcester and Swindon via Stroud, and between Westbury and Weymouth. The department will be assessing the trial keenly to see if a wider and more permanent application might be merited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail Minister Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is great news for bus pass holders and hopefully they will take full advantage of the discounts on offer through this innovative scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everybody is feeling the squeeze at the moment and this trial will help older and disabled people save money while travelling on these two important railway lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The railways are not only a crucial part of our country’s economic growth but they also provide a valuable link for families and friends. I am confident this scheme will help bolster those links and provide real benefits to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campaigning groups including the National Pensioner’s Convention and the National Federation of Occupational Pensioners have previously lobbied for concessionary bus passes to be used as a senior railcard, and believe it will lead to higher numbers of older and disabled people purchasing rail tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department will work with First Great Western to examine the commercial viability of the scheme with a final report due in November next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Hopwood, First Great Western Managing Director, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First Great Western is privileged to provide services to some of the country’s leading destinations and our branch lines to Worcester and Weymouth are symbolic of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted to be able to take part in this trial, which should help improve access for senior citizens and people with disabilities to the services that we offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aim of the study is to provide the DfT with robust information to inform Train Operating Companies (TOCs) and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) on the commercial viability of extending some of the privileges associated with the Senior and Disabled Railcard to all holders of English National Concessionary travel passes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FGW will carry out a discount scheme over the course of one year offering holders of concessionary travel passes a 34% discount on standard class tickets at off-peak times (after 9.30am and before 11pm on weekday, all day on weekends and bank holidays) on the test areas of the rail network.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The study will report quarterly on a quantitative assessment of the changes in peak and off-peak patronage amongst older and disabled customers that result from the discount scheme being available. Comparisons, where appropriate will be made to First Great Western’s continual customer research study; Customer Satisfaction Monitor (CSM).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DfT is due a final research report from FGW in November 2013.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Accessibility statistics: 2011</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents information on accessibility statistics for England for 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility statistics provide a local-level measure of the availability of transport to key services (covering food stores, education, health care, town centres and employment centres) for the populations who use them. They are widely used in accessibility planning by local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in travel times and accessibility can be caused by three factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number and location of service destinations;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the quality of the service destinations datasets;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and road / travel factors (such as public transport timetables, road layout and congestion).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most the cases changes in the first two factors (i.e. relating to the number and location of destinations and data quality) will have a greater affect on average travel times than changes in timetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release provides a summary of the statistics at national and regional level. The full set of results, including figures at Local Authority and Lower Super Output Area level, are available in separate files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average minimum travel time to the seven key services (excluding town centres) was 14 minutes by public transport/walking, 9 minutes by cycling and 6 minutes by car. These times were 0.55 minutes longer than in 2010 for public transport/walking and around 0.2 minutes longer than in 2010 for both cycling and by car.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average of key services excluding town centres&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As in previous years, hospitals had the longest average minimum travel times of the seven key services in 2011 with average minimum travel times of 30 minutes by public transport/walking, 21 minutes by cycling and 9 minutes by driving. Primary schools and foods stores were the most accessible services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users in urban areas could access key services by public transport/walking, on average, in 12 minutes compared with 22 minutes in rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proportion of users able to access key services by public transport/walking in a ‘reasonable’ time was highest for employment centres (81%). The lowest was for hospitals (29%).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overall access to key services by public transport/walking within a ‘reasonable’ time was greatest in London and lowest in the East of England.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Personal Independence Payment and eligibility for a Blue Badge </title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-30/"&gt;consultation document on Personal Independence Payment and eligibility for a Blue Badge&lt;/a&gt;. The consultation period closes on Tuesday 2 October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition government is taking forward important reforms to the welfare system. One of these reforms will involve changes to Disability Living Allowance and will affect eligibility for a disabled person’s parking permit or Blue Badge. About a third of all badges are currently issued to people who receive the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance. My department is therefore consulting on the options we have for dealing with the impact of the changes. The consultation covers arrangements for England only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am committed to ensuring that the Blue Badge scheme continues to be focused on those people who will benefit most from the parking concessions that it offers, and that it is sustainable in the future. The government has identified three main options for responding to the implementation of Personal Independence Payments. The three main options are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 1 - no legislative link between eligibility for a Blue Badge and eligibility to Personal Independence Payment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Option 2 - establishing a legislative link between Blue Badge eligibility and the enhanced mobility component of Personal Independence Payment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Option 3 - establishing a legislative link between Blue Badge eligibility and those who score 8 points or more within the ‘Moving Around’ activity within Personal Independence Payment - this assesses a person’s physical ability to get around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s preferred option is Option 3 as it would mean that eligibility for a Blue Badge would be most similar to the current scheme and the potential impacts of this option are minimal. We will, however, consider this in light of views and comments sent in as part of the consultation. The government is also asking for other suggestions for other practical and sustainable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation concludes on 2 October 2012. Personal Independence Payments will be introduced for new claimants aged between 16 and 64 from April 2013 onwards. It will begin to replace Disability Living Allowance for existing recipients aged between 16 and 64 from October 2013 onwards. Any consequential changes to the Blue Badge scheme will also be phased in and will affect existing badge holders when an existing badge expires and they need to apply for a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of the consultation document has been placed in the library of the House.&lt;/p&gt;
