    <title>Department for Transport's boost to train builders</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New train carriages procured by Southern Railway. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train builders have received a year-end boost as the government announces its backing for two new train orders, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of government support, Southern Railway has now procured 40 new carriages from Bombardier based in Derby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 40 carriages, the government is also supporting Southern’s tendering process for 116 new electric carriages with the option for a further 140.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our support for Southern will not only boost capacity but help secure British jobs. The deal for the 40 new carriages, helped along by my department, demonstrates the government’s ongoing commitment to invest in Britain’s railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My officials are working with Southern to accelerate their procurement process for up to 256 carriages because our ambitious electrification plans requires additional rolling stock on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2011 Southern Railway, with government support, announced its plans to buy 130 carriages from Bombardier to run on services in south London, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. Southern expects these will be in service by December 2013. As part of this deal Southern had the option to buy the additional 40 carriages at a later stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July the government announced the biggest programme of rail modernisation since the Victorian era. At the heart of the scheme was the electrification of the Midland Main Line, from London to Sheffield, with additional spurs linking it to the Great Western Main Line and the Port of Southampton.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Southern progresses with the procurement, these 116 new vehicles, and potentially 140 more, could initially be used on the Thameslink routes. Once the expected new Thameslink trains are operational these carriages will be moved to the newly electrified routes, which could include the Midland Main Line to Corby and North Transpennine Routes.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Latest quarterly data on rail passenger miles.</summary>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passengers travelled 9.2 billion miles by rail in the second quarter of 2012-13 (July to September 2012), an increase of 4 per cent when compared to the same quarter in 2011-12.  The second quarter of 2012-13 included the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which will have contributed to this increase in rail travel.  These figures are for franchised operators only, so exclude travel with non-franchised operators, such as Grand Central, Heathrow Express and Hull Trains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years, other than a slight dip in 2009 during the recession, passenger rail usage has increased significantly, continuing the upward trend that has been seen since the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passenger miles travelled with franchised rail operators&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background-information"&gt;Background information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail passenger kilometres totals are published quarterly by the Office of Rail Regulation (&lt;abbr title="Office of Rail Regulation"&gt;ORR&lt;/abbr&gt;). The rail industry’s central ticketing system, LENNON, is the basis for passenger kilometres data. LENNON holds information on the vast majority of national rail tickets purchased in Great Britain and is used to allocate the revenue from ticket sales between train operating companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Office of Rail Regulation"&gt;ORR&lt;/abbr&gt; also receives quarterly non-LENNON kilometres data from train operators. Non-LENNON data are information not recorded within the LENNON system such as operator specific tickets and Passenger Transport Executive (&lt;abbr title="Passenger Transport Executive"&gt;PTE&lt;/abbr&gt;) multi-modal tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics are converted from kilometres to miles by DfT for the purposes of this publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data supplied in the table and the charts refer to financial rather than calendar years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="change-in-methodology-in-sourcing-cost-of-running-the-rail-network-figures"&gt;Change in Methodology in sourcing Cost of Running the Rail Network figures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication last year used data from operators’ statutory accounts.  This year the data are based on management accounts; this ensures that the time period to which the data applies is consistent across operators, and allows comparisons to be made over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="operating-costs"&gt;Operating costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) These data are based on the ORR study “Costs and Revenues of Franchised Passenger Train Operators in the UK”, which in turn sourced data from the operators’ management accounts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any figures relating to premia or associated payments to the Department for Transport or Passenger Transport Executives are excluded. Within this total are payments made by operators to Network Rail for access to the rail network which contribute towards infrastructure costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) Operators may not treat all aspects of operating costs in the same way in their accounts, and so care should be taken when using these figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="network-grant"&gt;Network Grant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(c) This is calculated by taking the total Network Grant paid to Network Rail by DfT in 2010-11, and allocating it to each franchise based on their share of Fixed Track Access Charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Allocated Network Grant’ column, allocates, to each operator, the grant paid by the Department for Transport to Network Rail in 2010-11. The grant effectively pays the infrastructure costs incurred by Network Rail that are not covered by operators. In the table above, each operator is allocated a share of the grant in proportion to their Fixed Track Access Charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train operating companies’ costs are taken from ORR publication &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/toc-benchmarking-report-2012.pdf"&gt;Costs and Revenues of Franchised Passenger Train Operators in the UK&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Government secures free travel for London Midland passengers</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A £7 million package of benefits for rail passengers who suffered cancelled services and delays.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail passengers who suffered cancelled services and delays last year will receive free travel passes and cheap tickets thanks to tough action taken by the government, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Midland season ticket holders will be given 5 days worth of free travel passes under a £7 million package of benefits. The government has also secured 500,000 additional cheap advance tickets for passengers on key network routes serving London, Birmingham, Northampton, Crewe and Liverpool and a commitment to invest in infrastructure improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“London Midland has cancelled or delayed hundreds of services in recent months. On repeated occasions, they were not able to provide enough drivers and some services had to be cancelled, with severe delays to services, and they have fallen short both of everyone’s expectations and their franchise obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Securing these benefits for passengers represents a firm yellow-card for London Midland and some financial benefit for those who have been hardest hit by their poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am confident London Midland has now rectified their driver shortage but the company need to be clear that we will continue to monitor their performance closely and take firmer action if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free tickets will be available to all monthly and annual season ticket holders, as well as to weekly ticket holders who have been affected by disruption, while the additional Advance tickets will be available over the next two years to passengers planning to travel on key London Midland routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal that has been struck will also confirm the end date of the franchise as September 2015, ensuring that London Midland is given sufficient time to resolve these problems on a permanent basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Midland will also spend millions of pounds improving the resilience of their trains and will invest at least £2.25 million on a range of measures to benefit passengers - primarily in the West Midlands, where the worst disruption was experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-for-editors"&gt;Notes for editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government is taking this action because London Midland were responsible for the cancellation of a high number of services, particularly at weekends and during the half-term period, due to a shortage of drivers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The free 5-day passes will enable annual and monthly season ticket holders to make additional journeys outside of their regular commute, or as an extension to existing season tickets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 500,000 additional cheaper advance tickets will be issued over and above those issued in the last year and will be for travel during 2013 and 2014. The tickets will be available on key routes including London-Birmingham, London-Crewe, London-Northampton and Birmingham-Liverpool.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Rail franchising</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Compensation package for passengers agreed with London Midland.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would today like to give an update on the situation in relation to franchised train operator London Midland (&lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passengers who use &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; trains may be aware that the operator has been experiencing difficulties recently, with a number of services being cancelled due to a shortage of driving staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation has caused inconvenience and disruption, particularly to passengers in the West Midlands, many of whom have expressed their dissatisfaction to me. I very much share their disappointment that they have not had the reliable service that they rightly expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although the recent levels of performance have been extremely disappointing, I am pleased to say that the measures that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; have put in place are beginning to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; has implemented increases to driver efficiency to enable drivers to operate an increased number of routes during existing shifts, improved driver training processes, provided additional incentives for drivers to work overtime and put in place new measures that allow for drivers to cover shifts on other parts of the network where there are shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in addition to the ongoing training programme that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; is undertaking to ensure that new drivers enter productive service as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt;’s performance has been of such a level that they are now in breach of their contractual obligations. We have made London Midland aware that they must now take action to compensate passengers for the disruption caused. We have, therefore, agreed with &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; that they will provide a substantial package of passenger benefits by way of compensation for the inconvenience that has been caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; has agreed to spend an additional £4 million over the remainder of the franchise to put in place measures to ensure that these problems do not happen again. In addition, the package of passenger benefits includes the issue of 5 free rail day passes to London Midland season ticket holders, with an expected value of up to £3.5 million. We have also agreed that London Midland will invest a further £2.25 million in infrastructure improvement projects. We have required London Midland to discuss with Centro, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, how the majority of this money will be invested for the benefit of those passengers who have experienced the worst disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this consultation, &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; has agreed that most of this money should be directed towards measures such as improvements to safety and security at stations and improving the reliability and efficiency of &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have also agreed with &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; that they must make available an additional 500,000 Advance tickets on key routes on the &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; network, giving a net benefit of around £1.9 million to passengers who will be able to take advantage of these cheaper fares over the next two years of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; will be able to remain the operator of this franchise for the remainder of its contract - to September 2015. But London Midland will continue to work to challenging performance benchmarks for the remainder of the franchise, and we will take further action (including ending the franchise early and re-tendering it, if appropriate) in the event of any recurrence of performance problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the package of passenger benefits, we have agreed to revise the profile of performance benchmarks for the next year, to include additional measures that can penalise &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; financially in the event of further poor performance. We have also agreed financial measures to ensure that the reduction in revenue as a result of the free and discounted tickets is borne by &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt;, and not by the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am confident that this package, on balance, represents a good deal for passengers and taxpayers, and sends a message to the industry that this level of cancellations is unsatisfactory. I hope that &lt;abbr title="London Midland"&gt;LM&lt;/abbr&gt; can now put this period behind it, and continue to operate a good service for its passengers for the remainder of its franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Operators urged to tackle crowding on busiest services</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Train operators are urged to tackle overcrowding on their services after a list reveals the top 10 most congested trains.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker has urged train operators to continue work to tackle congestion on their services following the publication today of the top 10 most crowded trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London is served by some of the busiest trains in the country according to the list of crowded trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Climbing on a crowded train where there is little space can often be an unpleasant experience and I sympathise with passengers who have to travel on these services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operators on the list are aware of the crowding problems on these particular services. I will be monitoring these services closely, and others which have not made the top 10 list, and urging train companies to reduce crowding on the busiest services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rail has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years. That is why we are investing in more carriages, longer trains and better services and funding major projects like HS2, Crossrail and Thameslink, all of which will significantly boost capacity on our rail network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an important tool to give increased transparency to passengers and help the industry act to improve journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, compiled from data collected in Autumn 2011, shows that the following services were the busiest in England and Wales (in descending order): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:44am service from Henley on Thames to London Paddington – load factor 180%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:32am service from Woking to London Waterloo – load factor 164%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:13pm service from London Euston to Birmingham New Street – load factor 162%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4:48pm service from London Euston to Birmingham New Street – load factor 160%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:30am service from Banbury to London Paddington – load factor 158%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:55am service from Stourbridge Junction to Stratford-upon-Avon – load factor 157%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:23am service from Manchester Airport to Middlesbrough – load factor 155%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6:17pm service from London Liverpool Street to Shenfield – load factor 154%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:14am service from Alton to London Waterloo – load factor 152%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5:46pm service from London Euston to Birmingham New Street – load factor 152%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Department for Transport (DfT) collects rail passenger counts from train operating companies to monitor train crowding levels. All franchises let by DfT require the train operator to address crowding and to plan their timetables in such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, that crowding is not unduly concentrated on any particular route or individual service. The table included in this paper shows the 10 most overcrowded peak services in the autumn 2011 passenger counts data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ‘top 10’ list is determined based on ‘load factor’, which is the number of standard class passengers on a service expressed as a percentage of the standard class passenger capacity for that service. For example, a train which has the same passenger load as the passenger capacity would have a load factor of 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First Great Western has recently strengthened the 7:44am service from Henley on Thames to London Paddington by adding an additional carriage, so that the number of standard class seats has increased to 340.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From December 2012 London Midland is providing three Class 350/2 ‘high density’ units for the 6:13pm service from London to Birmingham New Street to maximise the number of seats. In the long term, London Midland has 10 new 4 car trains on order that will allow them to operate additional trains on this route from 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From September 2012, the 6:30am service from Banbury to London Paddington has started from Oxford not Banbury, leaving Oxford at 7:00am. It is now operated by a different type of rolling stock which provides a higher standard class seating capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More recent counts on the 7:55am service from Stourbridge Junction to Stratford-upon-Avon suggest much lower loadings on this service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the long term, from the May 2014 timetable period, it is planned to introduce a fifth train per hour between Manchester and Leeds which should relieve capacity on the 6:23am service from Manchester Airport to Middlesbrough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The top 10 list can be accessed on the &lt;a href="/government/publications/top-10-overcrowded-train-services-england-and-wales"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Industry launches new rail technical strategy</title>

    <summary>New techniques and technologies to improve the performance and cost-effectiveness of the railway.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail industry leaders have outlined a 30 year vision for the railway through a new edition of the ‘Rail technical strategy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Rail technical strategy’ describes how technology can help the railway increase capacity, improve reliability, cut carbon emissions and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy has been developed by the Technical Strategy Leadership Group – a cross-industry expert body with representatives from across the rail industry – and endorsed by the Rail Delivery Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.futurerailway.org"&gt;Read the Rail technical strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of State for Transport  Simon Burns MP welcomed the strategy saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the industry picking up the baton to develop this Rail technical strategy. Technology has a vital role to play in improving the railway’s performance, cutting its costs along with carbon emissions and delivering a better travelling experience for passengers. By setting in place a 30 year vision, the railway is demonstrating that it has a bright and exciting future, and the potential to support our economy and society for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great pleasure to join you today for this important conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re here to talk about ‘transparency’ – one of those modern buzzwords that we hear all the time in politics, business, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by giving you my own perspective on transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transparency-for-the-customer"&gt;Transparency for the customer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak as a rail minister…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a regular user of the rail network…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a Liberal Democrat…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have campaigned for transparency ever since I was first elected in 1997.  The first bill I presented to Parliament was on the release of public records and I was the first person to submit a &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; request of MPs’ expenses, with all the ramifications that led to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you won’t be surprised that I’m a passionate believer in transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something we need to see more of from every powerful institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of the progress we have made to open up government and the wider public sector in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will say this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about building the respect, trust and confidence of the people who use and fund the network - passengers, freight customers, and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true measure of transparency comes not from those who claim to practise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes from those on the outside who stand to benefit from it… the passengers and the public who provide the patronage and pounds sterling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be a shared agenda, while we have made big strides over the past few years, we still have some way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/government/publications/report-of-the-laidlaw-inquiry"&gt;Laidlaw report&lt;/a&gt; last week made a specific criticism of the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; when it said the department wasn’t transparent enough with bidders about the franchise process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are correcting that and we will be more transparent in future, but you have to do your bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rail-transparency"&gt;Rail transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me put rail transparency in some sort of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Open Public Services White Paper&lt;/a&gt; last year set the scene for the government’s transparency agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was followed this year by another White Paper and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.data.gov.uk/library/dft-open-data-strategy"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Open Data Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamental to these programmes are public services which are responsive to the people they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations which can be held to account by citizens and elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open data is crucial to this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rail reform programme highlighted 3 specific areas for transparency: rail finances; network performance and open access to information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so much has already been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together we are now publishing a great deal of performance data, from right time and passenger complaints to statistics on overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has set out the costs of supporting the network by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt;; subsidies per mile; and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Rail has separated accounts by route. And new information about &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; finances will be published next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And passengers have much better access to timetables and real time service information than they had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, data produced by Network Rail is allowing developers to generate phone and computer apps for passengers on how trains are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a private-sector, not-for-dividend, company limited by guarantee, Network Rail is not currently subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Nonetheless, as a regulated provider of public services, in receipt of public subsidy, the company wisely recognises the demand for more of its information and data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, it began a programme to publish more of its information and data on its website, including an on-line form allowing members of the public to make suggestions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government welcomes these steps, which will improve the organisation’s accountability to passengers and taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I welcome the excellent news from the last &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dft-transport-sector-transparency-board"&gt;Transport Transparency Board&lt;/a&gt; that the fares database will be released as open data during the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="olympics"&gt;Olympics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these transparency measures are designed for long-term dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Olympic Games earlier this year set the industry a more immediate challenge around the provision of transport data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of the programme was to provide businesses and the public with information about the transport network, and which stations were likely to be busiest at different times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, Network Rail, &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt; and train operators worked with organisers to produce ‘hotspot’ data which was published on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/"&gt;Get Ahead of the Games&lt;/a&gt; website – together with journey planners and interactive tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site had over 16 million page views and 4 million unique users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it played a key role in what was an enormously successful operation to manage transport demand during the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience was invaluable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It showed just what can be achieved by planning ahead and communicating information to users of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was also a lesson in how to deliver data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is of little use if it’s too complicated or inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to be carefully managed, targeted and presented to meet the needs and expectations of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s precisely what was achieved by the team who delivered the Olympics transport plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fares-and-ticketing"&gt;Fares and ticketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the government re-shuffle back in September, the new &lt;a href="/government/people/patrick-mcloughlin"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; asked me to lead the &lt;a href="/government/consultations/rail-fares-and-ticketing-review"&gt;fares and ticketing review&lt;/a&gt; in the department.  You will appreciate that this is a hugely labyrinthine process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I am concerned, transparency is key to the review.  I want an outcome where the passenger can easily access the right information to enable them to buy the right ticket for their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while many do, many don’t.  Indeed, there appears to be some confusion even at the highest levels, judging by &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s comments in the metro last week blaming the government for the rise in unregulated fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the issue of right-time information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="right-time"&gt;Right-time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will know, I have been pushing for the release of right-time – the number of trains arriving within 59 seconds of the advertised arrival time - for some time now, actually for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first raised this formally at the Performance Delivery Group which I chair on 20 July 2011 and I am to be honest disappointed that it has taken this long to get where we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that it is not the intention of the government to replace &lt;abbr title="Public Performance Measure"&gt;PPM&lt;/abbr&gt; with right-time for performance benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may together conclude that the correct benchmark is whether a long-distance service arrives within 9 minutes and 59 seconds, but it is close to dishonest to suggest that a train arriving 9 minutes and 59 seconds after its stated arrival time is on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public are entitled to know the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I recognise, and indeed sympathise, that there is a concern within the industry that if this information is published, you will be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I observe at this point that ScotRail recently released its right-time data and the world has not ended north of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that releasing information to the public can be uncomfortable – just look at the hundreds of &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; requests we have to deal with in the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; each month.  But actually the free availability of information is a key tool to driving up performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry will be releasing right-time data by &lt;abbr title="Terms and conditions"&gt;TOC&lt;/abbr&gt; on 20 December, even if the timing means it won’t be getting much coverage, I will be making a lot of noise about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be making comments saying what a good showing this is from the industry.  In terms of both performance and transparency we’re ahead of our European competitors so this staging post is welcome, but we need to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commuter on the 6:40 from Aylesbury, the student on the 8:32 to Brighton and the occasional traveller on the 10:15 to Nuneaton have a right to know whether their train is regularly on time or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look fwd to these passengers having the data they need when we make a further right-time release in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information is held by the ORR and, as such, it is available under the &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; laws.  It is in my view far better for the industry to be on the front-foot with this rather than have it extracted by someone hostile to the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-transport-sectors"&gt;Other transport sectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony is that the rail industry is doing pretty well in punctuality.  Both in comparisons with other countries, and in this country when compared with other modes.  Why hide your light under a bushel as if there is a guilty secret?  Those of you who have been to my office will have heard me reference the poster in my office which champions the railway against the clogged road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am determined the same level of transparency should apply to other transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highways Agency, for example, has released a wide range of statistics about roadworks and real-time traffic conditions, and over 80% local authorities have opened up their roadwork data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working with the Agency to improve reliability data for the motorway network, and hope to publish information on the wider road network next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus industry has released its national database of services across Britain, with access to real time information from all 350,000 bus stops… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple but enormously effective improvement for passengers, particularly during these winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the aviation industry is also embracing transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is already publishing monthly punctuality data by route and airline for 10 UK airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our Civil Aviation Bill will enshrine further powers to collect and publish data to help the consumer. Specifically, it will require the industry to provide information that the CAA considers appropriate to help passengers understand and compare different services and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Bill has completed its passage through Parliament and now awaits Royal Assent.  We anticipate that this will be before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s more the aviation industry could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we would like the airlines to provide clearer information about the ticket price their customers should expect to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in reality, you have a good story to tell.  Some of you, however, are mindlessly trying to cover it up.  This is 1950s thinking and frankly, it won’t wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me conclude by first of all recognising and congratulating the industry for the strides it has made towards greater transparency in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an industry that received £3 billion of public subsidy in 2010/11, the public has a right to clearer and more open information on costs, performance and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is what you are delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also urge you – wherever possible – to press ahead with further transparency in the future so it becomes embedded in the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I believe that whatever helps the passenger will ultimately help the railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
