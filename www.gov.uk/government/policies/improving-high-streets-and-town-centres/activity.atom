    <title>Eric Pickles opens pop-up shop to showcase high street entrepreneurs</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the government’s efforts to regenerate high streets and encourage entrepreneurs, the shop is being opened in time for final Christmas present buying this week by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Local Growth Minister Mark Prisk, with the support of national enterprise campaign StartUp Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To directly support enterprise and showcase Britain’s best new retailers, ministers have set up the pop-up store inside their Victoria-based office building to act as a blueprint for high streets across the country to emulate through schemes such as Portas Pilots and Town Teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cutting the ribbon on the pop-up shop" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5697/ribbon-cutting.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Eric Pickles cutting the ribbon with Mark Prisk and Emma Jones, co-founder of StartUp Britain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles unveiled the first ever Whitehall pop-up shop with ‘Apprentice’ winning entrepreneur Tim Campbell. Every fortnight six new British start-up businesses will move into the shop, sharing costs and trialling their exciting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shop will be open to the public for at least a year and will offer affordable retail space to over 150 small start-up businesses. The department is not seeking any financial return from the shop, which is being supported by sponsors Intuit, John Lewis, SNR Denton and StartUp Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inside the pop-up shop" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5698/shop-floor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first 6 pop-up tenants are NANUKK, Milla &amp;amp; Arti, Arthur &amp;amp; Henry, London Mummy, Morrow’s Outfitters and The English Tee Shop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers believe pop-ups are a great way to get empty spaces used and could be easily replicated in other town centres across the country. Mr Prisk has written to the British Property Federation to urge landlords to get on board. He said that, starting in January, all 27 Portas Pilots and 330 Town Team partners will receive support to facilitate new pop-ups in their empty high street premises, which could support thousands of new businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is committed to rejuvenating the high street. A multi-million pound strategy is backing local partnerships such as Portas Pilots and Town Teams to breathe new life into their town centres. This includes a doubling of small business rate relief; mentoring from retail experts; and workshops to address town centre challenges. A guide to opening a pop-up will be published soon and StartUp Britain has published a tool kit today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is providing over £80 million of start-up loans for young entrepreneurs, which could create over 30,000 new businesses. Ministers are also changing planning restrictions so that landlords can alter how an empty shop is used for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these steps will make it easier for start-ups to find other low-cost stores to set up in. Last year 450,000 people set up new businesses and almost two thirds of new start-ups say they would benefit from trading on the high street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are absolutely determined to support the high street and we know pop-ups are a great way to bring empty shops back to life and get new businesses going, so we thought ‘why not open one right here in the department?’. It will also showcase how we can unleash more of our best and brightest young entrepreneurs onto the country’s high streets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma Jones, co-founder of StartUp Britain, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The PopUp Britain model gives retail entrepreneurs an affordable opportunity to scale up their businesses and become a part of their own high street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing record numbers of people setting up businesses and they are starting out small and online. They are the driving force of the economy. This initiative offers them a chance to physically test out new markets as well as get their products in front of consumers and big buyers in a way that has never been available to them before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By actively encouraging local authorities to give start-ups access to empty shops across Britain, we hope it will help accelerate British enterprise as well as providing a vibrant addition to the local British shopping experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a real appetite in our town centres to get them revitalised so they remain attractive places to visit. And it’s not just talk: there are many extremely capable and serious people with some superb ideas; but they need a bit of help to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pop-up shops are a superb way for all sorts of entrepreneurs to test their ideas. So I’m delighted that this department is opening the first pop-up shop in Whitehall and I look forward to inviting all 27 Portas Pilots and 330 Towns Teams here to see how they could replicate this model across the country in the new year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Apprentice’ winning entrepreneur Tim Campbell added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a brilliant idea and it is great to see the government actively supporting business in this way. For many aspiring and growing enterprises, having access to a retail unit where new propositions and ideas can be tested directly with customers can be the catalyst to increase sales. I hope other landlords follow this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At the Bright Ideas Trust, where we invest in businesses started by young unemployed people, we see many business struggle to secure retail space as they grow out of their bedrooms and away from their kitchen tables.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="startup-britain"&gt;StartUp Britain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.startupbritain.co/"&gt;StartUp Britain&lt;/a&gt; is a national campaign by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs, harnessing the expertise and passion of Britain’s leading businesspeople to celebrate, inspire and accelerate enterprise in the UK. The campaign was founded by eight entrepreneurs and was launched in March 2011 by the Prime Minister. It has successfully run pop-up stores in Richmond, Surrey, which opened in July and which have already helped 42 businesses get access to the high street. Four in five of the tenants said the experience had been good for their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="first-six-pop-up-britain-victoria-tenants"&gt;First six pop-up Britain Victoria tenants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established 6 months ago by 27-year-old Shrewsbury-based designer Sarah McLeod, silk scarf company &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nanukk.com/"&gt;NANUKK&lt;/a&gt; features beautiful pieces of Art printed onto silk fabrics. All the scarves are made in England. Sarah has been labelled as one to watch, after she was awarded the River Island Graduate Fashion Week Award in 2008. 
Sarah said: “It will be great to have a physical presence in the marketplace at last! So far I’ve only been online. People will love the feel of my silk scarves and I hope it will make them buy. I’m so excited!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.millaandarti.co.uk/"&gt;Milla &amp;amp; Arti&lt;/a&gt; was set up by product design consultant Deborah Reyner 18 months ago. Her British-made homeware collection includes bespoke lavender hearts for weddings, patchwork kits, gift ties and ribbons, collars and bows. 
Deborah said: “This is a wonderful opportunity for Milla &amp;amp; Arti and to talk about my products which are made by the British seaside and get people interested in making and doing themselves. I haven’t been able to sleep for a week before this, I’m so excited!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brother and sister Mark and Clare Lissaman named their ethical organic cotton men’s shirt company after their grafting grandfathers. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.arthurandhenry.com/"&gt;Arthur &amp;amp; Henry&lt;/a&gt; was developed after ethical consultant Clare noticed there were no ethical formal shirts on the market. “I was at the World Congress on Organic Cotton a few years back and realised that although all the men attending were passionate about organic cotton - none were actually wearing any as they were all suited up and couldn’t find proper smart shirts in organic cotton,” Clare, from Islington, said. “So we thought we’d make some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re thrilled and delighted to have this opportunity. For a newly established, ethical menswear brand, this is an amazing opportunity to meet customers face-to-face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single mum and former interior designer Esther Gibbs, from Chiswick, created &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.londonmummy.com/"&gt;London Mummy&lt;/a&gt; after people kept asking her where she bought the cushions and accessories she had made herself. All her products are now either made in England – some by Esther herself - or by women’s collectives in China. Her handpicked selection includes retro bed linen, colourful crochet animals, quirky kids’ stationery, classic toys and games, funky lunchboxes, wall art and more. Esther also makes beautiful children’s fabrics, which she sells in store too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther said: “I sell online but I’ll sell much more in the shop. Once people understand what the shop is about and what it’s doing for small British businesses, it will be a great asset for the high street and small businesses. I’m delighted to be involved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sock entrepreneur Philip Morrow, 25, started &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.morrowsoutfitters.com/"&gt;Morrow’s Outfitters&lt;/a&gt; last year as a way to re-establish his great-grandfather’s former gentlemen’s outfitters shop that operated in Liverpool between 1912 and 1987. His range of Loughborough-made cotton socks come in over 40 designs and colours. 
Phillip said: “Pop-up shops make a great deal of sense for small online businesses such as mine. I’m over the moon about getting the opportunity to come into PopUp Britain in Victoria.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full-time English teacher and designer Alia Qadir, 30, from Ealing, started &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.theenglishteeshop.com/"&gt;The English Tee Shop&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to combine her passion for fashion and love of grammar! All her cotton is English-made and printed. She sells online and runs her business part-time from home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alia said: “Until now I have relied on my online presence to sell my brand. But my T-shirts are made from a really good quality, soft jersey, and that doesn’t come across online. I’m really delighted about this new pop-up adventure!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="new-town-team-tool-kit"&gt;New Town team tool kit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the prototype shopping concept comes a newly-developed pop-up-specific tool kit for Town Teams to implement, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a national pop-up lease&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a central website with information about the initiative for town teams and new businesses interested in applying for a slot at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.popupbritain.com"&gt;www.popupbritain.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;access to free pop-up payment equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a step-by-step guide for setting up a PopUp Britain shop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PopUp Britain branding to make the shop recognisable to the consumer as a place where they can support British enterprise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="portas-pilots"&gt;Portas Pilots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking forward the first recommendation from Mary Portas’s high street review, the department is running a number of high street Town Team Portas Pilots in England. We’re encouraging local partnerships and consortiums to come up with innovative ideas about how to transform their local high street into a social place, bustling with people, services and jobs. Twelve town centres from across England were selected as the first Portas Pilots Town Teams in May, and 15 more in July, with three from London, bringing the total to 27. They each receive up to £100,000 of funding plus support from Government and retail expert Mary Portas. More detail can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-high-streets-and-town-centres"&gt;Improving high streets and town centres pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="town-teams"&gt;Town Teams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 330 Town Team Partners support includes: an advice line and a network of advisers managed by the Association of Town Centre Management; special national events to learn from other Town Teams, and support from industry experts and trade bodies including an online ‘Knowledge Bank’ with expert advice; regular meetings with other Town Teams to share tips and ideas; and ‘Crowdfunding’ - a potential way to attract local investors and raise small amounts of finance to support their work. All Town Team Partners will also benefit from a Government-sponsored fund designed to help towards getting their plans off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2241696.xls"&gt;List of Town Team Partners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="statistics"&gt;Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key statistics and evidence on start-ups in the UK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011 saw a record high for start-ups: over 450,000 people set up a company
 and became their own boss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a StartUp Britain poll revealed 82% of start-ups found the pop-up experience was valuable for their business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the UK, there are 4.8 million private sector companies employing an estimated 23.9 million people with a turnover of £3,100 billion. Small and medium-sized enterprises also account for almost half of the net growth in jobs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium, 11.3% of shop premises in UK town centres are now vacant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;according to research from StartUp Britain, 63% of businesses not already on the high street think their business would benefit from a high street presence and, of these, 88% believe funding is the biggest barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="additional-quotes"&gt;Additional quotes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke Johnson, Chairman of StartUp Britain, former Pizza Express boss and Chairman and part-owner of Patisserie Valerie and Giraffe, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A new high street name that will become synonymous with buying British and supporting small British enterprise is a fantastic idea. I’m sure PopUp Britain will be embraced by town planners and local government as a way to offer tangible support to their own high streets and start-up communities.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Russell, Chief Executive of WeArePopUp, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pop-ups are ideal incubators for the next generation of entrepreneurs. It’s very encouraging to see the Government opening a national showcase in a high-profile location such as Cardinal Place in Victoria. Pop-ups can change the fortunes of local communities and we look forward to this support encouraging more landlords to open up their empty shops and become part of the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosie Cann, Director at Popupspace, a property consultancy that specialises in pop ups, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We find space for lots of established retailers, but the challenges for new businesses wanting to open shops are much wider. What we have here is a unique offering to smaller start-ups looking for affordable space to sell, but also for business support and a high profile.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Little, UK Managing Director of Intuit, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pop-up tenants need to be able to accept card payments but it can take weeks to get set up, the equipment and transactions can be expensive and require long-term contracts. Intuit is proud to support PopUp Britain with Intuit Pay, giving start-up retailers a way to get set up in minutes to securely take card payments on their smart phone or tablet – with no commitment and no contracts. With Intuit Pay anyone can now accept card payments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Prisk sets out government support for "lifeline shops"</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the Association of Convenience Stores, Mr Prisk described them as a vital service for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He warned against overlooking the crucial role the army of small shopkeepers across the country plays not only economically but also socially - offering a friendly face and social hub to local communities, and especially older people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister pointed to research suggesting that around a quarter of elderly people use their local shop, often a convenience store, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convenience stores represent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;almost 40% of all rural shops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;over a third of shops in urban areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a quarter of all shops in the suburbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the age of supermarkets and online retail it’s easy to forget that convenience stores make up more than quarter of all shops. Yet they are not just an important part of the economy. For many people their local shop is also a lifeline. Whether they’re used for daily supplies or the occasional pint of milk, they are an essential part of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s why this government is introducing measures specifically designed to support convenience stores. That means reforming the planning system, easing the financial pressures with business rate support, and offering practical ways to attract new custom, all in order to keep this vital local resource intact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-support-to-convenience-stores"&gt;Government support to convenience stores&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk acknowledged the new economic challenges traditional shops now face, especially the changing way that people shop - whether online or in out-of-town retail outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he also highlighted some of the key actions the government is taking to help them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the government’s work to cut the deficit by a quarter in 2 years, which has kept interest rates lower for longer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;new changes to the planning system to ensure that existing town centres should be the first preference for new retail facilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expert support and a multi-million pound fund for Portas Pilots and Town Team Partners will encourage strong and bold local leadership to create competitive high streets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;doubled small business rates relief and a 20% reduction of corporation tax are helping smaller firms manage their bills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a delayed business rate revaluation, providing a more stable business environment and preventing an increase in rates for around 800,000 premises &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plans to help town centres adapt to changing demands, making it easier to convert empty offices into homes and bringing people back into the town centre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title> Heart of the Community conference 2012</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be able to join you at this, my third Association of Convenience Stores conference, though I don’t think that earns me a Crackerjack pen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would like to pay tribute to James Lowman and the work of the Association. Whilst we have not always agreed, I have always found James to be both persistent and effective, in putting your case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it was following talks with James that I pressed for, and secured, a 3 year moratorium for small shops from the tobacco display ban, (much to the chagrin of the supermarket groups!). This was partly because of the points James made on how a convenience store is run, so his knowledge is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tough-times"&gt;Tough times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that I recognise as someone who has been involved with business, and the government recognises, that these are tough times for retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer incomes are under continuing pressure. The uncertainty in the Eurozone has prolonged the credit crunch. And of course there is increasing competition, which only squeezes your already tight margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, alongside the established competition from the supermarkets and out of town centres, we are also seeing a long term shift in consumer habits, as the online market grows. In fact, I was looking at the numbers and online sales have doubled in the last decade, to make up 10% of UK retail sales. That trend is only going to continue, and begs real challenges for all of you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in consumer habits is not wholly bad for smaller bricks and mortar retailers. Indeed it has been shown to actively help specialists or those with a particular offer to reach much wider markets. But it means that the question for all retailers is no longer whether you should adapt your business, but how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very important shift which we in government must respond to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="value-of-convenience-sector"&gt;Value of convenience sector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In government, we recognise the economic worth of the retail sector, both by turnover and measured by the number and type of jobs. Retailing is, for example, one of the most important ‘first’ employers, with a third of all retail employees, aged under 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is also a social value in small shops, (and particularly in the convenience sector) which we should not ignore, as indeed your research has shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A local convenience store is often one of the few places, where people meet and talk today. In villages and on many estates, it’s you and it’s your staff who know the local community, (and make time to talk to the elderly.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representing 40% of all rural shops (and a third of shops in our towns), it’s the convenience sector which is usually there for a whole range of customers - perhaps those who don’t have a car, for young families, and for the elderly. It’s not to say that you aren’t economically important, but I also recognise the social benefit of a diverse, convenience sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, both as a constituency MP and as a member of Parliament, as well as a user of my local convenience store, and on behalf of the many customers who rely on the service and care you and your staff provide, let me say thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-can-be-done-to-help"&gt;What can be done to help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a former businessman, I understand that of course empathy doesn’t pay your bills, or help you compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I would like to do if I can, is explain what we’re doing in government to help business generally, and retailing in particular, to weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I think it’s important that we have been able to keep interest rates lower for substantially longer, by cutting the financial deficit by a quarter. The fact that we’ve been able to do this over the last 2 and a half years is vital. Clearly, there’s a difference between what we the government and you as retailers can borrow, but if we had continued to borrow, interest rates would have soared, crippling businesses and families alike. We can all see what that means, when we look abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So low interest rates have helped. But the government has also acted to cut your costs. We have cut corporation tax rates to 24 pence for larger firms, and to 20 pence for smaller businesses. And we have reversed plans to increase National Insurance contributions, which would have hit jobs hard. The Association of Convenience Stores were amongst those who helped to make that point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we came into office, we also acted to help cut business rate bills. It’s why we extended and doubled the small business rates relief that’s helped thousands of small shops pay their bills, and it’s why we have now given councils new powers to discount rates, (funded locally), to help those firms which are struggling. It’s a new power, only a few months old, and only a few councils have taken it up. I am sure the association will want to change that. In fact, your own submission to the Treasury says that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s there, now all they need to do is use it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, our financial room for manoeuvre is very limited but we are listening carefully to your concerns and will try and help where we can. However, as I’d like to remain a minister, I won’t pre-empt the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we have delayed the planned revaluation from 2015 to 2017. This is an important issue. Let me explain our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we know that the last thing businesses needed right now, is the uncertainty which a revaluation would create. You get your valuation, there’s the counter valuation, appeals which leads to 18 months of uncertainty. It isn’t the right time to be doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we looked carefully at the independent evidence produced by the Valuation Office Agency as to who the likely winners and losers would be. We were and you might be surprised by the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Valuation Office Agency’s analysis shows that some 800,000 premises would have seen a real term increase in their rates bill, with roughly 300,000 benefitting. Indeed many of the businesses represented here would have seen big hikes, in some cases up to 28%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems counter-intuitive, but the reason for this, is that because the revaluation must be revenue neutral, to compensate for lower rateable values, the tax rate would have to increase by approximately 20%. As a result, many businesses whose rents have fallen by less than the national average, which is how it is balanced, would have seen business rate bill goes up from 2015. We have asked business to come in so that we can explain how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we felt, on balance, that now is not the time to be making this revaluation and in doing so we believe we can help many businesses in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that for many people, they think, ‘my rents have gone up’ but because there are 2 elements to business rates it doesn’t quite work like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="town-centres-need-to-compete"&gt;Town centres need to compete&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not just individual shops that need help. It’s also the traditional high street and many of our town centres. And our role should not be not to protect, but to enable. To ensure that our high streets are able to adapt to changing markets and consumer habits, so you can compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why last year the Prime Minister asked Mary Portas to review what needs to be done, by government, by local authorities and by business itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has produced an excellent report and brought her typical real energy and a keen consumer eye to the towns wanting to pilot this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s actually happening on the ground?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, our Town Centres First policy is an important and explicit part of our new National Planning Policy Framework. What it means in practice is that town centres should be the first preference for new retail outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we want to reform, planning to help town centres adapt. This means making it easier for the conversion of redundant first floors into homes, and secondly to enable empty offices that can often blight some high streets to also be converted into homes. Both these measures will bring people back into the town centre, increase footfall and so help existing retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we believe that strong local leadership is vital if towns are to be renewed. That is the clear lesson from both the Portas pilots and what we see regularly from successful shopping centres, who manage the whole customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If struggling high streets and town centres are to compete, they need the right people to deal with the promotion, management and coordination of their ‘centre’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why we announced last month the creation of over 320 town team partners, who will get the expert advice, mentoring and support they need, to get an effective business plan in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently went to Deptford, where I met the leaders of their town team, who are using one-stop shops and community cafés to make the most of what they feel is their unique selling point - its significant cluster of local artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuacApa2aUE"&gt;Deptford visit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They plan to bring benefits to the entire high street, install art in the high street and set up shops as galleries under the ‘Made in Deptford’ banner to bring more people in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really encouraging visit and just shows what together local civic and business leaders working as a partnership can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="physical-change"&gt;Physical change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course if towns are to compete, they need to address other issues than those I mentioned: from actively promoting local markets; through to being innovative, when managing and charging for local parking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, lets be honest many need to change their appearance. And getting empty shops occupied is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why my predecessor Grant Shapps provided a £10 million High Street Innovation Fund, specifically to help those areas with the worst levels of empty shops. We’re already starting to see this helping to bring run down shops back into use, with other businesses kicking off as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think we can do more. The pop up shop movement, which helps new businesses set up and sell, is a great idea. Its something I want to impress on both landlords and tenants, and see expand right across the country, not least as it helps new firms start and will generate additional footfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I am in talks with the Pop Up Britain team, led by Emma Jones, to see how we in government can help promote pop up shops across the country, and I hope to have something positive to say about it very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-next-step"&gt;The next step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I hope you can see, as a government we believe that much can be done to help retailers and our town centres compete. But it has to be a collaborative effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government, councils, businesses and local people (especially) need to be engaged and feel that they can make a difference. This involves a long term shift and short term squeeze. This won’t be easy and many towns will struggle, especially where that sense of collaboration is missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it can be done. As the people in Deptford have shown, if there’s the right imagination, will and support our high streets can have a great future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be different to what went before, but it’s vital that once again our town centres regain their role, at the heart of our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Mark Prisk urges shoppers: "love your local market"</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Growth Minister Mark Prisk called on communities and budding entrepreneurs to back their local markets well into the New Year, as part of a wider effort to breathe new life into the nation’s high streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister confirmed that the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.loveyourlocalmarket.org.uk/" title="Love Your Local Market"&gt;Love Your Local Market&lt;/a&gt; campaign in 2013 will take place from 15 May, and will give aspiring retailers the chance to test out their ideas at their local markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Love Your Local Market campaign, new stallholders will be able to take advantage of a ‘Table for a Tenner’ deal - with some offering free pitches - at markets across the country, with many offering mentoring to those setting up shop for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to make sure as many high streets as possible can take part, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nabma.com/your-local-market/" title="National Association of British Market Authorities"&gt;National Association of British Market Authorities&lt;/a&gt; will hold a series of roadshows sharing ideas that councils and other market operators can take to make their events a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 400 local markets across the country were involved this summer, with a locally-defined programme of events designed to attract visitors into town centres and help new start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Markets can play an integral role in reviving our high streets, offering something new and exciting for shoppers in a way the Internet and out-of-town retail centres can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would urge traders and councils across the country to back this effective and important campaign, offer support to budding entrepreneurs looking to trade and Love Your Local Market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham Wilson, OBE, Chief Executive of the National Association of British Market Authorities, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Love Your Local Market and National Market Day provided a great impetus to the campaign to revitalise the high street and created an opportunity for almost 2000 people to sample market trading for the first time. We now want to build on this success and make LYLM 2013 bigger and better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Harrison, Chief Executive of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nmtf.co.uk/" title="National Market Traders Association"&gt;National Market Traders’ Federation&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We, at the National Market Traders’ Federation, are happy to see this campaign running again for a second year, and are delighted to support it. We do hope it has an even bigger impact than the first event with regard to the encouragement of new start-up businesses within the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="following-up-on-a-successful-fortnight"&gt;Following up on a successful fortnight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows the success of the Love Your Local Markets event in June this year, which saw over 400 markets run over the dedicated 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this scheme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;around 400 markets took part under the Love Your Local Markets banner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;just under 2,000 new traders joined local markets during last year’s campaign&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;over 3,000 ‘Tables for a Tenner’ and free pitches were offered - over half of which were taken up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah Rogers, whose chocolate stall is now a regular fixture at Ludlow Market, with visitors now looking to buy her products online and making bookings for her to cater weddings and other events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obi Nwosu, who started selling during Love Your Local Market at Portobello in London, and now has stalls in six locations across the Capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keith Smith, who started his Natural Ingredients stall at Fleetwood Market earlier this year, but is now trading on every market day of the week, and sell into retail outlets including food halls and other local specialist markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>More Green Flag Awards for great local parks</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Green Flag Awards - an annual ‘MOT’ inspection for parks on aspects like safety and cleanliness - are to continue as Communities Minister Don Foster announces that Keep Britain Tidy has been awarded the licence to run the scheme for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First launched in 1996 the scheme has rewarded thousands of flags over the years, with a record number 1,424 sites receiving the award this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Foster said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As thousands of tourists during the Olympics saw for themselves we have some of the greatest parks in the world in this country and I want to keep the standard very high.  This is why the government is pleased to announce that Keep Britain Tidy will continue to run the scheme, awarding green flags to those parks that provide great spaces for local people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Open spaces are essential in bringing people of all ages and backgrounds together, and are particularly important for the millions of people who do not have the luxury of their own garden to relax in or for their children to play in.  Green flags will continue to reward great parks across the country and challenge all the others to do even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as parks the green flag award scheme is open to any freely accessible public open space, including woodlands, nature reserves, allotments and cemeteries.  Judging is carried out by an army of volunteer judges and parks that receive lottery funding are required to achieve green flag status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking today at the UK Parks Summit in London, organised by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Big Lottery Fund, Don Foster is also welcoming additional lottery funding to support parks saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that £100million of extra lottery money will be going to support parks over the next three years, getting local people involved and protecting historic monuments.  With the continuing green flags scheme these new measures are a real boost for the country’s parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep Britain Tidy Chief Executive Phil Barton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On behalf of the partners involved I’d like to say how thrilled we are to have won the licence to run the Green Flag Awards for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We know how important this scheme is to the army of professional men and women who manage our green spaces across the country. We also understand that, in these difficult financial times, these professionals are facing significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is only by working together that we can maintain the high standards set by the Green Flag Award and it is against this backdrop that we are delighted to be working with key partners who will help strengthen the scheme. Through this partnership, we will continue to spread best practice and raise the standard of our parks and green spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new partnership believes the Green Flag Award is a model of how, by sharing good practice and celebrating and rewarding quality, we can raise the standards of public space in the UK, providing a range of benefits for local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dame Jenny Abramsky, Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m delighted the Minister has made this commitment to the future of the Green Flags Awards scheme as it plays a vital role in inspiring local authorities and community groups to maintain their parks. Since 1996, the Heritage Lottery Fund and Big Lottery Fund have jointly invested over £640million to transform over 700 public open spaces.  The continuation of the Award - which we regard as a mark of quality all parks we fund must meet - will help safeguard our past investment along with our new commitment of £100million over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Ainsworth, Chair of the Big Lottery Fund said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is great news and encouraging evidence of the government’s commitment to the quality of places and spaces where people live, work and play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep Britain Tidy has been running the Green Flag Award scheme since 2009, with the contract expiring this year.  DCLG advertised the opportunity to run the scheme under licence and invited bids during the summer.  We are today confirming Keep Britain Tidy has been successful in its bid to become the licence holder for the scheme over the next five years.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New support to help 'Town Team Partners' transform their high streets</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of towns across the country are being offered support that will help them revitalise their high streets, Local Growth Minister Mark Prisk announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following applications by local MPs, over 300 Town Teams have signed up to become &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/townteampartners/"&gt;Town Team Partners&lt;/a&gt;, and will benefit from a package of support, which includes help from the Government as well as advice and support from leading retail experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Town Teams Partners will receive an immediate boost, with national event to be held in Birmingham tomorrow by the Association of Town Centre Managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said the extra support would help the teams to strengthen their leadership on the ground, and enable them to try new ideas on their high streets to make them more attractive and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="designs-for-deptford"&gt;Designs for Deptford&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mark the announcement the Minister visited Deptford, a successful applicant to become a Town Team Partner. The team have plans to use the creative buzz generated by local artists by installing their art works in the high street and in local shops - from boutiques to the local fishmongers -  all under the ‘Made in Deptford’ banner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk also saw the Deptford Project, a railway carriage that has been transformed into a cafe - a great example of how the Town Team Partner plans to transform the look of the high street and showcase local talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UuacApa2aUE?rel=0;showinfo=0" alt="iframe: "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS Word, 27 kb&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Growth Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a real hunger in town centres across the country for them to be revitalised and remain attractive places to visit. So I’m delighted that from today over 300 Town Team Partners will begin to receive a package of support that helps them breathe new life into their high streets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No one’s pretending that there’s a silver bullet for improving the performance of our town centres. Yet as I saw in Deptford: with this new support, and the opportunity to learn from each other, Town Teams can channel their energy and enthusiasm into promoting a more exciting and competitive offer on our high-streets, and help them thrive for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="package-of-support"&gt;Package of support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to become a Town Team Partner received an overwhelming response from towns across the country, with hundreds of MPs submitting applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Town Team Partner will have access to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;help to get started and become established in their town&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an advice line and a network of advisers managed by the Association of Town Centre Management&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;special national events to learn from other Town Teams, and secure support from industry experts and trade bodies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an online ‘Knowledge Bank’ with expert advice and support&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;regular meetings with other Town Teams to share tips and ideas, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Crowdfunding’ - a potential way to attract local investors and raise small amounts of finance to support their work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Town Team Partners will also benefit from a Government-sponsored fund designed to help towards getting their plans off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of Town Team Partners is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2241696.xls"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2241696.xls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="high-street-x-factor"&gt;High Street x-factor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Town centres also have the opportunity to win the £1million &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/economicgrowth/highstreetsportas/"&gt;Future High Street X-Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize will be shared among the high streets that show the greatest improvements. Towns will be judged by an independent expert panel, for the inventiveness of their schemes and evidence of their impact, such as increased footfall or turnover, or improved skills and employment levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towns will also need to explain how they plan to use their prize money to further support their high streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Heart of Stoke-on-Trent set for dramatic transformation</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Midlands European Regional Development Fund Programme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans to transform the city of Stoke-on-Trent into a thriving and successful centre are well underway thanks to a fresh injection of funding and an ambitious vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements will help enhance the image and appeal of the city to businesses, attracting fresh inward investment and job opportunities, and also help join up other developments taking place around the city from the Central Business District through to the Mitchell Memorial Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public realm improvements, supported by £2.1million from the European Regional Development Fund, which is managed by the Department for Communities and Local Government and matched by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, are part of a package of improvements to develop and upgrade the city centre - creating a legacy for local people and making it more attractive to potential new investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Baroness Hanham CBE said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To improve the overall perception and performance of an area you have to get the foundations right. Stoke-on-Trent city centre is in great need of regeneration to ensure its future is prosperous. This has already started with key developments taking place in city and I am delighted that we are able to offer funding support to activities which complement these developments. From new street furniture to landscaped areas the changes planned will help create an attractive, vibrant and welcoming environment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As well as creating something special for local people, I also hope this investment will send a clear signal to private sector investors, helping to continue the much needed and on-going regeneration of the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents, workers and visitors alike will be able to enjoy newly landscaped public spaces and street furniture, creating an attractive environment. The improvements will focus on the areas of Tontine Street, Percy Street and Stafford Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillor Ruth Rosenau, Stoke-on-Trent City Council cabinet member for regeneration, planning and transport, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re delighted to mark the start of these long-awaited works. It’s a very exciting project. It will give the area a contemporary city style and feel, but retain its very special character and heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The area will become much more attractive and provide a more welcoming shopping environment, with natural stone paving and granite benches with ceramic detailing, plus new lighting, signs and trees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s around 25 years since work on this scale and quality was last done in the area so it’s literally getting its biggest makeover in a generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more about activities set for Stoke-on-Trent, contact Ciara Hill in Stoke-on-Trent City Council Press Office on 01782 232130 or e-mail &lt;a href="mailto:ciara.hill@stoke.gov.uk"&gt;ciara.hill@stoke.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government is the managing authority for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Programme which runs from 2007 to 2013.

    <title>Minister in 'Buy British' call</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Government Minister Don Foster today encouraged the public to ‘Buy British’ and recognise the importance of home-grown produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Foster hailed the growth of the nation’s farmers’ markets in recent years but said more can be done to support both high streets and the agricultural economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Harvest festival approaches he pledged to make it a priority in his new role to build on the success of the Government’s Love Your Local Market campaign and back British products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Foster was speaking on a visit to Brighton farmers market during the ‘Organic September’ month organised by the National Farmers Retail and Markets Association and ahead of their annual conference in Harrogate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging the public to buy British produce from their local Farmers Market will not only benefit the country’s farmers but will also help regenerate high streets and town squares as they see an increase in footfall to surrounding shops and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has been driving the regeneration and growth of the nation’s high streets through Portas Pilots, Enterprise Zones and by keeping business rates low for small business owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets Minister Don Foster said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In my own town of Bath we are proud to have had the country’s first Farmers Market and their success continues to literally bring home the bacon for British Farmers and their produce. Markets are a British institution - the familiar cry of ‘pound for a pound’ echoing across town squares.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Harvest festivals will be in full swing in the coming weeks and I’m encouraging the public to visit the nearest market this weekend and ‘Buy British’ - they’ll be impressed by the great value and great taste of the produce on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Common sense planning reform to create more homes and boost the high street</title>
    <category>News Article</category>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has approved a new measure that will increase the number of homes in town centres and help increase footfall on high streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New planning rights will allow more flats to be created above shops without the need for planning permission. Two flats will be allowed to be created in office or storage space under new permitted development rights coming into force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change further streamlines the planning system, making it easier, quicker and cheaper for people to create new homes in existing underused space. It has the potential to help increase the amount of affordable housing and ensures better use is made of existing developed land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relaxing planning restrictions on creating flats above shops can also help increase the vitality of town centres by increasing footfall and providing a boost to high street regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are common sense planning reforms that will deliver more affordable homes in areas where there are good transport links whilst ensuring better use of existing developed land.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Cutting this red tape should be a shot in the arm for the high street increasing footfall and providing a boost to regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning Minister Greg Clark Mr Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government is determined to make the very best use of existing buildings to provide more homes as quickly and simply as possible. This change offers real potential to provide more affordable housing and give a much needed boost to our high streets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ensuring unused space above shops can be used in a better way is one of the many changes the Government has introduced to streamline the planning system and to cut unnecessary bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also announced proposed measures to simplify the planning system further by making it easier to temporarily re-use some buildings without needing planning permission, streamlining the paper work needed for planning applications and speeding up planning appeal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has also outlined a package of measures to help high streets reclaim their role at the heart of our communities. These include encouraging town centres to become Town Team partners to benefit from the support and advice available from the Government and leading retail experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change in permitted development rights applies to A1 (retail units) and A2 (financial/professional services units) commercial properties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current legislation only allows for one flat to be created above a shop without the need for a planning application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new permitted development rights will come into force on 1 October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
