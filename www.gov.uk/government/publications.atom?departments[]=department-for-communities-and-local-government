    <title>Firefighters' pension scheme: increases to employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statutory consultation seeks views on the proposed increase in employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013 for members of the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (1992) and New Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also considered the impact of the proposed 2013 to 2014 pension contribution increases on protected groups (like older scheme members, those on maternity leave or part time workers) and this is set out in the partial equality statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Amendments to the new firefighters' pension scheme 2006: automatic enrolment</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation covers amendments to the new firefighters’ pension scheme, as set out in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3432/made"&gt;Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) Order 2006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so that fire and rescue authorities can comply with their duties for automatic enrolment under workplace pension reform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local authority revenue expenditure and financing in England: 2011 to 2012 final outturn</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the final outturn estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for 2011-12 were released on 27 November 2012 under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue expenditure by local authorities in England was £99.3 billion in 2011-12, a decrease from £104.3 billion in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26.6% of revenue expenditure in 2011-12 was funded through council tax, 29.7% through formula grant and 46.1% through specific grants inside aggregate external finance and local services support grant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12 local authorities added £2.6 billion to their reserves. This includes figures for the Greater London Authority (GLA), who added £0.6 billion to their reserves. Excluding GLA, authorities added £2.0 billion to their reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities net current expenditure for education services was £40.2 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education expenditure for 2011-12 is not comparable to previous years due to a number of schools changing their status to become academies, which are centrally funded rather than funded by local authorities. There has also been a transfer of responsibilities between the NHS and local government relating to adults with learning difficulties in long stay NHS institutions. As a result of this discontinuity between the two financial years (2010-11 and 2011-12), it is difficult to compare total net current expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nationally significant infrastructure planning: expanding and improving the ‘one stop shop’ approach for consents</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 6 September 2012, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister set out a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-boost-british-housebuilding-jobs-and-the-economy"&gt;major package of reforms to housing and planning&lt;/a&gt; to help create conditions for economic growth. This announcement included a commitment to ‘work to extend the principle of a one-stop-shop for non-planning consents for major infrastructure’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this consultation is to seek views from interested bodies on what consents should be moved within the scope of an expanded ‘one stop shop’ for major infrastructure and on proposals for streamlining the current list of statutory consultees that developers are required to consult before applying for a development consent order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate consultation we are seeking views on proposals to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/nationally-significant-infrastructure-planning-extending-the-regime-to-business-and-commercial-projects"&gt;extend the nationally significant infrastructure planning regime to business and commercial projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nationally significant infrastructure planning: extending the regime to business and commercial projects</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help speed up planning decisions for the most complex projects and to increase choice for developers, the government proposes to extend the scope of the Planning Act 2008 so that a wider range of development can be brought within the nationally significant infrastructure planning regime. This will allow developers of nationally significant business or commercial projects to apply to the Secretary of State for the option of using the streamlined planning regime set out in the Planning Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views about the proposal to extend the nationally significant infrastructure regime and, in particular, about the types and forms of business and commercial projects to be prescribed in regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A better deal for mobile home owners</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes a number of reforms to the park homes sector, aimed at tackling a number of complaints made by residents of some mobile home site operators. These can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking an owner’s sale of their home - without justifiable reason&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charging excessive pitch fees, breaching site rules and stopping owners from improving their homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are designed to ensure site operators who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already whilst the rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring compliance with site licence conditions by enabling the courts to impose unlimited fines on operators who do not manage their sites properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing local authorities to make a reasonable charge on site operators for their licensing services, which they are currently unable to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving local authorities the power to carry out works on sites in an emergency or where the site operator has been found guilty of a breach of the licence, and charge the cost back to them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening the rules around the sale of mobile homes so that unscrupulous operators cannot interfere with owners selling to a qualifying buyer who they have chosen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changing legislation to improve other residents’ rights to reflect their status as home owners by, for example, allowing them to carry out home improvements without seeking permission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
