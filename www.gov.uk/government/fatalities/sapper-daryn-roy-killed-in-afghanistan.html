<h2 id="sapper-daryn-roy">Sapper Daryn Roy</h2>

<p>Sapper Daryn Roy, aged 28, originally from Consett, County Durham, enlisted in the Royal Engineers on 4 October 2005 as a combat signaller. After completing combat engineer and combat signaller courses he joined 21 Engineer Regiment, who were based in Osnabruck, on 28 September 2006.</p>

<p>Having arrived at 21 Engineer Regiment, Sapper Roy deployed to Iraq on Operation TELIC 11 from November 2007 to May 2008 where he worked as a combat engineer in a section focused mainly on constructing force protection.</p>

<p>During this tour he also successfully completed additional combat engineer and combat signaller training to upgrade to a higher qualification. After TELIC 11, and with the regiment now based in Ripon, he passed the potential Junior Non-Commissioned Officers’ cadre in October 2009.</p>

<p>He was due to be posted as a Lance Corporal to 101 Engineer Regiment EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) in June.</p>

<p>Sapper Roy deployed on Operation HERRICK 12 in March 2010 and was employed on a range of construction and combat engineer tasks both as a section sapper and as a signaller. On 3 May 2010 he was driving in convoy from Camp Bastion to Patrol Base Pimon in the Nad ‘Ali area.</p>

<p>From there the convoy was to meet up with and provide protection for a group of civilian vehicles carrying engineering stores needed for a task at Patrol Base Nahidullah.</p>

<p>Before reaching Patrol Base Pimon, Sapper Roy’s vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device; he was evacuated by helicopter but died of his injuries at the hospital in Camp Bastion.</p>

<p>Sapper Roy’s family made the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will miss Daryn’s happy-go-lucky personality and his cheeky smile so much. He loved the Army and he lived his life without regrets. The whole family wishes to express our deep love and pride for Daryn and celebrate his fantastic life.</p>
</blockquote>

  <figcaption>Sapper Daryn Roy  
[Picture: via MOD]</figcaption></figure><p>Lieutenant Colonel Bobby Walton-Knight, Commanding Officer, 21 Engineer Regiment, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sapper Roy was the most professional of soldiers. He was trained as both a combat engineer and combat signaller and could hold his own with the best at either. He joined the Army later than most and brought with him a sense of maturity and common sense that few could match.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He had quickly proved himself in the regiment, his pursuit of the high standards made him stand out and he was about to move on as a Junior Non-Commissioned Officer. He was always keen to get out on the ground where his expertise was needed most.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He never complained, never moaned; he worked hard, looked after his mates, and made a difference. He was the type of soldier you wanted around and the type you wanted to be around.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sapper Roy summed up all that is good about being a Royal Engineer. He was intelligent, hardworking and resilient. He would turn his hand to any task and demand the best from himself. He was immensely proud to be a Sapper and would do anything to defend his troop.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was like an older brother to the other Sappers; supportive, protective, yet firm when necessary. He was quick-witted, high-spirited and always raised morale. He died serving his country and working with his friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He will be sorely missed by all who knew him. As individuals and as a regiment our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Major Johnny Lacken, Officer Commanding, 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sapper Roy was amongst the most professional soldiers I have worked with. He demanded the most exacting standards from himself; believing that if something was worth doing, it was worth doing properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stoic and unflappable in adversity, he simply got on with his job to the best of his ability. A modest man, he never sought recognition for his talent or his unstinting hard work.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was fiercely proud of his troop and, as one of the more mature Sappers, he was like an older brother to his peers. He was happiest when he was working with and in the company of his mates and this was when his outgoing and lively personality came to the fore.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was intelligent, wily and had a razor-sharp wit. He rarely missed an opportunity to create mischief for his own amusement. He was forthright with his opinions and would defend them to the hilt. It was never dull when he was around and he always raised morale.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sapper Roy died doing a job he loved surrounded by friends who he treated as family. His loss will be particularly felt by the young signallers in the squadron.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fine soldier and the best of men, his death has left a void in the squadron. He will be sorely missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corporal Liam Ord, Section Commander, 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To his mates, Sapper Daz Roy was larger than life and had a quick wit that could not be matched. He was always a loyal lad and ever ready to voice his opinion in support of his mates.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He had a can-do attitude and would never let anything get him down. He had an ever-present sense of humour and would always lift morale in any situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a soldier, he was a privilege to command. He always delivered on time and would strive to achieve the highest standards. He always backed me up and I knew I could totally rely on him. It didn’t matter how cold, wet or tired he was; he always gave his best.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent most weekends travelling up and down the A1 with Daz, mainly talking about football and having to endure his quick wit about Newcastle being relegated to the Championship last season. Given that he was a Geordie, I never understood why he supported Liverpool; he was a huge fan. In the end I gave up asking him why; he used to just smile and say that they were the better team.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was a very sociable lad, popular in the troop and with his mates in Newcastle and Durham. He was excellent company and was always in demand to go out with friends at the weekend. He was a great mate. He will be sorely missed and we will always remember him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secretary of State for Defence, Bob Ainsworth, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was saddened to learn of the death of Sapper Daryn Roy. His colleagues praised him highly for his skill and professionalism as a combat engineer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>His death will be keenly felt by all who knew him, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family and friends.</p>
