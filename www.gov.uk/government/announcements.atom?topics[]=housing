    <title>Funding boost will help "stop the rot" of empty homes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding will bring thousands of additional empty homes back into use across England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communities minister pledged to “stop the rot” that empty homes can bring to blighted neighbourhoods and said that he “wants to go much further” in tackling the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the scheme 5,000 empty, and in many cases derelict, properties will be refurbished and put back onto the market over the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="extending-the-governments-commitment-to-tackling-empty-homes"&gt;Extending the government’s commitment to tackling empty homes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest figures show the number of empty homes dropped from 300,000 in 2009 to 259,000 in 2012, and today’s new funding is in addition to the £160 million ministers have already committed to bringing empty homes back into use. The government has also given councils greater powers to tackle empty homes locally including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing councils to charge up to 150% of the normal Council Tax rate on owners of the most problematic neglected homes from April 2013 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;applying the ‘New Homes Bonus’ to empty homes, with government matching Council Tax proceeds from newly inhabited properties pound for pound, doubling councils’ revenue from these&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the most severe cases, enabling councils to take over the most problematic neglected homes through the use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the beginning of Empty Homes Week Don Foster said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Empty homes blight communities, attract crime and rats and deprive people of available housing. What’s worse this is a vicious circle - one derelict home brings an area down and can lead to more and in places whole communities have been destroyed. I am determined quite literally to stop the rot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This extra money will help communities refurbish empty and abandoned homes, bring in new residents, provide desperately needed extra affordable housing for families and regenerate communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This significant cash injection will help thousands of families in housing need, but will also support local economic growth by providing work for local building firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of organisations including councils, housing associations, community and voluntary groups as well as high street regeneration groups - prioritising the 27 ‘Portas pilot’ towns and 326 town team partners - will be able to bid for a share of the funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are also considering future measures to bring not just homes but empty buildings generally back into use including making it easier to convert commercial into residential property and making more use of space above shops as homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TV presenter, architect, and Independent Empty Homes Adviser George Clarke said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Empty homes are a very serious problem for communities - they cause a loss of housing, produce an increase in crime and bring entire areas down. The government has shown it is equally serious about tackling this problem and I welcome this massive injection of extra cash that will help towns across the country tackle the blight of empty homes and regenerate communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Ireland, Chief Executive at the Empty Homes Agency, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The huge effort people have made this year to get empty homes back into use has been truly inspiring and created a major contribution to housing supply. This week we are celebrating what they have achieved and pushing for changes to make it possible for even more to be achieved next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homes and Communities Agency Chief Executive Pat Ritchie said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tackling empty homes remains a key priority for the Agency. I welcome this additional funding, which has an emphasis on helping to bring empty commercial and non-residential back into use as affordable housing, and will build on the work we are already doing to bring long-term empty homes back into use through our Affordable Homes Programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will be working with our local partners to help meet local need and in doing so, support their efforts to tackle homelessness and regenerate neighbourhoods that are suffering from the blight of empty homes and help to prevent neighbourhood decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bidding guidance will shortly be published on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk" title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;Homes and Communities Agency’s website&lt;/a&gt; for registered providers and at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.grantsadmin.co.uk" title="Grantsadmin"&gt;Grants admin&lt;/a&gt; for community and voluntary groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Empty homes figures can be found &lt;a rel="external" href="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/10605/1815794.xls"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government recently changed the threshold at which Empty Dwelling Management Orders take effect, maintaining councils’ powers to tackle the most problematic properties but preventing heavy handed use against homeowners. For more information see the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pickles-acts-to-protect-the-rights-of-homeowners"&gt;news article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 150% council tax premium for empty homes is part of the measures within the Local Government Finance Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The £300 million funding was part of the 6 September housing and growth package announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eric Pickles visits ‘Hidden Homes’ in Wandsworth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles visited the Rollo housing estate in the London Borough of Wandsworth today (22 November 2012) to see how £3.6 million of government funding is helping the council provide more affordable homes for local families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles unveiled the final 38 affordable new homes of the Hidden Homes initiative that celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Eric Pickles with Council Leader Ravi Govindia and Councillor Paul Ellis" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1168/Rollo2-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Wandsworth Council Leader Ravi Govindia and Councillor Paul Ellis welcome Eric Pickles to the borough to officially unveil the new Hidden Homes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering excellent value-for-money, the cutting-edge programme converts vacant and disused spaces on housing estates - from boiler rooms to storage areas - into modern and attractive affordable homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme has delivered 238 homes in Wandsworth over the past decade. These have been allocated to local families and first time buyers, often on a shared ownership basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hidden Homes approach has provided more affordable homes, and at the same time prevented these redundant spaces from becoming eyesores or potential havens for anti-social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles praised the borough for boosting housing delivery that, in the 12 month period to March 2012, was the highest in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the Wandsworth scheme was a lesson to other councils for delivering more affordable housing, despite the tough economic circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects like Hidden Homes also provide valuable economic regeneration, creating jobs and boosting the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This government is committed to delivering more affordable homes that families need. Our £19.5 billion investment is delivering 170,000 affordable homes, and our FirstBuy and NewBuy schemes are helping families take the next step on the property ladder with just a fraction of the normal deposit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we also want more councils to do more, and adopt innovative solutions like those being pioneered in Wandsworth. Using government and council funding, these Hidden Homes are making a fantastic contribution to the affordable housing landscape and giving families and first time buyers the chance to have their own home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cabinet Member for Housing at Wandsworth Council, Councillor Paul Ellis said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Hidden Homes scheme has played a really major role in increasing the supply of affordable housing over the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As well as proving incredibly cost effective, it has also helped create jobs in the construction sector and been the key to regenerating redundant land on housing estates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that the secretary of state will today unveil its biggest single scheme, and that as a result, 3 dozen families in housing need will be able to move into brand new high quality homes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for Hidden Homes builds on the options available for aspiring homeowners who want to get onto and up the housing ladder. This includes the NewBuy Guarantee and the reinvigorated Right to Buy, which will give thousands of council tenants the opportunity to buy their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos of the visit are available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/sets/72157632071654509/"&gt;DCLG Flickr channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Government frees councils to tackle homelessness</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New laws coming into effect from today will give councils the freedom to help those facing the frightening prospect of homelessness by finding them suitable homes in the private rented sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous rules meant that many homeless households spent long periods in expensive temporary accommodation, turning down offers of good quality private rented accommodation while waiting for social housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said that the new changes would make waiting lists fairer, helping councils fulfil their legal duty to those in need of homelessness help without the extra expense of long-term temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he said the new protections in place today would also ensure that every rented home offered by councils would be good quality suitable accommodation, offered for sufficient time to allow households the space to resolve a homelessness crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homes on offer must meet a set of key standards, and councils will be required to minimise any disruption a move would cause to employment, education or caring responsibilities. This would include considerations such as transport, amenities and medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safeguards include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a current Gas Safety record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any appliances, furnishings and wiring conforming to standards on fire and electrical safety&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the need for a valid Energy Performance Certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a written tenancy agreement that the local authority considers adequate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the council must also be satisfied that the landlord is a ‘fit and proper person’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For too long, councils have been restricted in the way they provided homeless assistance when good quality rented accommodation was available right on their doorstep. Today’s changes will lead to a fairer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The safeguards we’ve put in place today will give vulnerable families the reassurance they need whether they’re housed in the private or social rented sector, and with new freedoms and flexibilities, councils can now fulfil their duty and provide a safe and secure roof for the people who need it most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/council-of-mortgage-lenders-conference"/>
    <title>Council of Mortgage Lenders conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a chartered surveyor, I feel I have some understanding of the housing and the property markets. But I come to this role recognising that, frankly, I still have much to learn, especially about the mortgage market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me start by saying that I want to listen. The considerable expertise gathered here is something I will not ignore. Indeed, it’s experience that I value. There will be times when we won’t always agree, but if we work together, we can make a real difference in quite challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-dysfunctional-market"&gt;A dysfunctional market&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a government we inherited a dysfunctional housing market, whether it’s freehold or leasehold. A market in which (for at least 15 years) we have been building roughly half the homes we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social consequences are considerable. Housing waiting lists have soared in many cities; hundreds of thousands of people been unable to buy or move, and that has seen private sector rents climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also see some 1.6 million young people in their twenties and thirties still living with mum and dad, because they cannot afford their own place. That cannot be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="governments-role"&gt;Government’s role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why I make no apologies for saying that we need more homes, and we need better homes, for more families. More homes for tenants, more homes for owner occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why last November, we set out a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/laying-the-foundations-a-housing-strategy-for-england--2" title="Laying the foundations: a housing strategy for England"&gt;housing strategy&lt;/a&gt; designed to tackle our dysfunctional housing markets in the short and long term, rented or owned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, £19.5 billion is being invested in much-needed affordable housing. We’re doing this slightly differently by working with the private sector. Government has invested £4.5 billion, and a further £15 billion has come through private funding. It means we’re on track to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes, by the end of this Parliament (with some 55,000 supplied last year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we are taking radical steps to inject substantial investment into building homes for the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector--2/supporting-pages/private-rented-sector" title="Private rented sector"&gt;private rented sector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between social homes, the rental sector and private ownership are often overlooked, and we’re trying to bring them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the excellent report from Sir Adrian Montague and his team, we have committed to provide a £10 billion debt guarantee and a £200 million equity finance fund, to help lever in substantial new providers, including some established players from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, we want it to be a bigger, better market, capable of providing tenants with more quality, and more choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we are reforming the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively" title="Making the planning system work more efficiently and effectively "&gt;planning system&lt;/a&gt; and the maze of non-planning building consents. Don’t get me onto the subject of the greater crested newt. We’ve introduced the new, simplified National Planning Policy Framework and we are now looking to strip away much of the bureaucracy around those other consent systems, to enable and speed up sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, we are determined to enable the re-use of previously developed land and of homes lying empty. So we’ve identified surplus government land, capable of providing 100,000 homes, and we’ve already sold land capable for some 33,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more to do in that area, and alongside our multi-million programme to bring empty-homes back into use, the work is starting to provide real dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I think from this can see we are actively pursuing a range of supply side policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="helping-home-buyers"&gt;Helping home buyers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as this audience will know more than many, tackling supply alone, is not enough. We fully recognise that there are serious problems with demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of context, tackling the fiscal deficit we inherited has, of course, been fundamental to our economic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By cutting the deficit by a quarter over the last 2 years, it’s allowed us to retain the confidence of the global market to lend to the UK, and to do so at lower rates, than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that means that interest rates here in the UK have remained lower for longer. But we recognise that consumer confidence remains weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence is, frustratingly, both crucial to the housing and mortgage markets and one of the most difficult things for government to be able to affect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prolonged credit crunch and the continuing uncertainty in the Eurozone has cast a long, dark cloud over all of us, both businesses wanting to invest and families looking to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But practical action can and is being taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Funding for Lending Scheme is now providing a steady flow of credit into the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I gather from some of the major lenders that this is already helping them launch new products, some at a lower price. We’ve seen early signs of increased mortgage approval rates and I hope that continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have now extended the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-people-to-buy-a-home/supporting-pages/help-for-first-time-buyers" title="Help for first-time buyers"&gt;FirstBuy scheme&lt;/a&gt; to help first-time buyers buy new-build homes. In its first year we have seen over 8,500 reservations, with 3,000 sales already completed. It’s why we’ve decided to treble the scheme, to assist up to some 27,000 people. And, of course, by helping first time buyers, we are able to unlock many more housing chains and help many more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we have backed the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/newbuy-guarantee-scheme" title="NewBuy Guarantee scheme"&gt;NewBuy scheme&lt;/a&gt;, run by yourselves and the Home Builders Federation. Acting as a mortgage indemnity scheme, NewBuy started in March and we have already seen over 2,000 reservations. Indeed, the Home Builders Federation estimate the NewBuy scheme will assist some 25,000 families, and as a Government we have made provision for many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all the signs are that, after a cautious start, NewBuy is progressing well, after a cautious start. Savills’ recent research shows that NewBuy mirrors takeup of FirstBuy in its first few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what more can be done? What can government and industry, lenders included, do next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that I value the work of the CML and the work of the lenders represented here today, particularly in regard to repossessions. I want to pay tribute to the work of many lenders and advisers here, who have worked hard to help borrowers who are struggling to pay their mortgage by offering forbearance options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been one of the most encouraging aspects of the recent recession has been that, so far, the level of repossessions has been far lower than in previous downturns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, we’re not complacent. That’s why I’ve extended the Mortgage Rescue Scheme by a further 12 months to March 2014, so that we can help more homeowners (who may be at risk of repossession) to stay in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recognise that the FSA and lending industry have worked constructively together to ensure there are now clear rules arising from the Mortgage Market Review. This is vital if we are to have a stable and healthy housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think there’s still more that the government, and this sector, can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these challenging times we all need to think differently. We need to be challenged in our assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, how as an industry can you bust the myth, that mortgages just aren’t available? You’ve told us that 80% of mortgage applications are accepted, so there’s clearly a gap between the actual mortgage market and what people think is the case. What can you do, together, to change these perceptions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I see many consumer surveys (such as the well-known analysis on Generation Rent by Halifax) suggest that your potential customers are confused, by what’s on offer. How could this sector improve transparency, to make it easier for potential customers to buy your products?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-people-to-buy-a-home/supporting-pages/right-to-buy" title="Right to Buy"&gt;Right to Buy&lt;/a&gt; is back on the agenda, and should be considered afresh. It’s true, the scheme dwindled under the last government, but we have now completely revamped it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential discounts for tenants have radically increased, almost quadrupling in some areas to £75,000. And we have a concerted marketing campaign, which, over the coming months will continue to target hundreds of thousands of households to explain the changes, and how they can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question here is, are you aware of this change? There’s a real opportunity here, right across the country. Are you ready to be part of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps even more importantly, there’s a new market opportunity I want you to bring to your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-build market in this country has historically been tiny to be honest, both numerically, and as a proportion of the overall market. Industry figures suggest that it’s only 1 in 10 new homes that are self-built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, in many other markets the picture is very different. In the USA 45% of all homes are self or custom built, in France and Germany it’s over 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand in the UK is now changing. The number of people now looking to build their own home, is at a record level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in a recent survey by the Building Societies Association 53% said they wanted to build their own home, and interestingly two thirds of the people who want to build their own home want to within the next 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this isn’t a pie in the sky dream, it’s a real ambition for many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the principle restraints to self build has always been finding a plot of land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities have responded to this challenge by using Community Land Trusts. Groups of people across the country are getting together to build on local plots - whether that’s in, Shropshire, Devon, Cumbria or right here in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our new &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/community-right-to-build" title="Community Right to Build"&gt;Community Right to Build&lt;/a&gt; scheme, which has just begun, will also make it even easier for larger custom-built projects. And planning authorities are now identifying land where self and custom-built home will be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a government, we are determined to make self and custom build housing a realistic option for many more people. Hence the change to the planning rules, and the creation of new vehicles to enable custom-built homes to progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to realise our ambition (to double the size of the sector over the next decade) we’re going to need fresh thinking from builders and designers, planners and yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some members have already responded - with self-build mortgage products up from 14 to 24 in the last year. Indeed some independent predictions are anticipating lending will rise by 140% in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m not pretending self build is the entire answer, but it’s a element I want to encourage you to incorporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’d like to encourage you to go even further, and fully consider the opportunities of this market for your business. Whether that’s by tailoring your lending products for builders and contractors (who are building custom homes) or extending products like build-out insurance, which can help reduce lending risks for your sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly endorse the principle of this conference - that all of us need, to think differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For too long we’ve had a dysfunctional housing market, with too few homes for a growing population. And, let’s be clear, finance has been part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with reforms now in place to help both the supply of homes, and to ensure that appropriate finance is available to those who are credit worthy, we need to work together, to help us return the market to a sustainable, healthy state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a government we are committed to these reforms and to working closely with builders and with lenders, so that we can ensure that many, many more people can finally get the home that they and their family need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Independent panel to help government cut housebuilding red tape and boost growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Don Foster today launched a new independent group of building industry experts, tasked with simplifying the mass of rules imposed on developers and housebuilders, to make them easier to understand and follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge,&lt;/a&gt; ministers have made clear they want to do everything possible to remove unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy imposed on developers to get much-needed new homes built, and support economic growth. The current, complex system of building regulations and housing standards will be targeted by a new Independent Challenge Panel, which will consider how these requirements work together and what potential there is to free up the system and make it work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel will for the first time bring independent experts together with government and it will report to ministers in spring 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mr Foster also made clear that essential safety and accessibility protections will remain untouched and that homes will always need to be built to high sustainability and quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="housing-standards-review"&gt;Housing standards review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the hundreds of standards that can be applied to new-build homes, some of which duplicate each other, a separate group will work alongside the new Challenge Panel to consider the specific issue of standards applied to housebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these standards are applied nationally across certain types of homes, such as affordable housing, others are made mandatory by individual councils for building in their area and some are entirely voluntary - resulting in confusion for local people and developers. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the requirement for 2 phone lines in home offices, irrespective of need and in addition to broadband connection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rules on window sizes that include a ‘dirty window factor’ - imposing bigger windows to allow for dirt on them, rather than assuming people will simply clean their windows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a requirement that ‘drying space’ is designed and assessed when often this is nothing more complicated than a washing line over a bath&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conflicting guidance on how to construct safe and accessible stairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;standards being assessed repeatedly by different people - such as planners, code assessors, building control officers - often looking at the same issues but coming up with different answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new review, led by the Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) and to be conducted by a group of industry representatives, will look to avoid overlap and duplication in the system, helping ensure builders meet the high standards that aspiring homeowners rightly expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don Foster said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The current array of different housing standards used in different parts the country is complex and counter-productive, confusing local residents, councillors and developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is why an urgent review has now started, bringing the government together with housebuilders, planners, councils and architects to establish what the unnecessary measures are that we can cut out of the system, while ensuring buildings are still made to exacting standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to see a simpler set of housing standards that people can easily understand and that free up developers and councils to get on with the job of building the high-quality new homes we so badly need to get more first-time buyers and families onto the housing ladder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review was part of the government’s housing and growth strategy announced on 6 September 2012. It will result in a clear plan of action by next spring that will be put out to consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Independent Challenge Panel members are:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andy Von Bradsky (architect)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;David Clements (building control)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Paul Watson (planner)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kirk Archibald (developer)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; is chairing and leading the housing standards review and has convened a group of members from representative industry bodies, comprising:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homes and Communities Agency&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;House Builders Association&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;National House Builders Council&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;National Housing Federation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Habinteg Housing Association&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Local Government Association&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Planning Officers Society&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Home Builders Federation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Construction Products Association&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Building Control Alliance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Association of Chief Police Officers&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;UKGBC&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Building Research Establishment&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Royal Institute for British Architects&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Building Regulations Advisory Council&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Greater London Authority&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the housing standards that the review will consider include the Code for Sustainable Homes, Secured by Design, Lifetime Homes, Standards and Quality in Development and the Homes and Communities Agency’s Housing Quality Indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The review is taking place alongside the review of planning practice guidance which was announced on 16 October 2012, and both groups will be working closely together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Red Tape Challenge was launched by the Prime Minister in April 2011 and is systematically examining some 6,500 substantive regulations that the government inherited with the aim of scrapping or significantly reducing as many of them as possible. It gives business and the public the chance to have their say, by theme, on the regulations that affect their everyday lives. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/housing-and-construction/"&gt;Housing and Construction Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; was open for comment from the 12 January until 17 February 2012. More information can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On 10 September 2012 the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced that through the Red Tape Challenge at least 3,000 of the cross-government regulations examined will be scrapped or reduced. By ‘scrapped’, we mean that regulation is completely removed from the statute book. By ‘reduced’, we mean that regulations are reduced in number (eg a consolidation, making the rules simpler to find and follow); and/or in terms of the burden they impose (eg reducing who is caught by the regulation; removing domestic gold-plating of EU law; active renegotiation of EU law; simplifying requirements set by the regulation or in related guidance; or reducing the burden of inspection and enforcement arising from the regulation). Around 1,500 of the 3,000 changes will have a measurable financial benefit for business: this does not include consolidations of regulations without any changes to the content of those regulations. The Red Tape Challenge comprises regulation of UK origin and regulation that transposes EU laws. It does not include legislation or regulations falling within the responsibilities of the devolved administrations, tax and fees legislation or national security matters.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Department statement on Dale Farm</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The public want to see fair play - with planning rules being upheld and action being taken against those who try to cheat the system.
&amp;gt; “The Government has already changed the law to tackle abuses of the planning system, and we propose to strengthen the law further to allow councils to stop unauthorised sites as soon as they happen, to prevent future drawn-out cases like Dale Farm.
&amp;gt; “We are also providing £60 million of funding to help support authorised pitches for travellers, supporting law-abiding citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/farmers-should-be-able-to-offer-affordable-homes-on-the-farm"/>
    <title> Farmers should be able to offer affordable homes on the farm</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councils should look to amend their existing planning policies to make it easier for disused farm buildings to be converted into affordable homes said Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average house price in rural England has more than doubled over the past decade to over £250,000, but the average salary is still £21,000. The numbers of people on social housing waiting lists in rural areas has risen to 750,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Mr Stunell has called on farmers to identify disused farm buildings that could be converted into new affordable homes for local people, and for councils to look favourably on their planning applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It fulfils a key Coalition Agreement commitment to enable the building of Homes on the Farm, by encouraging the redevelopment of disused agricultural buildings as new and affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Farmers are the custodians of our countryside, managing thousands of acres of rural land across England. But when they want to make disused buildings available for new homes, they can often face an uphill battle to get planning permission in the face of their council’s development plans.
&amp;gt; “As more young people are unable to afford to live in rural areas and village schools, shops and pubs struggle to survive, farmers are ideally placed to help bring the community together to help reverse this trend.
&amp;gt; “That’s why I want to make it easier for farmers to offer Homes on the Farm for local people. One small step for councils will offer a significant opportunity for communities to get the new and affordable homes their villages need. I want farmers to take their place at the forefront of this rural revolution alongside their local councils, to make farm buildings available, and to work with their local communities to shape the sustainable development of their countryside so it can remain a vibrant place to live for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Farmers Union planning adviser Ivan Moss said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Home on the Farm scheme is an excellent opportunity for farmers who want to use their outbuildings for a constructive purpose. It should also sustain the rural economy by providing homes for those working in it.
&amp;gt; “The NFU will watch with interest the outcomes of the first applications from farmers to their local councils to convert disused buildings into affordable homes and hope that councils will be equally eager to be pioneers in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Welcome support for park home residents</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government today welcomed a Parliamentary Bill that will seek to offer additional protections for residents of park homes against unscrupulous or dishonest operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Aldous’ &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/mobilehomes.html"&gt;Private Members’ Bill&lt;/a&gt; (external link) is fully supported by the Government, led by the Housing Minister Mark Prisk, and has its second reading debate in the House of Commons on Friday 19 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, many park home residents live in poor conditions and are unable to exercise their existing legal rights. The worst practices of dishonest site owners include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking the open market sales of park homes on their sites - without justifiable reason;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charging excessive pitch fees and breaching site rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These abuses have manifested in real-life examples where operators have lied to prospective purchasers about the conditions of homes and even dug holes around homes to make them unsaleable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms are designed to ensure site owners who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already while rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reforms to the licensing system that applies to park home sites;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;measures to prevent operators from blocking residents’ sales in the open market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening the existing law to protect occupiers from harassment and make it an offence to lie to prevent a home being sold;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a possible future ‘fit and proper’ registration to restrict the ability of unscrupulous operators from management of sites; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a scheme to make pitch fee reviews more transparent and new rules on reviews so they are fairer and reflect the condition of the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many people choose a park home expecting a peaceful retirement and a good quality of life. This bill will help to make that a reality by ensuring that sites are safe and properly managed and that residents are better able to exercise their rights.
&amp;gt; “This industry has been blighted by rogue operators - these reforms aim to drive them out of the industry securing a fairer deal both for home owners and for the good operators, running decent businesses.
&amp;gt; “This is why the Government is fully backing Peter Aldous’ Mobile Homes Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>First self-build projects to benefit from multi-million fund</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk today said he was delighted that the first applications for a slice of a new £30million self-build investment fund have been earmarked for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a special self-build workshop for local authority Leaders in London, Mr Prisk said that the first projects would benefit from over £1.1million to start work on up to 20 self-build plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following final checks and approvals, the applications in North East Derbyshire and Peterborough will be the first to receive the funding, which provides short-term finance to help unlock projects where groups of self-build homes are built at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister, along with self-build industry champion, architecture specialist and presenter of Channel 4’s Grand Designs Kevin McCloud, hosted the workshop for local authority Leaders in association with the Local Government Association, to discuss how they could support prospective self builders in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A specialist team from Almere in the Netherlands also attended to share their expertise. Almere, near Amsterdam, is the largest low-cost self-build experiment in Europe, which has grown rapidly in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year the former Housing Minister travelled to Almere with a delegation from the UK self-build industry, and hosted an event with Dutch Government officials and business leaders at the British Embassy to boost trade and links between Dutch and British businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said that there had been a great surge of interest in recent years for self-build, and it was now important that local authorities learnt from abroad and local projects to identify opportunities for self-build development in their plans, and to give people in their area the opportunity to build their own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Across the country, more people than ever want control over the design and build of their home. But these types of projects have often been held back because of limited land availability, reluctance by lenders to provide finance and red tape. So I’m delighted that the first self-build projects in Derbyshire and Peterborough have been earmarked for Government cash.
&amp;gt; “This money will be repaid as plots are sold, and I hope it will demonstrate to lenders, investors and the development industry that these types of projects are worth backing. But it’s not just about money, self builders and developers need the support of local authorities to get these projects off the ground. So I’m pleased we have the team from Almere to share their expertise, and I urge local authorities to learn from their example and help more self builders achieve their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin McCloud said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to attend this event today with the new Housing Minister and welcome the first approvals for cash from the Government’s £30million investment fund which will help drive activity in the sector and give more people the opportunity to build their own home. But it is not just about cash, we need to see more support from local authorities if we’re serious about making self build a mainstream housing option. And I hope we can draw inspiration from the projects like Almere, and many others across Europe, about what is achievable with strong local leadership and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approval for the first custom build homes funding application with a value of £450,000 has been given to a developer in North East Derbyshire on a site at Morton for nine self-build plots. A second application for 11 self-build plots with a loan value of approximately £725,000 for a site in Peterborough has also been approved. Both approvals are subject to final due diligence and contract.  Details will be available once final due diligence checks have been finalised and contracts agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A further application for funding has been received for a multi-unit self build development on a site in Derbyshire and the Homes and Communities Agency is in discussion with several other project promoters who are seeking to apply for funding with more applications expected before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details of the funding Custom Build Homes fund can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/custom-build"&gt;www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/custom-build&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The £30million fund will be available over the next three years (2012 to 2015). Funding is available to cover the cost of building, land acquisition or other costs associated with a proposed development of five or more custom build homes with planning permission. The funding is available to eligible applicants bringing forward projects in England with the exception of London.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate funding arrangements are available for London. Further details fund can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/housing/homes-and-communities/build-your-own-home"&gt;www.london.gov.uk/priorities/housing/homes-and-communities/build-your-own-home&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laying the Foundations: A Housing Strategy for England&lt;/em&gt; sets out the Government’s plans to support social mobility and get the housing market - and in particular new house building - moving again, including a Custom Build Homes programme to support and encourage more individuals and communities to build their own homes. The Housing Strategy can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Multi-million pound boost will help buyers onto the housing ladder</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time buyers will from today benefit from a multi-million pound boost to help them onto the housing ladder said Housing Minister Mark Prisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister announced the first allocations from a £280million pot to help a further 16,500 first time buyers benefit from the FirstBuy scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk confirmed that £40million will go to 41 developers to help 2,500 first-time buyers this year - and called on them to go further, and bid for a share of £240million to help deliver thousands more new homes under the scheme next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="home-ownership-hope-for-thousands"&gt;Home ownership hope for thousands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hugely popular FirstBuy scheme reduces the amount of deposit first-time buyers have to find by offering an equity loan of up to 20 per cent provided by the Government and developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister said that the extension of FirstBuy would provide help to thousands more first time buyers across the country, offering an alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme has already helped thousands of buyers across the country, with 3,000 sales made by March this year and developers reporting more than 8,000 FirstBuy reservations by the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £280million boost to FirstBuy forms part of the Housing and Growth Package announced by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in September, one of a range of measures designed to get Britain building and kickstart the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This package builds on the suite of options available for aspiring homeowners who want to get onto and up the housing ladder. This includes the NewBuy Guarantee and the reinvigorated Right to Buy, which will give thousands of council tenants the opportunity to buy their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Firstbuy has already proved hugely successful, providing a practical alternative to the Bank of Mum and Dad for thousands of first-time buyers across the country.
&amp;gt; “The scheme has become a major player in helping people onto the property ladder and getting Britain building again - and I’m determined to maintain that momentum.
&amp;gt; “That’s why today just a month after the Prime Minister confirmed this funding boost, I’m asking developers to start putting this money to good use - and giving them the chance to start planning for how they can help first-time buyers in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homes and Communities Agency chief executive Pat Ritchie said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We welcome the additional £280million of FirstBuy funding, which will make a major difference to the lives of prospective homebuyers and keep momentum for affordable home ownership going, not only for this financial year but for the year after.
&amp;gt; “We are pleased to be able to allocate some of the funding for this financial year, and anticipate a strong bid response to the remaining £240million, and we look forward to working with our developer partners to bring these homes forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FirstBuy provides first time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20 per cent of a new build property from a participating developer. The loan, which is jointly funded by Government and housebuilder, can reduce the deposit requirement to just 5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Budget 2011 the Chancellor announced the FirstBuy scheme which will see Government and housebuilders providing £400million to help around 10,500 first time buyers purchase a home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Homes and Communities Agency published official statistics on 12 June that showed there had been 2,994 sales by the end of March 2012 (sales starting in September 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 6 September the Prime Minister announced a further £280million for the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Homes and Communities Agency has today announced initial allocations of £40million and published a prospectus inviting housebuilders to submit proposals for the remaining £240million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Councils seeing benefits of reducing numbers of empty homes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing thousands of empty homes back into use has unlocked over £63million additional funding that is directly benefiting local communities through the successful New Homes Bonus scheme, Communities Minister Don Foster revealed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a further move towards greater Government transparency, the figures showed which councils have made the biggest reduction in empty homes and the New Homes Bonus that they will have received for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, local authorities have brought nearly 38,000 long-term empty homes back into use over the past two years - helping to tackle the housing shortage and providing a roof over the heads of hard working families across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top five local authorities that have seen the biggest reduction in empty homes are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birmingham, which has brought 2,151 empty homes back into use, along with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manchester, 2,118 homes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bradford, 1,944 homes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liverpool, 1,855 homes, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salford, 1,582 homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the release of the figures, Don Foster said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This information, shown in this way for the first time, lets people see how their councils are embracing the New Homes Bonus by examining their empty housing stock and turning it back into use.
&amp;gt; “I’m delighted we’ve had such a positive start and encourage all councils to work hard in transforming empty properties, which drag down neighbourhoods, and instead turn them into homes fit for families.
&amp;gt; “By making councils accountable to their residents, not to Whitehall, we are ensuring local tax-payers have the ability to check that money is being spent efficiently and decisions taken for the benefit of the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s powerful and innovative New Homes Bonus scheme rewards councils who increase their housing stock, either by building new homes or converting empty properties back into use, by match funding the additional council tax raised, with an additional amount for affordable homes, for the following six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has meant that communities are seeing the benefits of growth for the first time - in stark contrast to the previous, top-down system of regional housing targets which Ministers argue pitted neighbourhoods against developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h3&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk responds to an article in The Daily Mirror that claims 8000 elderly people have been denied the Disabled Facilities Grant due to local authority funding cuts, forcing many into care homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Government has increased funding for the Disabled Facilities Grant. In 2011-12 the national allocation to local authorities was £200 million compared to £156.9 million under the last administration. This central support will total £745 million over the Spending Review period.
&amp;gt; “Despite the need to tackle the deficit we have inherited from the last Administration, we are also investing £6.5 billion in Supporting People services, providing £51 million for handyperson services and supporting Home Improvement Agencies to provide a range of services to a quarter of a million elderly and disabled households every year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eric Pickles sees Gurkhas settling into Rushmoor</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles saw first-hand the positive effect of Government funding in helping Nepalese Gurkhas and their families settle in the country on a visit to Aldershot today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles met council officials, Citizens Advice Bureau staff and local Nepali community leaders and discovered how Rushmoor Borough Council are spending £500,000 that he had given to help with integration of former soldiers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2216606.jpg" alt="Eric Pickles meets Gurkhas at Rushmoor"&gt;Eric Pickles meeting Gurkhas and their families&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding has helped ease the exceptional pressures on Rushmoor, which has seen a large number of Gurkha ex-servicemen and their dependents arrive in the towns of Aldershot and Farnborough over a relatively short period of time. The recent arrivals include a high proportion of children and elderly Nepalese nationals which has placed a recognised strain on local social, health and education services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These brave British army veterans have given our country loyal service over many years. It is their bravery that has helped protect our way of life and our traditions and it is right that their dedication is honoured.
&amp;gt; “Many of these ex-servicemen and their families have been proud to call this country their home and we too are proud of the strong ties that have been established between the ex-Gurkhas, their families and their wider communities. We are determined that if they chose to settle in the UK to see that they and their families are treated with dignity and respect and are made to feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles also used the visit to announce the final instalment of the funding, a £150,000 payment towards English language training which is seen as a vital element in helping the Nepali people settle and contribute to their local community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government and the Deputy Prime Minister announced a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2030149"&gt;£1.5million fund for the Gurkha community&lt;/a&gt; in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Housing and growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on housing and planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the coalition government inherited a legacy where house building had fallen to its lowest rates since the 1920s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a top-down planning system that built nothing but resentment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a regime of regional planning quangos that created paralysis and confrontation -  after 6 years of preparation, by the general election, less than 60 councils had completed local plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was no development. No regeneration. No community benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government wants to get the economy growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove unnecessary red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support locally led sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, the government published a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/laying-the-foundations-a-housing-strategy-for-england--2" title="Laying the foundations: a housing strategy for England"&gt;housing strategy&lt;/a&gt; to support a thriving, active and stable housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, we published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; to condense 1,000 pages of central planning guidance to just 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housebuilding is up: 29% higher in 2011 than in 2009. But there is more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, my department is announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building and support locally-led economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical details are laid out in a written statement which has been laid before the House. I will summarise the key points for Hon Members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;following on from &lt;a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11300/2204242.pdf" title="Review of the barriers to institutional investment in private rented homes"&gt;Sir Adrian Montague’s independent report (PDF 272 KB)&lt;/a&gt; on supporting the private rented sector, we are providing £200 million of new funding to support institutional investment in high-quality rented homes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to the action we have taken to tackle the last government’s deficit, we are passing on the lower costs of borrowing. We will be issuing a debt guarantee for up to £10 billion to support private investment in the private rented sector and in new affordable housing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we will support up to an additional 15,000 affordable homes through the use of loan guarantees, flexibilities and capital funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we also intend to extend our successful refurbishment programme to bring an additional 5,000 existing empty homes back into use. The last government wanted to demolish Victorian terraces with John Prescott’s Pathfinder programme. By contrast, we are getting homes back into productive use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in total we will invest another £300 million in these measures to support new affordable homes and bring empty homes into use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we actively want to support home ownership, which fell under the last Parliament despite a Labour pledge to increase it by a million&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are extending our successful FirstBuy scheme for first time buyers, with an additional £280 million of funding, helping up to 16,500 additional first-time buyers to purchase a home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to free up more brownfield land for development and regeneration, we will accelerate the release of surplus public sector land and empty offices through a targeted programme of transfers from other government bodies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we will work with local authorities and developers to unlock locally supported large sites. Just last week, we were back to unblock the Eastern Quarry in the Ebbsfleet Valley - a major ex-industrial site that had stalled for a decade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working with local communities and councils. But some councils need to raise their game, by failing to make planning decisions in a timely way. Planning delays create uncertainty both for local residents and local firms. So we will introduce a series of practical measures to help speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some complex developments take time to assemble. So we are allowing for developers to extend the duration of existing planning permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are making it easier for developers to change unrealistic Section 106 agreements. A development which isn’t built means no Section 106 payments. Common sense reforms will result in more regeneration, more housing and more community benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable development should go hand in hand with environmental safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm that we have protected the Green Belt, in line with our commitment in the coalition agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always the case that councils can amend local Green Belt boundaries should they wish - and we will support councils which choose to. This can include introducing new Green Belt protection around new large developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable previously developed land in many Green Belt areas. We encourage councils to make best use of this land, whilst protecting the openness of the Green Belt in line with the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are to protect our countryside, we need to focus more growth in our town centres. So we are introducing measures to make it easier to turn empty commercial buildings into housing. Our high streets will benefit from a greater resident population, increasing footfall and supporting local shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nation, we have great pride in our homes. We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements - such as building a new conservatory. So we will be seeking to simplify and increase permitted development rights for householders. Cutting back municipal red tape in this way could provide a particular boost for small traders and small builders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, these practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving more power to individuals, to communities, to councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing new incentives to support local shops, local firms and local economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend this statement to the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Plan to boost British housebuilding, jobs and the economy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, alongside the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, set out a major housing and planning package that will help deliver:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;up to 70,000 new homes, including affordable housing and opportunities for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;140,000 jobs and a boost to the construction sector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£40 billion guarantee for major infrastructure projects and £10 billion for new homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes a series of measures aimed at supporting businesses, developers and first-time buyers, while slashing unnecessary red tape across the planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing restrictions on house builders to help unlock 75,000 homes currently stalled due to sites being commercially unviable. Developers who can prove that council’s costly affordable housing requirements make the project unviable will see them removed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New legislation for Government guarantees of up to £40 billion worth of major infrastructure projects and up to £10 billion of new homes. The Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Bill will include guaranteeing the debt of Housing Associations and private sector developers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up to 15,000 affordable homes and bring 5,000 empty homes back into use using new capital funding of £300m and the infrastructure guarantee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An additional 5,000 homes built for rent at market rates in line with proposals outlined in Sir Adrian Montague’s report to Government on boosting the private rented sector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thousands of big commercial and residential applications to be directed to a major infrastructure fast track and where councils are poor at processing decisions developers can opt to have their decision taken by the Planning Inspectorate. More applications also will go into a fast track appeal process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;16,500 first-time buyers helped with a £280m extension of the successful ‘FirstBuy’ scheme, which offers aspiring homeowners a much-needed deposit and a crucial first step on the housing ladder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a time limited period, slashing planning red tape, including sweeping away the rules and bureaucracy that prevent families and businesses from making improvements to their properties, helping tens of thousands of home owners and companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The measures announced today show this Government is serious about rolling its sleeves up and doing it all it can to kick-start the economy. Some of the proposals are controversial; others have been a long time in coming. But along with our Housing Strategy, they provide a comprehensive plan to unleash one of the biggest homebuilding programmes this country has seen in a generation. That means more investment around the county; more jobs for our people; and more young families able to realise their dreams and get on the housing ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deputy Prime Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a Coalition Government, determined to get on with the job of delivering a healthier economy.Today’s major boost to housing and planning will make it easier to build a home, easier to buy a first home and easier to extend a home. A boost that will get Britain building again. Building thousands of affordable homes and generating thousands of new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Government wants to get the economy growing. To remove unnecessary red tape. To support locally-led sustainable development.
&amp;gt; “Today we are announcing a further series of common sense measures to promote house building, speed up planning decisions and appeals, and major infrastructure.
&amp;gt; “These practical measures build on the housing, local government finance and planning reforms already in play. Delivering sustainable development and getting Britain building.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Safety net against homelessness continues to 2015</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support secured for those facing homelessness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding to help those facing the real and frightening prospect of homelessness will continue to the end of this Parliament, Housing Minister Grant Shapps said today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2208882.jpg" alt="StreetLink poster"&gt;A preview of the new StreetLink poster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils across the country are set to receive a share of £160million over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister also confirmed that a new website and telephone line, where anyone anywhere looking to get help for someone sleeping on the streets can go to, is on track to be available by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also offered a first-look at a new campaign aimed at encouraging people to seek help for rough sleepers in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="funding-support"&gt;Funding support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps announced that councils across the country would receive £160million over the next two years in Homelessness Prevention Grants - offering certainty that homelessness services will be funded to the end of this Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is on top of the £160million that has been allocated to councils over this and last year, which has been used to offer support to those facing the threat of homelessness, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing rent deposit schemes to enable homeless people to get accommodation in the private rented sector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mediation services to help prevent relationship breakdown leading to homelessness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;outreach services to help get rough sleepers off the streets and into accommodation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latest figures show that 199,000 households were last year given help to stay in their homes or find new places to live - stopping them from facing losing their home and, potentially, a life on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="streetlink-support"&gt;StreetLink support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Mr Shapps also confirmed that plans for a new website and national phone line are on track to be available by Christmas, so that anyone will be able to ring if they are looking for help for someone sleeping rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StreetLink, to be run by charities Homeless Link and Broadway, will include a national telephone line, and website accessible via smart phone, so anyone anywhere can provide details of someone sleeping rough in their neighbourhood so they can be found and connected to local services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of posters will be released in December alongside these new tools, so residents, charities and councils can all work together to ensure as few people as possible face spending this Christmas on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister released the first images from a campaign due to start in the run-up to Christmas to encourage members of the public to come forward and seek help for local rough sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All too often, we see people sleeping rough on our streets and don’t know what to do for the best, where to turn to get them help and whether offering a handout really does offer them help out of homelessness.
&amp;gt; “That’s why I’m delighted that this December, StreetLink will offer a solution, with members of the public able to ring a national helpline or use a website accessible by smart phone to help ensure someone sleeping rough can be found and connected to local services.
&amp;gt; “And to ensure that we shore up the strongest safety net in the world, I can today confirm £160m funding right up to the end of this Parliament, giving councils the means to continue their strong work in preventing homelessness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has approved a new measure that will increase the number of homes in town centres and help increase footfall on high streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New planning rights will allow more flats to be created above shops without the need for planning permission. Two flats will be allowed to be created in office or storage space under new permitted development rights coming into force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change further streamlines the planning system, making it easier, quicker and cheaper for people to create new homes in existing underused space. It has the potential to help increase the amount of affordable housing and ensures better use is made of existing developed land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relaxing planning restrictions on creating flats above shops can also help increase the vitality of town centres by increasing footfall and providing a boost to high street regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are common sense planning reforms that will deliver more affordable homes in areas where there are good transport links whilst ensuring better use of existing developed land.
&amp;gt; “Cutting this red tape should be a shot in the arm for the high street increasing footfall and providing a boost to regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning Minister Greg Clark Mr Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government is determined to make the very best use of existing buildings to provide more homes as quickly and simply as possible. This change offers real potential to provide more affordable housing and give a much needed boost to our high streets.
&amp;gt; “Ensuring unused space above shops can be used in a better way is one of the many changes the Government has introduced to streamline the planning system and to cut unnecessary bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also announced proposed measures to simplify the planning system further by making it easier to temporarily re-use some buildings without needing planning permission, streamlining the paper work needed for planning applications and speeding up planning appeal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has also outlined a package of measures to help high streets reclaim their role at the heart of our communities. These include encouraging town centres to become Town Team partners to benefit from the support and advice available from the Government and leading retail experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change in permitted development rights applies to A1 (retail units) and A2 (financial/professional services units) commercial properties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current legislation only allows for one flat to be created above a shop without the need for a planning application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new permitted development rights will come into force on 1 October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Major clampdown launched on 'beds in sheds'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action to tackle suburban shanty towns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers today launched a major clampdown on rogue landlords to bring an end to suburban shanty towns that trap vulnerable people in dangerous living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2208223.jpg" alt="Beds in sheds"&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Immigration Minister Damian Green outside a shed being rented out illegally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Immigration Minister Damian Green launched new guidance to councils making clear the wide range of powers at their disposal to shut down so-called ‘beds in sheds’ that blight entire neighbourhoods and take action against other bad practice by landlords such as overcrowding and poor maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps and Mr Green saw the evidence for themselves when they attended an early morning visit on a suspected rogue landlord’s properties, and witnessed the squalid conditions the ‘tenants’ paid hundreds of pounds a week to live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While visiting six properties, officials from Ealing Council and the UK Border Agency encountered 39 individual tenants, 22 of whom were illegal immigrants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;of those 22 illegal immigrants encountered, &lt;strong&gt;19 were detained&lt;/strong&gt; (three were required to report to a Reporting Centre because they were a couple with a young child);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of those 22 encountered, &lt;strong&gt;14 were found in the outhouses&lt;/strong&gt; (this includes the two adults with the young child). The remainder were found in the houses;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of those 19 detainees, 16 were Indian nationals and three were Pakistani nationals;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of those 19 detainees, nine entered the country without leave, eight were overstayers, one was a failed asylum seeker and one was working in breach of his visa conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="power-to-tackle-rogue-landlords"&gt;Power to tackle rogue landlords&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidance highlights the range of actions councils can take to clamp down on rogue landlords once and for all. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proactively identifying problem properties and effectively working through complaints;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taking action using a full range of legal powers to stop rogue landlord activities;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with other organisations including the police and UK Border Agency to tackle linked criminal behaviour;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prosecuting landlords who persistently let illegal property;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing evidence of landlord’s earnings to magistrates to ensure they receive an appropriate level of fine for offences;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;naming and shaming prosecuted landlords by publicising successful cases;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with the new national taskforce which has been set up between Whitehall departments, the police, the UK Border Agency and local government. The taskforce is exploring all possible options for closing down ‘beds in sheds’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of sheds and outbuildings are being rented out illegally to vulnerable migrants by ruthless landlords who charge them extortionate rents to live in cramped conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ‘tenants’ can often find it difficult to return home quickly with some having destroyed their passports to avoid removal often leaving them to either live in these outbuildings or face living on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s simply unacceptable that people are living in squalid, unsafe accommodation provided by landlords more interested in a quick profit rather then their basic responsibilities.
&amp;gt; “The actions of these rogue landlords are helping fuel illegal working and benefit fraud and creates a shadow housing market that carries dangers to peoples health as well as community relations.
&amp;gt; “I want to see all agencies from councils to the police and the UK Border Agency using the full range of powers at their disposal to work together on a national clampdown towards ridding our communities of this problem once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration Minister Damian Green said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Operations like this show our determination to do whatever is necessary, working alongside local authorities and police, to enforce our laws against those who are in the UK illegally.
&amp;gt; “The UK Border Agency continues to gather intelligence about those illegally in the country. Those with no right to be in the UK must leave the country. If they need help to leave the country voluntarily we will offer it but if they refuse we will enforce there removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s guidance is backed up by the recent allocation of £1.8million to councils earlier this year to tackle the issue and flush out those landlords renting out ‘beds in sheds’.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Plans for thousands of homes unlocked by historic deal</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New agreement will get work started on thousands of new properties&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans for thousands of new homes that have been stuck on the drawing board for a decade are to finally get the go-ahead thanks to an historic deal reached between ministers, councillors and developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal will unlock around 22,600 much-needed homes over the next 20 years - delivering as many as 60,000 jobs - and brings a brownfield site back into use. The first phase at Eastern Quarry, Ebbsfleet, in Kent will deliver 1,500 homes as part of wider plans for Kent Thameside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers Land Securities have invested over £100million in developing the site. However, plans have been delayed amid concerns over the cost and the need for further investment in transport improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, after work by Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Transport Minister Mike Penning with Kent councils and the developers, builders could be on site as early as next Summer with the first homes set to be completed by December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="historic-deal-reached"&gt;Historic deal reached&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kent County Council and Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils worked closely with the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency to reduce costs of the transport programme and to agree how funding could be unlocked. Under the arrangements agreed, the Department for Transport and Highways Agency will begin development work on two major junction improvements and will work with Kent County Council and the Kent Thameside partners in managing the transport investment programme necessary to deliver the new developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils will ensure that contributions from Land Securities and other sites are provided to support the transport improvement programme, and that they and Kent County Council use a proportion of their New Homes Bonus payments to contribute to the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal reached between these three councils and Land Securities on the specific planning obligations - known as a Section 106 agreement - will enable work to start. Land Securities will contribute nearly £25million towards the Homes and Roads Programme, through to completion of 4,500 homes on the site by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps said that this illustrated the benefits of Government, local authorities and developers working together to unlock progress on stalled larger sites and signalled that he was keen to build on this approach in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s frustrating that while the need for homes in Kent and the surrounding area has continued to grow, the Kent Thameside development - offering the opportunity for tens of thousands of new homes - has been stuck on the drawing board for a whole decade.
&amp;gt; “So I’m delighted that we’re finally taking steps forward to get builders on site and work finally started. This historic deal offers a double benefit to the local area, a commitment to improve the road network but also to deliver over 22,600 properties over the next 20 years - with the first homes set to be completed in little over a year from now.
&amp;gt; “After such a delay, like local residents I look forward to seeing the properties being built, the jobs being created and, in the near future, the first families moving into their new homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Mike Penning said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government has been clear about the need to maintain a pipeline of future transport infrastructure improvements given their importance in delivering economic growth.
&amp;gt; “By agreeing to carry out the necessary preparatory work for potential future junction improvements on the A2, we have been able to show our commitment and give the confidence needed by private sector developers to allow them to begin the delivery of the ambitious new housing programme in Kent Thameside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Carter, Leader of Kent County Council said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Getting this significant development underway and built out signals our continued intent to increase construction activity in Kent. We have real growth ambitions and this site signifies our intent to unlock the potential of the Thames Gateway. Where sites are stalled we will talk to developers about ways of releasing sites in the short term. However we will only work with those that are intent on accelerating development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillor Jeremy Kite, Leader of Dartford Borough Council said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It has been a long road but this finally seems to be our opportunity to build a great community and top quality housing for a new generation of Dartford families. Housing for sons and daughters of local people is a real responsibility and Eastern Quarry provides a great setting for young people to build their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colette O’Shea, Head of London Development, Land Securities said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are pleased that a way forward has been found to unlock the potential at Eastern Quarry and we will now sit down with our housebuilding partners and press ahead to start delivering homes and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first phase of 1,500 homes at Eastern Quarry are expected to be completed by 2020, with a further 3,000 homes expected to be completed by 2030-31. Eastern Quarry forms part of longer term plans which are expected to unlock the development of 22,600 homes and around 1million m2 of commercial development across the Kent Thameside region over the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Homes and Communities Agency has already invested £13million in the supporting transport investment (the Homes and Roads Programme), and is committed to working with all parties to identify other future funding sources as work progresses on the development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kent Thameside Strategic Transport (Homes and Roads) Programme is a £116million investment in transport improvements covering both the Strategic and Local Road Network aim at enabling the planned level of development to be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Homes and Roads Programme is a package of the following seven schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A2 Ebbsfleet Junction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A2 Bean Junction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A226 London Road/St Clements Way Junction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dartford Town Centre Improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rathmore Road Link, Gravesend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A226 Thames Way Dualling, Ebbsfleet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Urban Traffic Management and Control Measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key partners involved in the development, management and delivery of the Homes and Roads Programme include:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dartford Borough Council&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department for Transport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gravesham Borough Council&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highways Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homes and Communities Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kent County Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land Securities is the UK’s largest commercial property company and a member of the FTSE 100. The company owns and manages more than 29 million sq ft of property, from shopping centres to offices.

    <title>Sir Terence Conran joins drive to build higher quality homes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housebuilders challenged to prove the quality of new-build homes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star of the British design industry Sir Terence Conran is to work with the Government to help create a new competition to give communities a chance to design their own neighbourhoods, Housing Minister Grant Shapps announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes as Sir Terence and the Minister call on housebuilders to involve local people as early as possible in the design of new homes - helping to encourage communities to say yes to new housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition will be launched at a forthcoming summit this Autumn with communities invited to submit their designs for Sir Terence and other design industry stalwarts to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes as Mr Shapps lays down the gauntlet to developers to tackle the mistaken belief among too many people that new-build properties are potential ‘homes from hell’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="designing-with-local-needs-in-mind"&gt;Designing with local needs in mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the forthcoming summit, Sir Terence and Grant Shapps will urge developers to get the public involved in their design process from the very start - ensuring the homes they want and need are built in their area, meeting local demand and making them easier to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mr Shapps will argue there is another benefit to community involvement - proving to sceptics that new-build properties are well-built and of good quality design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister will say that all too often, tales of badly designed ‘homes from hell’ give new developments a bad reputation before they even get off the ground - when in fact many new build homes are at the height of modern design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polls have shown that a significant number of prospective buyers believe that new-builds are badly designed and built. And three-quarters of people would embrace more housing in their area if they knew it was better designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps will say it is unfair to tar all newly built homes with the same brush, and will call on developers to “prove the pessimists wrong” by taking more responsibility to get local communities back on side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m delighted that Sir Terence Conran, a leading light of the design industry, is helping us launch this competition, which will harness the creativity of communities up and down the country as they consider how they want their local areas to look.
&amp;gt; “But this is part of a wider point about the need to build more homes, which can’t happen without getting local people onside and turning NIMBYs into YIMBYs (Yes in My Back Yard). To do this, residents must be involved in the design of new developments from the outset - helping to build the homes communities want and need and meeting demand from local buyers.
&amp;gt; “And by doing this, housebuilders can finally tackle the belief that new-builds are potential ‘homes from hell’, proving the pessimists wrong and clearly demonstrating how well-designed and built their properties really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Terence Conran said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The design of an area has a significant and lasting impact on the quality of life of its residents - it’s therefore vital that local people have a say over how their communities look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want the competition to inspire communities up and down the country to really think about the places in which they want to live, what they want to see and how they can make a difference. I look forward to launching it later this year, and seeing how creative Britain can be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is putting the framework in place for developers to engage their neighbours early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New &lt;strong&gt;local plans&lt;/strong&gt;, introduced in planning reforms, encourage people’s active involvement in neighbourhood planning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new &lt;strong&gt;Community Right to Build&lt;/strong&gt; allows communities to approve local developments without the need for the normal planning process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy&lt;/strong&gt; raises funds from new developments to build the public infrastructure the neighbourhood wants, like park improvements or a new health centre.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;New Homes Bonus&lt;/strong&gt; lets communities see the benefits of local growth by rewarding new developments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details of the Home Builders Federation Customer Satisfaction Survey can be found at: [www.hbf.co.uk/fileadmin/documents/Customer_Satisfaction/Cust_Satisfaction&lt;em&gt;2012.pdf](http://www.hbf.co.uk/fileadmin/documents/Customer_Satisfaction/Cust_Satisfaction&lt;/em&gt;2012.pdf)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2010 Public Attitudes Survey by the former National Housing And Planning Advisory Unit (NHPAU) said found that just under three out of four (73 per cent) said they would support more homes if they were well designed and in keeping with the local area. Further details can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/507390/nhpau/pdf/16127041.pdf"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/documents/507390/nhpau/pdf/16127041.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. And the 2011 YouGov poll showed that 31 per cent of people would not consider buying a home built in the last 10 years, or would only consider it as a last resort. Of these, 60 per cent said it was because the rooms are too small, 46 per cent said they lack style, and 45 per cent were concerned about the lack of outside space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
