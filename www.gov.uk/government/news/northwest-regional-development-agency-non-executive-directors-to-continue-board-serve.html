<p>Cllr Anthony McDermot MBE, Cllr Susan Williams, Prof. John Brooks, Peter Allen MBE, Joe Dwek CBE and Cllr John Merry CBE will serve from the 14 December 2010 until the RDA closes.  The Minister also announced continued terms from July 2011 until NWDAs closure to Peter Hensman.</p>

<p>Mark Prisk said:</p>

<hr>
<p>“As we move toward a new framework for our regional economies, it is important that the development agencies are equipped with the leadership to ensure the transition period is a smooth one. </p>

<p>“The skills and experience of these board members will be a valuable asset during this time and I hope they will continue to work with us to ensure an efficient evolutionary process.”</p>

<p>Robert Hough, NWDA Chairman, said:</p>

<p>“The extensive knowledge and experience of the NWDA Board has been invaluable throughout the economic downturn, so I’m very pleased to welcome these reappointments. </p>

<p>“Our Board members’ understanding of the Northwest economy will be hugely beneficial in continuing to support economic recovery and help to assist Government’s objectives for the future of economic development.”</p>

<p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Regional Development Agency non-executive Board member posts </li>
</ol>
<p>attract a remuneration of £8,666 per year for a minimum time commitment of two days per month.</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>The continued terms for Cllr Anthony McDermott, Cllr Susan Williams, Prof. John Brooks, Peter Allen, Joe Dwek, Cllr John Merry and Peter Hensman are up until the RDA closes.   Final closure of RDAs is likely to be completed by 31 March 2012 following legislation.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RDAs are business-led organisations, promoting and co-ordinating </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>economic growth and development, enterprise and regeneration. </p>

<ol>
<li>The Coalition Government has made the decision to support the </li>
</ol>
<p>creation of local enterprise partnerships to replace RDAs.  On that basis the decision was made not to continue with further Board member recruitment.  The continued terms of Board members are necessary to ensure that the RDA Chairs are able effectively to manage their Board membership up until closure, and that membership does not fall below the minimum requirement of eight, as stated in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. </p>

<ol>
<li>The original appointments were made following open competition in    </li>
</ol>
<p>accordance with the requirement set down in the Commissioner for Public Appointments Code of Practice.  All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process.  However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public.</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>Prof John Brooks and Peter Allen have not declared any political activity in the past five years. Anthony McDermott is a Labour Councillor for Halton Borough Council, Susan Williams is a Conservative Councillor and stood as a Parliamentary candidate in 2010 for Bolton West.  John Merry is a Labour Councillor and Leader of Salford’s ruling Group. Joe Dwek has made a recordable donation to a political party and has undertaken activity for both the Labour and Conservative party. Peter Hensman is involved in the Conservative party and is Treasurer for his local Branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Peter Allen is a Board member of Natural England which attracts a remuneration of £10-15k for a time commitment of 4 days a month.  John Merry is on the Board of the Young Peoples Learning Agency which attracts a remuneration of £4k.   Prof John Brooks, Susan Williams, Cllr Anthony McDermott, Joe Dwek and Peter Hensman do not hold any further non-executive ministerial public appointments.</p>
