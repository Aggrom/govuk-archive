<p>A panel of 6 experts will take forward vital work to examine how the UK’s status as a leading global aviation hub can be maintained, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today. </p>

<p>The Secretary of State announced on 7 September that the Airports Commission would be chaired by Sir Howard Davies. Today the terms of reference for the Commission were announced alongside the appointment of the group of leading academics and aviation experts who will help Sir Howard.  </p>

<p>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aviation is vital to the UK economy and we need to have a long term aviation policy which meets the challenges of the future. Sir Howard and his team will now take forward this vitally important work for the Government and bring a much-needed fresh perspective to the debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir Howard Davies, Airports Commission chairman, said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am announcing a team with the range of skills and experience required to drive forward the important work the Commission is undertaking.</p>

  <p>With open minds, we will take time to explore the evidence, consider the options and aim to develop a lasting solution to the nation’s aviation needs.   Our ambition is to do a thorough piece of work that will ensure aviation continues to support this country’s economic, social and environmental ambitions.
The experience of recent years shows we need a robust evidence base which has the support of a broad consensus of opinion. We aim to put the next government into a position in which rapid and implementable decisions can be soundly made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Commissioners who will support Sir Howard Davies are:</p>

<p>Sir John Armitt CBE, the former Chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority and former Chief Executive of Network Rail. </p>

<p>Professor Ricky Burdett, Professor of Urban Studies at the London School of Economics and director of the LSE Cities research centre. </p>

<p>Vivienne Cox, the former CEO and Executive Vice President of BP Alternative Energy and a former member of the BP Executive Management Team. </p>

<p>Professor Dame Julia King, Vice Chancellor of Aston University and a member of the Committee on Climate Change, with a background in the aerospace industry. </p>

<p>Geoff Muirhead CBE, the former CEO of the Manchester Airport Group.</p>

<h2 id="notes-to-editors">Notes to editors</h2>

<h3 id="commissions-terms-of-reference">Commission’s terms of reference</h3>

<p>The Commission’s terms of reference are:</p>

<p>The Commission will examine the scale and timing of any requirement for additional capacity to maintain the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation hub; and it will identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term. </p>

<p>It should maintain a UK-wide perspective, taking appropriate account of the national, regional and local implications of any proposals.</p>

<p>It should engage openly with interested parties and members of the public, providing opportunities to submit evidence and proposals and to set out views relevant to its work.</p>

<p>It should seek to engage with a range of stakeholders, including with local and devolved government as well as the Opposition, to build consensus in support of its approach and recommendations. </p>

<p>The Commission should report no later than the end of 2013 on: </p>

<ul>
<li>its assessment of the evidence on the nature, scale and timing of the steps needed to maintain the UK’s global hub status; and</li>
  <li>its recommendation(s) for immediate actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next five years – consistent with credible long term options;</li>
</ul>
<p>The assessments and recommendations in the Commission’s interim report should be underpinned by a detailed review of the evidence in relation to the current position in the UK with regard to aviation demand and connectivity, forecasts for how these are likely to develop, and the expected future pattern of the UK’s requirements for international and domestic connectivity.</p>

<p>Its assessments of potential immediate actions should take into account their economic, social and environmental costs and benefits, and their operational deliverability. It should also be informed by an initial high-level assessment of the credible long-term options which merit further detailed development.</p>

<p>The Commission should report no later than summer 2015 on:</p>

<ul>
<li>its assessment of the options for meeting the UK’s international connectivity needs, including their economic, social and environmental impact;</li>
  <li>its recommendation(s) for the optimum approach to meeting any needs; and</li>
  <li>its recommendation(s) for ensuring that the need is met as expeditiously as practicable within the required timescale.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Commission should base the recommendations in its final report on a detailed consideration of the case for each of the credible options. This should include the development or examination of detailed business cases and environmental assessments for each option, as well as consideration of their operational, commercial and technical viability.</p>

<p>As part of its final report in summer 2015, it should also provide materials, based on this detailed analysis, which will support the Government in preparing a National Policy Statement to accelerate the resolution of any future planning applications for major airports infrastructure. </p>
