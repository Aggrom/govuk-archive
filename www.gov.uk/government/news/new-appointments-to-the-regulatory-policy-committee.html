<p>The RPC has been an ad hoc advisory committee for two years. Recognising its importance to the regulatory agenda, the Government recently reconstituted RPC as an advisory non-departmental public body (NDPB) sponsored by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).</p>

<p>The RPC will continue to provide expert, independent advice on the quality of analysis and evidence supporting policy decisions on new regulatory and deregulatory proposals prior to submission to the Reducing Regulation Committee (RRC), a Cabinet sub-committee.</p>

<p>Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:</p>

<p>“Good evidence behind Government policy making is essential, especially when we’re trying to change the culture of Whitehall. The RPC is a vital part of our reducing regulation agenda, and the success of the One in, One out rule, which is why we’ve decided to put it on a formal institutional basis.</p>

<p>“I welcome Michael’s appointment as Chair. He has been involved since its beginning and will provide welcome continuity and experience. I am sure that the new appointees to the Committee will continue the excellent work of the RPC.”</p>

<p>Michael Gibbons said:</p>

<hr>
<p>“I am extremely pleased to be appointed as Chair of the independent Regulatory Policy Committee.</p>

<p>“I believe the RPC has helped to achieve a great deal over the last two years, but it is clear there is much still to do. I am therefore very much looking forward, together with the members of the Committee, to making further progress in helping to achieve better regulatory outcomes.”</p>

<p>Michael Gibbons has held a very wide range of commercial and public appointments including: Managing Director of Powergen’s Gas Business; Member of the Gas Consumers Council; Director of 2Co Power (Yorkshire); Member of the ECSC Joint Consultative Committee and Regional Councillor of the CBI.  </p>
