<p>Ministers will announce substantial new funding awards to boost the UK life sciences industry, as UK and international delegates meet in London for the British Business Embassy Healthcare and Life Sciences summit.   </p>

<p>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley and Universities and Science Minister David Willetts announced that the first awards totalling £10 million from Government’s £180 million Biomedical Catalyst have been awarded to fourteen UK universities and 18 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). These awards from the Medical Research Council and the Technology Strategy Board will support UK academics and businesses on the first vital step in exploring the market potential of their early-stage scientific ideas.   </p>

<p>David Willetts also announced that the Medical Research Council and a consortium of 10 UK Government and charity research funders have invested £19 million to establish four e-health research centres in London, Manchester, Dundee and Swansea. The new centres will enable the UK to make more effective use of electronic health data - a field with huge possibilities for health care delivery and the understanding of disease.  </p>

<p>Yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the Olympic drug-testing laboratories, located in Harlow, will be converted into a £10 million world-class research centre. The MRC-NIHR Phenome Centre, the first of its kind in the world, will use cutting edge facilities developed for London 2012 to help develop better and more targeted treatment for patients, and will enable researchers to explore the characteristics of disease in order to develop new drugs and treatments for patients.   </p>

<p>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said:  </p>

<p>“We want to create a world-class NHS that makes the latest and best treatments available to patients.   </p>

<p>“Our investment in the new MRC-NIHR Phenome Centre, the first of its kind, promises better targeted treatments for patients with a wide range of common diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and dementia.  </p>

<p>“It’s part of the record funding made available for biomedical and clinical research through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), to support studies including those funded though the Biomedical Catalyst programme.”  </p>

<p>Minister for Life Sciences David Willetts said:  </p>

<p>“The UK has one of the world’s largest and most productive life science sectors. We have cutting edge industries such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and medical technologies. We attract almost 10 per cent of the world’s pharmaceutical R&amp;D funding.  </p>

<p>“The Global Business Summit on Life Sciences will introduce some of the world’s most important and influential sector leaders to see what the UK have to offer.  </p>

<p>“It will also highlight how UK innovation continues to flourish and how the industry collaborates, to produce world class services, products and individuals.   </p>

<p>“I am delighted to be a part of this event, which positions the UK as a firm leader in the world of life sciences.”  </p>

<p>The Life Sciences Day is one of 18 global business summits being organised by UK Trade &amp; Investment to promote UK businesses and facilitate international trade during the Olympic and Paralympic Games.   </p>

<p>**UK-international business  </p>

<p>**International business to be announced by firms at today’s summit today includes:   </p>

<ul>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>300 UK and international healthcare delegates will discuss the ways in which change in healthcare can be achieved through collaboration between industry, academia and healthcare providers.

    <p>The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries.’ It set four ambitions in the <a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf">‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)</a>, published at Budget 2011:  </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>To create the most competitive tax system in the G20</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UK scientists are some of the best in the world, winning 76 Nobel prizes for their scientific achievements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research is an important factor: the UK Life Sciences industry spends almost £4.4 billion on R&amp;D in the UK each year. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK’s research is the most productive and efficient in the G8. It produces more publications and citations per researcher and per pound of public funding than any of its major competitors. </p>

    <p>The National Health Service is a key pillar for UK Life Sciences; it is unique, delivering “cradle to grave” care for the UK’s 62 million residents. Not only is it one of the largest purchasers of Life Sciences products in the world, spending around £20 billion a year on goods and services, but it is also a proven research partner for developing and evaluating medicines and technologies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, through the NIHR, invests £1 billion annually to equip the NHS to carry out world-leading applied health research. In addition to funding internationally recognised research programmes, the NIHR supports research facilities in the country’s leading NHS hospital/university partnerships focused on pulling important biomedical discoveries into the clinic. This expertise in early-stage research is complemented by the NIHR Clinical Research Network, which supported delivery of 3,200 clinical research studies in the NHS involving over half a million patients in 2010/11.   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK medical technology sector has over 3,100 companies generating £15 billion turnover and employing some 64,000 people, producing a diverse range of products from positron emission tomography for advanced imaging and diagnosis to surgical gowns and instruments.</p>
  </li>
