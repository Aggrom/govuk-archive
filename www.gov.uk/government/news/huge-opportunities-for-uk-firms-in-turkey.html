<p>The visit is the first by a UK Business Secretary for a decade and underlines the importance of the two countries ambition to double bilateral trade by 2015.</p>

<p>This visit builds on that of Minister for Trade and Investment Lord Green in April this year, and follows the Prime Minister David Cameron’s establishment of a new UK-Turkey Strategic Partnership with Prime Minister Erdo?an in July 2010.</p>

<p>Business Secretary, Dr Vince Cable, said: </p>

<p>“I am delighted to be visiting Turkey and bringing British companies with me. Turkey has an enviable record of economic growth over the last decade; reaching almost 9 per cent last year.</p>

<p>“Turkey is an important business hub in the region - with its reach into the EU, the Middle East and Central Asia. Istanbul is already establishing itself as a regional centre for financial services. </p>

<p>“There are big opportunities for both British and Turkish firms to seize. The size and stature of the delegation accompanying me here signals the clear and growing importance of the Turkish market for British companies.”</p>

<p>Dr Cable is visiting Ankara and Istanbul from 25-28 September. During this three-day visit, he will meet senior Turkish Ministers and government officials. He will sign the UK-Turkey Knowledge Partnership with Turkish Economy Minister Zafer Ça?layan, and attend the formal launch of this collaboration at Sabanci University in Istanbul. He will also make a keynote speech at the Istanbul Financial Centre Summit. </p>

<p>With the accompanying business delegation, Dr Cable will attend a working lunch and meet representatives from Turkish business organisations including the Business Network and TUSKON. </p>

<p>Members of the UK business delegation include household British names such as Fosters+Partners, Rolls Royce, GSK and Legal &amp; General, as well as innovative SMEs such as Redmint Communications and Poke. </p>

<p>Elizabeth Fells, CBI Head of International Strategy, who is on the business delegation said: </p>

<p>“The UK is a significant investor in Turkey, with more than 2,000 UK companies operating throughout the country. With Turkey’s economy growing fast, and with strong prospects for continued expansion, there is considerable potential for the UK’s trade and investment ties with Turkey to be strengthened further. “</p>

<p>The launch of the Tesco Supplier Academy Initiative will also take place during the visit. </p>

<p>Tesco Kipa CEO, Paul Ritchie, said: </p>

<p>“Turkey is an important market for us as a business based in the UK and we are keen to contribute to an already prosperous UK-Turkey economic relationship. Tesco Kipa currently has 131 stores across Turkey and we have ambitious plans to increase this to 150 stores by the end of the financial year. The great benefit to operating in Turkey is that we can develop new partnerships, knowledge and skills, which we can ultimately transfer back to the UK retail market.”</p>

The property market is incredibly dynamic, with the opportunity for considerable growth - the combination of a strong economy and skilled local resources has created an attractive marketplace. But for architects, it’s the many layers of Turkey’s rich cultural legacy that make the country most compelling - its history is incredible.

<p><strong>UK-Turkey fact file</strong></p>

<hr>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>The UK and Turkey have a strong and growing trade relationship across many sectors. Turkey is the UK’s 20th largest export market and bilateral trade is worth over £9 billion per year. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a commitment to doubling bilateral trade by 2015, this is growing rapidly. UK exports to Turkey rose by 30% Jan-Jun 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, and Turkish exports to the UK rose by 11% for the same period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turkey’s economy grew by 11% at the start of 2010, and is projected to be the second fastest-growing economy in the world by 2017 and Europe’s second largest economy by 2050. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turkey’s population of 76 million makes it one of the world’s largest markets; the average age of the population is 28 against 38 for Russia, 39 for UK and 44 for Germany, giving Turkey more young people than any of the European Union’s twenty seven countries. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That young, well-educated population also means that Turkey offers a responsive workforce as well as a lively consumer market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK is very well placed to do even more business with Turkey. We are already the second largest investor in Turkey, with more than 1,800 UK companies operating there, including many household names such as Tesco, Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
