<p>Michael Seals MBE, Ann Cartwright, Steve Brown, Cllr Gary Hunt, Cllr Jon Collins, Cllr Geoff Stevens and Prof Philip Tasker will serve from 14 December 2010 until the RDA closes.</p>

<p>The Minister commented:</p>

<hr>
<p>“As we move toward a new framework for our regional economies, it is important that the development agencies are equipped with the leadership to ensure the transition period is a smooth one. </p>

<p>“The skills and experience of these board members will be a valuable asset during this time and I hope they will continue to work with us to ensure an efficient evolutionary process.”</p>

<p>Dr Bryan Jackson, Chairman of EMDA, said:</p>

<p>“During this period of significant change, it is crucial that we retain the expertise of our Board members to ensure any new arrangements support the economic welfare of the region and include the voice of business. </p>

<p>“As a business-led organisation, we understand business needs and priorities and will continue to highlight these so the region and companies based here can innovate, grow and prosper.”</p>

<p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>Regional Development Agency non-executive Board member posts attract a remuneration of £8,666 per year for a minimum time commitment of two days per month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continued terms are up until the RDA closes, and no later than 13 December 2012.  Final closure of RDAs is likely to be completed by 31 March 2012 following legislation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RDAs are business led organisations, promoting and co-ordinating economic growth and development, enterprise and regeneration.  The Coalition Government has made the decision to support the  creation of local enterprise partnerships to replace RDAs.  On that basis the decision was made not to continue with further Board member recruitment.  The continued terms are necessary to ensure that the RDA Chairs are able effectively to manage their Board membership up until closure, and that membership does not fall below the minimum requirement of eight, as stated in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original appointments were made following open competition in accordance with the requirement set down in the Commissioner for Public Appointments Code of Practice.  All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process.  However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Michael Seals, Ann Cartwright, Steve Brown, and Prof Philip Tasker have not declared any political activity undertaken during the past five years. Gary Hunt is a Councillor and Party officer for the Liberal Democrat party.  Jon Collins is a Councillor for the Labour party. Geoff Stevens is a District and Town Councillor for the Conservative party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Michael Seals, Ann Cartwright, Steve Brown, Philip Tasker, Gary Hunt, Jon Collins and Geoff Stevens do not hold any further ministerial public appointments.</p>
