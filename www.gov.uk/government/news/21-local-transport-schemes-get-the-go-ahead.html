<p>Communities across England will benefit from <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-major-transport-scheme-decisions/">£854m worth of investment in 21 local transport schemes</a>, Transport Secretary Justine Greening said today. This is in addition to the 20 schemes, worth £574m, which were announced in the Autumn Statement at the end of last month.</p>

<p>All the projects have been through a stringent assessment process to ensure they offer value for money and are affordable for both the Government and the local area.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Transport infrastructure is central to growth, and I am announcing funding for a further 21 local major transport schemes. Along with the schemes announced last month we’ve supported investment of over £1.4bn that will strengthen local economies and improve local transport links for communities across the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost all journeys begin and end on local authority networks, which provide the crucial links that allow people and businesses to prosper. We are investing in schemes that will provide better access to jobs and services, reduce congestion and enable more goods to move more easily around our country. This will be £1.4bn invested in local communities to build the transport system we need to get the economy back on track.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other schemes;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>A684 Bedale Bypass</strong>. The Department has offered a lower level of funding (£35.9m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £42.1m) to North Yorkshire County Council for this scheme, with a final decision as to whether to accept this offer required of the local council by the end of January 2012.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Norwich Northern Distributor Road (NNDR)</strong>.

The new road runs to the East and North of Norwich with a new junction onto the A47 at Postwick (£86.5m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £111.1m).</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects which will now be considered by the Department in the Spring are;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Leeds New Generation Transport</strong>. The Department has not yet been provided with sufficient evidence with which to assess the value for money of this scheme, as some of the data is relatively new and cannot yet be verified. However, the Department recognises that a strong strategic case has been made and so has given the promoters until 31 March 2012 to update their business case. A decision will be made within two months of that.</li>
  <li>
<strong>SERT (South Essex Rapid Transit)</strong>. The Department has not yet been provided with sufficient evidence with which to assess the value for money of this scheme and has given the promoters until 31 March 2012 to update their business case. A decision will be made within two months of that.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Waverley Link Road</strong>. The Waverley Link Road proposed by Rotherham Borough Council is opposed in its current form by Sheffield City Council, whose land is required for the proposed route. The Department recognises that there is a case for additional capacity in this area but the currently proposed scheme does not appear to be deliverable. Rotherham Borough Council are invited to work with Sheffield and other stakeholders and to propose a resolution to the issue by 31 March 2012.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Bexhill - Hastings Link Road</strong> Ministers recognise the critically important role that transport improvements could play in the regeneration of the Bexhill - Hastings area and the economic case underpinning the Bexhill - Hastings Link Road, though they are also aware of concerns regarding the proposed scheme, including its environmental impact. Before Ministers take a final decision on the scheme they want to be sure that it offers the best approach for regenerating the area and also to consider other transport options to achieve this, including local trunk roads such as the A21, A259 and local rail. They also want to consider whether further environmental mitigation measures could be deployed to address the impacts of the proposed Bexhill-Hastings scheme. Over the next three months the Department will work alongside the scheme’s promoters and other local and regional partners to gather further evidence on the optimal solution for the area. The Department would intend to make a decision swiftly thereafter.</li>
</ul>
<p>The department also today confirmed the individual allocations to local transport authorities of the £50m top-up to the Integrated Transport Block grant announced by the Chancellor in the Autumn Statement. The top-up will be allocated in accordance with the formula for the Integrated Transport Block grant.</p>

<h3 id="notes-to-editors">Notes to editors</h3>

<ol>
<li>The Department for Transport challenged the promoters of 45 schemes to reduce the costs whilst maintaining value for money.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-major-transport-schemes-development-pool-update">Details of the schemes announced today and of the 20 schemes given approval in the Growth Review</a></li>
  <li>The confirmed schemes can now progress to seek statutory powers and formal tender prices, if they have not already done so.</li>
  <li>North Yorkshire County Council, in their bid for the A684 Bedale Bypass, included an amount for additional risks that no other promoter included. The original request was for £43.7m whilst our revised offer is £35.9m. North Yorkshire must provide a response to the Department by 31st January or funding for the scheme will be withdrawn.</li>
  <li>The Integrated Transport Block Top-Up comes with the same grant conditions that the department set out for the 2011/12 allocation, that is, it is capital grant but otherwise un-ring fenced. Full details of individual allocations will be available on the website but in short authorities can expect an additional sixth to their previously announced 2011/12 annual allocation.</li>
