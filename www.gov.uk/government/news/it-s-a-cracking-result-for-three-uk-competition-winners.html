<p>Children between the ages of 4-16 were asked to come up with ideas for a theme park or theme park ride as part of the Intellectual Property Office’s Cracking Ideas campaign.</p>

<p>The overall winners, who were selected by Merlin Crossingham, Creative Director for Wallace &amp; Gromit at Aardman Animations, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arianwen Skyrme-Croft, Cwmbran for ‘Toy World’, 4 to 7 age group. Arianwen created a mix of cracking ideas for her theme park including a puppet show with a central mirror so the audience can interact, a colourful storyboard for a musical, a magical TV advert and a logo where the letters feature things found in the park. If visitors are feeling peckish after all the ‘Toy World’ fun they can dine on food in the twinkling star shaped restaurant appropriately named ‘Shining Star’</li>
  <li>Sula Maclean, Chepstow for ‘The Ocean Park, A Whale of a theme park’, 8 to 11 age group. Sula created a roller coaster where visitors travelled in Viking ships in water-tight bubbles allowing them to enter a giant tank filled with fish. Intrepid riders experience an exciting loop the loop whilst clever technology ensures they don’t run out of air. Sula produced a multi-coloured logo to promote the park on posters, newspapers, TV and radio as well as on-line adverts</li>
  <li>Heather Rigby, Haverfordwest for ‘Levitation Space Coaster’, 12 to 16 age group. Using a vibrant logo Heather created the ‘Levitation Space Coaster’, which would levitate daredevils around the world and all the way into space. Heather also provided a colourful advertisement for her ride using her unique logo and slogan, ‘The Levitation Space Coaster - where you can ride ALL the way into Space… extra fast!’ She also remembered to protect her advert using the internationally recognised symbol for copyright.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the presentations, Minister for Intellectual Property Baroness Wilcox said:</p>

<p>“Congratulations to the three winners who really have showed great creativity and innovative ideas for the competition. It was incredibly difficult to judge with over 6,000 fantastic entries to choose from.</p>

<p>“It’s so important for children to learn the skills that will help them later in life. The competition is proof that there is a great crop of youngsters who have the skill and ability to be creative and think about how to gain financial benefits from their original ideas. Hopefully they will continue to develop their entrepreneurial skills which is great news for the future of the UK and its economic growth.”</p>

<p>Eleven regional winners were at the Newcastle Life Science Centre today (7 July) where the IPO sponsored Wallace &amp; Gromit present… A World of Cracking Ideas exhibition is currently on display. The overall winners were presented with a bespoke Wallace &amp; Gromit trophy created by Aardman’s model makers and a family day pass for Chessington World of Adventures. </p>

<p>Creative Director for Wallace &amp; Gromit at Aardman Animations, Merlin Crossingham said:</p>

<p>“I was thrilled to see that so many great ideas had been submitted to this year’s Cracking Ideas competition. The children really created some brilliant theme parks which combined Wallace &amp; Gromit inspired inventions and an understanding of intellectual property which helped make each entry original. </p>

<p>“Choosing a winner this year was really tough as there were so many good ideas, so well done to everyone who took part, and keep those inventive juices flowing”.</p>

<p>TV presenter Gareth Jones awarded the winners with their prizes and said:</p>

<p>“I have been involved with Cracking Ideas for a number of years now and I am always thrilled to hear the frankly brilliant and highly original ideas that young people around the country have come up with in the competition. </p>

<p>“I feel I may well be meeting the people who will design and create or invent our future.”</p>

<p><strong>Cracking Ideas Competition 2010/11 - Regional Winners</strong></p>

<p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong><em>**</em></p>

<p><strong>8 - 11</strong></p>

<p>John Rabbett, Londonderry - Coaster World</p>

<p>John developed a clever mobile map for visitors to his ‘Coaster World’ theme park. His ingenious gizmo ensures visitors can locate where they are, plan their route and always know when the next thrilling ride is available. Plus, John’s clever marketing means his innovative mobile map is free with your park entry ticket … always a winner!</p>

<p><strong>12 - 16</strong></p>

<p>Tyrone Wade, Londonderry - Belter Skelter</p>

<p>Tyrone created a brand new optical illusion roller coaster called ‘Belter Skelter’. The ride whizzes through four distinct tunnels each with its own trickery and illusion. Riders experience shrinking fog effects, a twisting tunnel with light effect, a fake fly trap, mirror magic and scary collision illusions before a dramatic wind effect at the exit.</p>

<p>Tyrone created a deceptively simple and colourful logo for ‘Belter Skelter’ and accompanied it with a clever advert to promote the attraction.</p>

<p><strong>Scotland</strong><em>**</em></p>

<p><strong>4 - 7</strong></p>

<p>Lewis Smith, Glasgow - Wacky World</p>

<p>The design featured a stomach churning fun run, complete with loops and gravity defying drops along with a very colourful logo for ‘Wacky World’ featuring loops and stars. Lewis plans to promote his fun-filled attraction using his copyrighted material on the internet.</p>

<p><strong>8 - 11</strong></p>

<p>Jamie-Lee Gillan, Glasgow - Mouthwatering Planet</p>

<p>Jamie-Lee developed a new queue busting ‘Super Watch’ gizmo and a delectable ride design with seats shaped like burgers, chips and marshmallows and even a vat of chocolate to dive into! Called ‘Mouthwatering Planet’, Jamie-Lee created a lip-smacking multi-coloured logo to accompany her cracking idea.</p>

<p><strong>12-16</strong></p>

<p>Josh Gracie - Confection World, where every day is sweet!</p>

<p>Josh developed an edible idea consisting of a gondola scrumptiously named ‘The Choclatier’ which floats on a river of chocolate. If that’s not enough to make your mouth water there are plenty of sweet treats like lollies and candy canes along the way to tempt visitors.</p>

<p>Consisting of a vibrant design with lots of clever imagery, Josh’s park also has a catchy slogan - ‘A sweet, treat of a day out where Mum never says no! Where there’s non-stop chocadoodle fun!’</p>

<p><strong>Wales</strong><em>**</em></p>

<p><strong>4 - 7</strong></p>

<p>Arianwen Skyrme-Croft, Cwmbran - Toy World</p>

<p>Arianwen Created a multitude of cracking ideas for her theme park called “Toy World” including a puppet show with a central mirror so the audience can interact; a colourful storyboard for a musical, magical TV advert and a logo where the letters feature things found in the park. </p>

<p>If visitors are feeling peckish after all the ‘Toy World’ fun they can dine on a sparkling array of food in the twinkling star shaped restaurant appropriately named ‘Shining Star’. </p>

<p>Arianwen’s novel bistro design was entered into the competition as part of a series of innovation challenges on the Cracking Ideas website, ‘Shining Star’ being Arianwen’s response to the challenge highlighting the intellectual property right - Design.</p>

<p><strong>8 - 11</strong></p>

<p>Sula Maclean, Chepstow - The Ocean Park</p>

<p>Sula created a roller coaster where visitors travelled in Viking ships in water-tight bubbles allowing them to enter a giant tank filled with fish. Intrepid riders experience an exciting loop the loop whilst clever technology ensures they don’t run out of air.</p>

<p>Called ‘The Ocean Park, A Whale of a Theme Park’ Sula produced a multi-coloured logo to promote the park on posters, newspapers, TV and radio as well as on-line adverts.</p>

<p><strong>12 - 16</strong></p>

<p>Heather Rigby, Haverfordwest - The Levitation Space Coaster</p>

<p>Using a vibrant logo Heather created the ‘Levitation Space Coaster’, which would levitate daredevils around the world and all the way into space.</p>

<p>Heather also provided a colourful advertisement for her ride using her unique logo and slogan, ‘The Levitation Space Coaster - where you can ride ALL the way into Space… extra fast!’ She also remembered to protect her advert using the internationally recognised symbol for copyright.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>England</strong><em>**</em></p>

<p><strong>4 - 7</strong></p>

<p>Isaac Gibirdi, Preston - Elemental Earth<em>**</em></p>

<p>Isaac’s park is called ‘Elemental Earth’ with interesting imagery portraying the four different elements of fire, water, earth and air. Intrepid visitors can ride a rollercoaster which transforms into a submarine appropriately called ‘The Flood’, linking cleverly into the theme of his park.</p>

<p>A spine-tingling poster with the slogan ‘Can you survive the elements?’ would advertise Isaac’s park on TV, radio, newspapers and websites.</p>

<p><strong>8 - 11</strong></p>

<p>Sasha Jackson and Olivia Thomas, Esher, Surrey - Maelstrom Mania</p>

<p>Sasha and Olivia’s theme park ‘Maelstrom Maniya’ features numerous innovative curiosities including a huge eyeball shaped ride where individual pods are blinked through the pupil in the middle - a thrilling ride apparently recommended for teenagers only! </p>

<p>The two member team also developed an intriguing visitors guide and map which folds like a paper aeroplane and tells guests where to find attractions such as the ‘Doomsday Falls’, ‘Twister Slide’, ‘Tornado’ (with anxiety for fun!) and the scarily titled ‘Fight For Life’ as well as the omnipresent theme park feature - the exit shop!</p>

<p>Sarah Farrow, Anna Moore, Emma Clarke, Sam Bodza and Dan Raybould, Church Stretton, Shropshire - Lava Springs</p>

<p>Working as a team within a Design and Technology project and using creative challenges on the Cracking Ideas website they developed a theme park called ‘Lava Springs’ based on the dramatic natural wonder of volcanoes.</p>

<p>Undertaking different roles within the group they created numerous and detailed components for ‘Lava Springs’ including meticulously constructed models of the new ride explaining how it takes intrepid visitors on a journey through the volcano’s magma chamber before shooting them out of the top like lava. </p>

<p>A replica of the Magma Cafe as well as a lively advertising poster and details of the thought process behind the logo ensure that every visitor to the ‘Lava Springs’ theme park would have the time of their lives.</p>
