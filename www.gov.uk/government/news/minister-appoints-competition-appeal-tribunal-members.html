<p>Consumer Minister Edward Davey said:</p>

<p>“The members I am appointing today represent a range of expertise, gained at the highest levels of business, academia, the law and other fields. They will help ensure the continued authority and effectiveness of the Tribunal.”</p>

<p>Cases are heard before a Tribunal consisting of three members: either the President or a member of the panel of chairmen, who are judicial appointments, and two ordinary members. </p>

<p>The ordinary members are selected for their expertise in law, business, accountancy, economics and other related fields.</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>

<hr>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>The new members have all been appointed for four years automatically renewable for a further four years, and will be paid according to the amount of time that they spend working for the Tribunal, based on a daily rate of £350. The appointments carry no right of pension, gratuity or allowance on its termination. The appointments will commence on 4 January 2011.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>
    <p>All appointments are made on merit, and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity to be made public. None of the new members are politically active.   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although these appointments do not come within the remit of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA), they have been made following OCPA best practice.</p>
  </li>

Providing support staff for the CAT is one of the functions of the Competition Service. The CS has 14 full time equivalents. It is headed by the Registrar, appointed by BIS. The CAT itself consists of a President, appointed by the Lord Chancellor, a panel of chairmen, also appointed by the Lord Chancellor and a panel of “lay” Members.
