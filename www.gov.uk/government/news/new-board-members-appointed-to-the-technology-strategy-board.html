<p>“Doug Richard and Hazel Moore will bring a breadth of experience to their roles on the Board of the Technology Strategy Board. I am looking forward to working alongside them and continuing to work closely with Sir Christopher Snowden, Sara Murray and Stewart Davies. The challenges now facing the Technology Strategy Board are to develop the package of support we offer for our small and medium sized firms and to continue to boost business investment in technology and innovation to ensure UK success in the global economy.”  </p>

<p>“It’s great to be able to welcome such experienced and knowledgeable new members to the Board and to retain some existing strengths with the reappointments. The Technology Strategy Board is the UK’s innovation agency and so it’s essential that we have a rich and diverse pool of business expertise on the Governing Board. It’s our job to help ensure the organisation builds on its current strengths and continues to encourage innovation and business growth.

    <p>The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries.’ It set four ambitions in the <a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf">‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)</a>, published at Budget 2011:  </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>To create the most competitive tax system in the G20</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.  </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  </p>
