<p>Stuart Evans, Cllr Paul Burall, Sheila Childerhouse, and Karen Livingstone will serve from 14 December 2010 until the RDA closes.  The Minister also announced a year extension for Cllr Marco Cereste, who will accumulate 10 years service on the Board.</p>

<p>The Minister commented:</p>

<p>” As we move toward a new framework for our regional economies, it is important that the development agencies are equipped with the leadership to ensure the transition period is a smooth one. </p>

<p>“The skills and experience of these board members will be a valuable asset during this time and I hope they will continue to work with us to ensure an efficient evolutionary process.”</p>

<p>Will Pope, Chair of EEDA, said:</p>

<p>“I welcome Stuart Evans’ reappointment to the EEDA board and also the extension of the appointments of four other board members. Karen Livingstone, Paul Burall, Sheila Childerhouse and Marco Cereste, as well as Stuart, have provided invaluable contributions over the last few years to our mission of improving the economy of the East of England.</p>

<p>“The key role of the board in this period of change is to ensure that we deliver on business support today and also a smooth and professional transition to the new arrangements for economic development, working with local authorities and businesses to plan for the future. </p>

<p>“Over the coming months we will continue to retain a sharp focus on supporting local businesses helping them to access the right funding, people and customers.”</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>The continued terms for Stuart Evans, Paul Burall, Sheila Childerhouse, and Karen Livingstone are up until the RDA closes. Marco Cereste has been offered a year extension up until December 2011 (the Commissioner for Public Appointments granted the years extension on the basis that he will have served 10 years on the Board which is the maximum term in office. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RDAs are business-led organisations, promoting and co-ordinating </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>economic growth and development, enterprise and regeneration. </p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>The Coalition Government announced the creation of local enterprise partnerships to replace RDAs.  On that basis the decision was made not to continue with further Board member recruitment.  The continued terms of Board members are necessary to ensure that the RDA Chairs are able effectively to manage their Board membership up until closure, and that membership does not fall below the minimum requirement of eight, as stated in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original appointments were made following open competition in accordance with the requirement set down in the Commissioner for Public Appointments Code of Practice.  All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process.  However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stuart Evans has not declared any political activity being undertaken in the past 5 years.  Karen Livingstone is an active member of the Labour party;  Marco Cereste is aConservative Councillor and Leader of Peterborough City Council; Paul Burall is a Councillor for the Liberal Democrat party, and Sheila Childerhouse’s political activity has been undertaken on behalf of the Independent party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sheila Childerhouse holds a further ministerial appointment as Chair NHS Norfolk which attracts a remuneration of £39k per annum for a time commitment of 3 days a week.  Paul Burall, Karen Livingstone, Stuart Evans and Marco Cereste do not hold any further ministerial public appointments.</p>
