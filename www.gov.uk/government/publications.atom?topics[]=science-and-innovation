    <title>Shaping a UK agri-tech strategy: call for evidence</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has the potential to be at the forefront of developing innovative solutions, and to make fuller use of its agri-science base. Translating fundamental and applied scientific research into innovative technologies, practices and information could enable countries worldwide to meet the food and environmental challenges ahead while also contributing significantly to UK economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its world class plant, animal and environmental research base, the UK is well placed to contribute to the global effort needed to improve the sustainable intensification of agriculture both at home and overseas. This would raise yields without using more land while adapting to climate change, reducing emissions, and maintaining biodiversity and other ecosystem services. It will involve engaging a very wide range of disciplines including natural (plant, animal, agronomy) and social scientists, engineers, and experts in risk management, economics and modelling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is developing a long-term agri-tech strategy focused on knowledge transfer and the application of technology to the agricultural sector. This is part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/speeches/vince-cable-industrial-strategy-september-2012"&gt;UK Industrial Strategy&lt;/a&gt; announced by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills in September 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This call for evidence seeks to establish a strong evidence base from the existing knowledge in the agricultural sector. It will inform our understanding of role of agricultural technology, its strengths and weaknesses and the potential benefits to global food production. We aim to gain better understanding of potential opportunities for UK businesses including growth in exports of products, technology and know-how, and inward investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/agri-tech-strategy-call-for-evidence-Oct-2012"&gt;Respond to the online survey&lt;/a&gt; **&lt;/p&gt;
