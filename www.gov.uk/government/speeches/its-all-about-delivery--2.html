<p><em>Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version.</em></p>

<p>Are you a veteran if you’ve done the same job for five years?</p>

<p>Normally the answer would be no - unless of course you cover the Government’s housing portfolio like I do.</p>

<p>During this time I’ve seen a total of eight - yes eight - opposing Housing Ministers come and go.</p>

<p>But does this matter?</p>

<p>Well yes if you care about the state of housing in this country.</p>

<p>An endless reshuffling of the ministerial pack meant an endless reshuffling of ideas and initiatives.</p>

<p>But this conveyer belt of policies didn’t deliver - and we all watched in horror as the housing sector entered its darkest hours since the 1920s.</p>

<p>Now, the Prime Minister launched our Housing Strategy last November to great fanfare.</p>

<p>He made it very clear - housing will be centre stage of the nation’s economic recovery.</p>

<p>I’m very proud of that, naturally.</p>

<p>But what I really want is to bring the proposals in the strategy to life - and quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to see more new homes - built to the highest quality.</li>
  <li>I want to see housebuilders helped to build these homes - where communities want them.</li>
  <li>And I want to see more people buy their first home.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t a question of political preference.</p>

<p>It’s people’s lives we’re talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li>the lives of the hundreds of thousands of families on waiting lists</li>
  <li>the young couples desperate to move into their own home</li>
  <li>the council tenants who aspire to buy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there’s no time to hang about.</p>

<p>And I’ve been very clear with my Department: no ifs, no buts.</p>

<p>We’re getting on with the job - and we’re moving at pace.</p>

<h3 id="progress-so-far">Progress so far</h3>

<p>It’s less than three months since we published the housing strategy and six weeks before the budget - so let’s check in on progress.</p>

<p>Our action to get the country building again is playing a vital and central role in putting the economy on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>Take our <strong>Get Britain Building fund</strong>.</p>

<p>£420 million to start shovel-ready sites where that injection of capital can get the whole thing moving.</p>

<p>The prospectus was quickly published.</p>

<p>And I can announce that we have already identified 18 of the most difficult stalled sites on public land - on which work will begin soon.</p>

<p>All the details will be published today on the Homes and Communities Agency website.</p>

<p>For the rest of the cash we’ve made it as simple as we possibly can to bid by halving the paperwork - and we’ve opened the door to all types of firms to compete.</p>

<p>The final set of bids will be considered next month - and already we can see the quality of some of the proposals.</p>

<p>We were hoping to start work on the first sites in autumn.</p>

<p>But today I can tell you we’re intending for the first ground to be broken considerably earlier.</p>

<p>Watch this space.</p>

<p>We also want to make land available so more homes can be built where people want them.</p>

<p>So today I can confirm that we’ve identified surplus public land with enough capacity for over 80,000 new homes.</p>

<p>Putting ourselves well on track to release enough land for 100,000 homes by 2015.</p>

<p>But I want to move even faster.</p>

<p>So I’m working with another six Government departments together with other large organisations including the BBC, Network Rail and the Royal Mail to identify further disused land.</p>

<p>This is not just about numbers.</p>

<p>Unlike the era of top-down targets we want to build new homes with the support of communities - not just build a sense of resentment and injustice.</p>

<p>That’s why we introduced the <strong>New Homes Bonus</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s year two of this Government and it’s year two of the New Homes Bonus.</p>

<p>Today I can announce over £430 million for communities who helped deliver 159,000 homes last year - 22,000 of these being empty homes brought back into use.</p>

<p>It’s more than double the previous year.</p>

<p>The Bonus payments last for six years - so communities can expect to see more cash increases for several years.</p>

<p>That’s the way we like to do things:</p>

<ul>
<li>give councils and communities genuine choice and genuine reasons to say “yes” to growth</li>
  <li>and let local people to see and feel the benefits of development in their neighbourhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Already the Bonus is being spent in ways that are changing minds and attitudes.</p>

<p>Take Wychavon in Worcestershire - not a big council area by any means. But now there’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>£200,000 of New Homes Bonus cash for supporting regeneration projects.</li>
  <li>£100,000 going to local charities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bonus has gone from being a piece of paper to established policy.</p>

<p>And it’s here to stay.</p>

<p>So it’s now time for all councils to talk to the people in their area about how they want their Bonus spent.</p>

<p>And let’s be clear - it is the community’s Bonus. So it is only fair that they take part in discussions and any decisions about its use.</p>

<p>Of course it’s no good just helping housebuilders build homes - <strong>we need people to buy them</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why at the heart of our housing strategy we’ve committed to go the extra mile for those aspiring to get on the housing ladder.</p>

<p>The deposits needed to buy a home have gone through the roof.</p>

<p>For millions of young people the desire to buy a home is no longer a dream - but a distant fantasy.</p>

<p>We are going help them.</p>

<p>Starting in March the <strong>NewBuy Guarantee</strong> will give thousands of prospective buyers the chance to buy a home with a fraction of the deposit normally required.</p>

<p>It’ll help people buying a new-build property - be that a house or a flat with a value up to £500,000 - get a 95 per cent loan.</p>

<p>Where a buyer may typically need a £40,000 deposit - a £10,000 deposit will put them in a property of their own.</p>

<p>Today I’m publishing details of who will be eligible for this support.</p>

<p>Anyone interested can now see on my department’s website if this scheme would work for them.</p>

<p>And because we want to help everyone achieve their aspirations, to feel the pride of ownership - we’re scrapping the miserly restrictions on the level of discounts under <strong>Right to Buy</strong>.</p>

<p>Up to 100,000 tenants will have the opportunity to buy their own home.</p>

<p>It’s great news for every hardworking family who have done well for themselves and want to get on.</p>

<p>But we’ve also been clear that it’s vital to keep up the number of affordable homes.</p>

<p>So this will be a one-out, one-in policy.</p>

<p>In other words a new home built for every home sold.</p>

<p>Good news for all those on the housing waiting lists.</p>

<p>That’s why we wasted no time and I published the proposals before Christmas.</p>

<p>But I want to go further.</p>

<p>Right to Buy restrictions aren’t the only bureaucratic burden on council tenants that should be removed.</p>

<p>I also want to end the multi-billion pound tax inflicted on tenants by the complex system for council housing finance.</p>

<p><strong>The Tenants’ Tax</strong> is the offspring of that arcane creature we call the Housing Revenue Account Subsidy System.</p>

<p>Not many people outside this room would have ever heard of that one.</p>

<p>But it affects millions of council tenants.</p>

<p>Councils collect rents from their tenants - then every year they wait patiently to hear Whitehall’s decision about what they are allowed to keep.</p>

<p>Bureaucracy at its bonkers best.</p>

<p>Authorities that have more tenants and collect millions in social rent only keep a fraction of the cash.</p>

<p>A tax on millions of council tenants - because as far as they are concerned, their rent just disappears into a Treasury a black hole.</p>

<p>The Localism Act paved the way for the long-awaited and sorely needed removal of this system.</p>

<p>And now, just two months after the Act achieved Royal Assent, I’m confirming today the details of an historic settlement that puts councils back in charge.</p>

<p>The new system will level the playing field.</p>

<p>Council landlords will keep the rent they collect - giving them an average 15 per cent more to spend on maintaining homes.</p>

<p>Less fun for bureaucrats - but at last a direct link between the rent councils charge and the money they spend.</p>

<p>They will have the financial tools to plan their budgets more effectively.</p>

<p>Modernising and improving the homes of existing tenants - and making it easier to build new affordable houses.</p>

<p>This £19 billion deal may not hit the front pages tomorrow - but it is one of the most substantial and significant steps towards localism in years.</p>

<p>And make no mistake: it is localism that is driving the success of our policies to help families who need affordable homes.</p>

<p><strong>Take our affordable homes programme</strong>.</p>

<p>A smart system with more freedom for those at the sharp end.</p>

<p>Critics have used every opportunity to twist the facts - telling us it won’t work in London, in Hull, in rural or urban areas.</p>

<p>They’ve predicted doom and said this radical new approach will never succeed in the current economic climate.</p>

<p>But I can tell you that today we have 150,000 homes being developed or under contract, and we’re on track for 170,000 by 2015 - 20,000 more than expected.</p>

<p>We’re not just meeting our aspirations - we’re beating them!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is the approach we promised - and it is the approach we have delivered.</p>

<p>It’s more pace and less paperwork.</p>

<p>And as I continue to drive forward the Housing Strategy, you can expect more to come.</p>

<p>The saying goes that patience is a virtue.</p>

<p>But when it comes to:</p>

<ul>
<li>families crying out for new homes</li>
  <li>tenants who want more control</li>
  <li>and communities who want more choice</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m afraid patience is not a virtue I share.</p>

<p>So at last the housing sector has reasons to be optimistic.</p>

<p>Our new approach will:</p>

<ul>
<li>give a helping hand to this generation of homebuyers</li>
  <li>boost the provision of affordable homes</li>
  <li>and help the nation’s housebuilders get building again</li>
</ul>
<p>We have taken decisive action - and we are under no illusion that much more needs to be done.</p>

<p>But no one should doubt our determination to drive through this programme of radical reform to boost our economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p>

<p>And in the process - <strong>help house a nation</strong>.</p>
