<p><em>Transcript of the speech as delivered.</em></p>

<p>Tomorrow, I am off to see how the great city of Birmingham is creating jobs, attracting businesses and promoting growth.</p>

<p>People say that what happens in Birmingham affects the whole West Midlands.</p>

<p>I don’t think so - no what happens in Birmingham affects the whole world.</p>

<p>Birmingham is a world city as important as Boston or Barcelona.</p>

<p>It is a global player, but one playing with its hands tied behind its back.</p>

<p>It was not always so.</p>

<p>Once Joseph Chamberlain ran Birmingham.</p>

<p>That giant city leader.</p>

<p>Introduced primary education.</p>

<p>Cleaned up the water supply.</p>

<p>Built libraries, schools, and museums.</p>

<p>It was the same in Manchester. The same in Leeds  And the same in my old stomping ground of Bradford.</p>

<p>Visit one of those Victorian city halls and you can feel a citadel to civic pride, civic duty and independence.</p>

<p>No waiting for approval from Parliament - much less an instruction manual.</p>

<p>They knew what they wanted to do - but they also had the powers and just got on with it.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise that as powers have been leeched from local government, English cities have declined and stagnated.</p>

<p>The old initiative, the old dynamism, the spirit of activism has all been snatched away.</p>

<p>Much of the energy of modern city leadership is drained away dealing with TLAs - three letter acronyms.</p>

<p>MAAs, LAAs, RSSs.</p>

<p>Can you imagine Joseph Chamberlain sitting meekly filling in forms so that some remote civil servant could measure his performance?</p>

<p>Everything that this Government is about is about putting power back where it belongs in City, County and Town Halls.</p>

<p>Back in the hands of local leaders - to have a real ownership over the issues which matter. Housing. Planning. Health and public services.</p>

<p>I am not advocating some kind of Back to the Future municipal power.</p>

<p>We need to go even further - “Chamberlain plus” by also empowering communities and individuals. Enabling them to solve their own problems. Offering a reason to get involved and make a difference to civic life.</p>

<p>We are giving cities back their political freedom - their ability to decide for themselves what they want.</p>

<p>So, for example, all councils will now have this power of general competence - the ability to do what ever they want in the interests of local people.</p>

<p>Major cities can go even further and decide for themselves whether they want to go for the leadership of a Mayor.</p>

<p>There is a reason why almost every major city in the world has a strong and powerful executive leader.</p>

<p>What works for Chicago could work for Coventry. What works for Lisbon could work for Leicester.</p>

<p>We’re also forging a new democratic settlement for London.</p>

<p>So that the Mayor has the powers to match his international profile.</p>

<p>And so that Londoners have real influence over the decisions which affect their lives.</p>

<p>Like regeneration, housing investment and the Olympic legacy.</p>

<p>These decisions are being wrested away from quangos and bureaucrats and put back where they belong - in the hands of Londoners.</p>

<p>But as well as political autonomy, cities have also got to have the economic freedom to go with it.</p>

<p>What we’ve had in recent decades is completely unstable and unbalanced economic growth.</p>

<p>Some places have been left far behind - with the public sector picking up the slack; further unbalancing the local economy away from the enterprise that should be its life blood.</p>

<p>Cities are sometimes described as the engine of economic growth, all governments recognise that.</p>

<p>In furtherance of that belief, over the past decade or so, government’s well intentioned but unsteady hand has systematically poured sugar into that engine - stifling it of life.</p>

<p>You can’t create jobs around the country by coming up with a masterplan from Whitehall.</p>

<p>You can’t support businesses by drawing artificial lines on a map and calling them ‘regions’.</p>

<p>So we are putting the decisions on growth in the hands of the people who know and understand their own natural economic area - through local enterprise partnerships.</p>

<p>Local business leaders alongside local elected officials, coming together in their own ways to to devise their own solutions - without being drowned in guidance and paperwork.</p>

<p>The people of Birmingham, Cambridge or Bristol should be deciding what their economic future looks like - based on their industries, circumstances and strengths.</p>

<p>It has been encouraging to see the way that cities have responded to this opportunity. Like Sheffield - no longer forced into the box marked “Yorkshire and the Humber” and having to follow instructions from Leeds.</p>

<p>It is now working in partnership across a much more natural economic area, bringing in parts of Derbyshire and the National Park, as well as private businesses.</p>

<p>We are looking at three levers for growth.</p>

<p>First, partnerships can bid for a share of the billion and a half pound growth fund - helping to create private sector jobs and attract businesses investment.</p>

<p>Second, there is the new homes bonus for councils who want to support local families and attract new workers.</p>

<p>It will make sure that local people are rewarded, not penalised, for development in their area.</p>

<p>And third, there are the ideas we have for reforming business rates.</p>

<p>It seems crazy to me that English councils have no financial incentives to invest in economic growth.</p>

<p>We are examining ways to give authorities a real financial incentive to encourage business and a spirit of enterprise.</p>

<p>But we’re already announced plans to let councils borrow against future business rates.</p>

<p>And we are now looking at much more radical options - keeping more of the proceeds and moving towards a much greater degree of self financing.</p>

<p>But perhaps one of the biggest blockades to growth over recent decades has been the planning system.</p>

<p>Well, we call it the planning system.</p>

<p>We haven’t had proper planning in this country for decades.</p>

<p>Instead we just had development control.</p>

<p>We’ve ended up with a confrontational system, founded on mistrust and a sense of powerlessness.</p>

<p>Which dreamed up targets instead of making sure that homes got built.</p>

<p>The new planning system is predicated on encouraging growth - there will be a powerful presumption in favour of stainable development.</p>

<p>Planning will be plan led rather than the current default setting of appeal on application.</p>

<p>We are borrowing from Germany and elsewhere with our emphasis on neighbourhood planning.</p>

<p>Some people mistakenly think this is a policy which has been designed for rural villages.</p>

<p>No. Neighbourhood planning is equally applicable to the urban setting.</p>

<p>The whole point about localism is that it enables any community, where-ever it is, whatever its circumstances, to make its own choices for growth.</p>

<p>The building blocks of great cities are strong and cohesive neighbourhoods - where people have a strong sense of belonging and pride.</p>

<p>Those neighbourhoods should be able to come together and say, this is what we want our community to look like in five, ten, twenty years time.</p>

<p>Far from being a NIMBY’s charter - this is a way of giving people a reason to say ‘yes’ to growth.</p>

<p>Confident that this is their neighbourhood. Their city. And their choices about their future.</p>

<p>Through localism, I believe that we can unleash the potential which we all believe is latent in our cities.</p>

<p>We can restore their political autonomy, their economic freedom, and their financial independence.</p>

<p>If we want our cities to be able to compete on the global stage, then we have to start locally.</p>

<p>There used to be a saying: what Manchester does today, the world does tomorrow.</p>

<p>Every single city should aspire to replacing Manchester in that sentence.</p>

<p>There are few limits to their new powers.</p>

<p>There should be no limits to their ambition.</p>
