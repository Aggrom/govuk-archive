<p><em>Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version.</em></p>

<p><em>Political content has been removed.</em></p>

<p>When I was a Shadow Minister I heard your calls for Government to stop imposing additional costs on the building industry.</p>

<p>They were consistent, loud and clear.</p>

<p>I’m still hearing them now we’re in Government.</p>

<p>So I wanted to take up the NHBC’s kind invitation to come and tell you what I’m going to do to answer those calls.</p>

<h3 id="addressing-the-public-deficit">Addressing the Public Deficit</h3>

<p>I know some of you were at the Housing Market Intelligence Conference last month.</p>

<p>There I set out what I thought a better market would look like.</p>

<p>I said that we need to reduce the public deficit, provide powerful incentives to build new homes, streamline planning, and remove a whole raft of regulations.</p>

<p>These steps would put in place the conditions to get the market moving again.</p>

<p>But the first priority had to be acting swiftly to cut the public deficit.</p>

<p>I know that many had become used to feeding of a level of unsustainable public expenditure - but I am afraid it could not last.</p>

<p>No business could survive with the level of debt the Government was carrying and we had to address it as our first priority.</p>

<p>You only have to look to Ireland to see what unsustainable debt can do to a country’s economy - and a housebuilding industry.</p>

<h3 id="the-market">The Market</h3>

<p>The previous housing and planning policy was also having a dangerous impact on the market.</p>

<p>Neighbourhoods had little incentive to support growth.</p>

<p>Unattainable targets pitted communities against the very idea of building new homes.</p>

<p>The planning system worked in no one’s interests.</p>

<p>The additional regulatory costs you were forced to bear were in danger of undermining your businesses.</p>

<p>And when the recession came the market stopped working.</p>

<p>Last year fewer homes were built than in any peacetime year since 1924 and we all know that this year isn’t looking any better.</p>

<p>So we have to act quickly to get the market working again - and the New Homes Bonus will provide powerful incentives.</p>

<p>And I would urge you all to respond to that consultation.</p>

<p>But we also need to streamline the planning system and this is on its way too.</p>

<p>Look out for the Localism Bill.</p>

<p>Now we need to get busy lifting the burden of unnecessary regulation and stultifying standards - which holds back the building industry.</p>

<p>The Spending Review committed the Government to reduce the total burden of regulation on house-builders by March 2015. It’s a pledge.</p>

<p>That means action - not words.</p>

<p>So I wanted to come here today to set how we will act to rip up the red tape that restricts your business.</p>

<h3 id="building-regulations">Building Regulations</h3>

<p>We are determined to get Building Regs right by reviewing their content with you.</p>

<p>You told us about the changes you think need to be made.</p>

<p>And the feedback we’ve had so far tells us that, whilst Building Regs might not be perfect, there is no need for a major revamp.</p>

<p>I agree - Building Regs are the bedrock. They are the right mechanism to set national minimum standards, and should remain to make sure buildings are safe, and sustainable.</p>

<p>If something ain’t broke don’t fix it - we get that.</p>

<p>My colleague, Andrew Stunell will announce the results of the review soon. There are opportunities for deregulation, as well as key areas for review and possible change in 2013.</p>

<h3 id="new-local-standards-framework">New Local Standards Framework</h3>

<p>But as you well know, Building Regs are only part of a plethora of additional standards and codes.</p>

<p>And they come with a range of bureaucratic assessment regimes dictated by central Government, various quangos, agencies and advisory bodies. They’re sometimes even in conflict with each other.</p>

<p>So today I want to kick off a process for working out how I can help you by further deregulating and de-cluttering.<br>
To make things simple and less of a burden on your business.</p>

<p>I want to introduce the new idea of a “local standards framework” - an idea that will simplify and unify all of the standards.</p>

<p>The principle is that a framework will be a defined menu of technically robust costed standards from which local authorities or neighbourhoods would choose - if they want to set additional standards in their local area.</p>

<p>The “framework” will help people make the right choices at the local level.</p>

<p>I can almost hear you thinking - so what’s going to be in the framework?</p>

<p>But I’m afraid I can’t tell you that - for one simple reason.</p>

<p>I don’t know!</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because that will be up to you to work out.</p>

<h3 id="developing-the-local-standards-framework">Developing the Local Standards Framework</h3>

<p>I want the Local Standards Framework to be developed by you - the broad church represented in this room today.</p>

<p>I don’t think central Government should determine what the standards specify.</p>

<p>In the spirit of decentralisation I want to ask you to help sort out the mess and to take a leading role in the development of the ‘local standards framework’.</p>

<p>You are the people who know most about the impact of regulations and codes. So who better to ask to help deliver a better system?</p>

<p>I am certain you will stress the need to make sure any options proposed don’t impose unrealistic burdens.</p>

<p>Burdens that could lead to fewer homes getting built.</p>

<p>If it’s going to work the Framework will need to be developed, owned and maintained by those who will use it so we will want to involve local government as well.</p>

<p>The NHBC have offered to help and I am grateful for that and I think others in the industry should also get involved.</p>

<p>Government will play our role in helping - so I’m asking my officials to help you develop the idea and later, to make the Framework bite I think it should be part of planning policy, to make it happen.</p>

<h3 id="ripping-up-red-tape">Ripping Up Red Tape</h3>

<p>Now I can hear you muttering - that is all well and good but we need action now.</p>

<p>Well, this Government is trying to do what it says:</p>

<p>We said we’d cut the public deficit - we are.</p>

<p>We said we’d cull the quangos - we have.</p>

<p>We said we’d get rid of HIPs - we did.</p>

<p>And I can announce today that the HCA will not implement the new standards they have been working on.</p>

<p>For the meantime the HCA will continue to use existing standards.</p>

<p>This will save an average increase in build costs of £8,000 per unit.</p>

<p>In the long run, the standards that apply to private and public housing should be exactly the same. My ambition is to harmonise standards at the earliest opportunity - I just don’t understand why all homes shouldn’t be the same great standard.</p>

<p>I am also removing all centrally-imposed standards for houses built on surplus central government land.</p>

<p>Right - so that’s a start made in ripping up the red tape.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Now it’s over to you to propose some more.</p>

<p>Yesterday I encouraged council leaders to seek out and destroy red tape that held them back - now I want you to do the same.</p>

<p>So, today, I’ve sent out a call for action - asking for your help in identifying other bits of red tape that I can rip up.</p>

<p>Obviously we’ve just been through a review of Building Regulations, so there is no need to repeat your views on those.</p>

<p>But any red tape that impacts on development viability (be it national, local, voluntary, site-specific, or a general business requirement) is fair game.</p>

<p>I am asking you to send me your list by the end of December.</p>

<p>As with your proper Christmas lists, the more specific you can be the better.</p>

<p>But I’m sorry that Santa won’t be able to sort out anything on the lists of regulations by Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>There won’t be enough time to get the elves to work.</p>

<p>But I’m making an early new year’s resolution that I’ll spend next year ripping up regulation - why not join me?</p>
