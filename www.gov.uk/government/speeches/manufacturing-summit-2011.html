<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Good morning, it’s a real pleasure to join you for today’s Manufacturing Summit.   </p>

<p>Despite what some people think, the UK remains one of the world’s leading manufacturing nations. Industry generates £140bn a year to the economy, and it accounts for 55% of the UK’s total exports.   </p>

<p>But in recent years there has not been the long-term planning across Government that’s needed, if we are to support UK manufacturers to compete in the global marketplace.   </p>

<p>So last year we launched the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Review, which is a root-and-branch analysis of the barriers to growth, and the structural reforms needed to encourage a balanced, sustainable economy.   </p>

<p>We have already taken positive action to help industry - with lower and simpler corporate taxes; a crackdown on unnecessary red tape; and a deal with the banks to boost access to finance.   </p>

<p>We have also taken some crucial early decisions which will support UK manufacturers.   </p>

<p>First, we are seeking to accelerate the commercialisation of new technologies, by investing £200 million in Technology and Innovation Centres.   </p>

<p>Second, we are boosting competitiveness with new funding for the Manufacturing Advisory Service   </p>

<p>And third, we are backing SMEs looking to export more, by setting up an Export Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme, which will underwrite finance worth up to £1 million for individual small firms.</p>

<h2 id="why-industrys-image-matters">Why industry’s image matters</h2>

<p>But today I want to focus on another crucial factor that, alongside investment capital, will underpin industrial competitiveness - namely human capital.   </p>

<p>There are two issues here. The first is tackling head-on the outdated perceptions of what modern industry means. The second is ensuring we equip people with the skills that business requires, and which they’ll need, to forge a successful career.   </p>

<p>Changing people’s negative perceptions really matters. It is essential if we are to rebalance the economy, and if industry is to be able to recruit the skilled workforce it needs.   </p>

<p>Take the need for graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Around 43% of those who graduated in 2009, did so with a first degree in a STEM subject - yet just 5% went to work in manufacturing.   </p>

<p>In other words, many young people who have the potential skills industry needs, are going elsewhere. They don’t see their careers in engineering or manufacturing.   </p>

<p>Clearly much needs to be done to change their perceptions; to fire up their imaginations and make sure they know about the dynamic, rewarding careers widely available in industry.</p>

<h2 id="uk-manufacturing-success">UK Manufacturing success</h2>

<p>One of the many myths that has been allowed to go unchallenged in recent years, is the corrosive notion that manufacturing is irrelevant to our economy; that Britain is no longer a nation which makes things.   </p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. The UK is producing a wide range of cutting-edge products, in businesses across the country. Let me offer some examples: </p>

<ul>
<li>Alexander Dennis, based in Falkirk, is the leading supplier of low-carbon buses, in Europe. </li>
  <li>Aircraft ejection seats engineered by Martin-Baker in Buckinghamshire meet the toughest safety standards - and have saved nearly 7,300 lives in 93 air forces around the world. </li>
  <li>Concrete Canvas, based in Pontypridd, South Wales, has developed a revolutionary product called Concrete Cloth - it can be laid like carpet, but hardens when water is added to create a concrete surface. It is now being sold around the world.</li>
  <li>Swann Morton in Sheffield designs high quality surgical blades and scalpels and exports to over 100 countries.</li>
  <li>SSTL, based in Surrey, is the world’s leading maker of small satellites used to map and monitor civil emergencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the many innovative UK manufacturers leading the way in new sectors, developing frontier technologies and finishing ahead of fierce global competition.   </p>

<p>So what’s needed now is to spell out that British design, engineering and manufacturing are world-class. </p>

<h2 id="showcasing-manufacturing-careers">Showcasing manufacturing careers</h2>

<p>That’s why my department is hosting a series of exhibitions promoting UK firms and their products.   </p>

<p>Among other things, we have already exhibited a zero-carbon motorbike, and Airbus wing components made out of composites. In the coming months we will be showcasing many more ground-breaking products.   </p>

<p>In addition, we recently announced plans for a week of factory ‘open days’ right across the country, to help redefine manufacturing’s public image and raise its profile.   </p>

<p>By throwing open their doors to young people, innovative industrialists will help inspire the next generation of talent to see manufacturing and engineering as exciting career choices.</p>

<h2 id="salaries">Salaries</h2>

<p>And we can do that in part, by nailing the myth about low salaries being the norm in industry. There is a common misconception that engineers are poorly paid when compared to other popular choices, such as accounting or the City. In fact, skilled engineers enjoy comparable levels of pay.   </p>

<p>According to the Office for National Statistics, the median salary for professional engineers is just over £36,000 a year - that is in the top 30% of UK salaries, and 40% above the median national salary.   </p>

<p>And as their careers progress, experienced engineers can expect to rise even higher up the income scale. Last year, the median annual salary for an experienced chartered engineer was £55,000 - that’s in the top 10% of UK wages.   </p>

<p>But young people just don’t know this. So we - Government and industry - need to spell out to them that if they are looking for a well-paid, skilled job with good prospects, manufacturing and engineering offer a wealth of opportunities.   </p>

<p>We intend to do a lot more work to get this message out in the future. We are developing a range of ideas as part of the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Review, and we expect to publish proposals alongside the Budget later this month. And we would welcome your views.   </p>

<p>Of course, it’s not just a question of attracting young people into the sector. Once they have started, industry must ensure they get the training they need so their careers can flourish.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>So we are transforming the skills and further education system in order that industry can meet that demand.   </p>

<p>We are setting further education colleges free from bureaucratic control by Whitehall. We want to ensure they support economic growth by responding to the needs of employers and learners - and not the whims of politicians and bureaucrats.   </p>

<p>Our aim is to empower employers to shape the skills system, not just advise on how it should look.   </p>

<p>We are also committed to creating a new generation of University Technical Colleges. Students with technical aptitude should have the option of starting vocational training from the age of 14, alongside their core academic education.   </p>

<p>There is substantial demand for these institutions from businesses and communities, who are enthusiastic about the benefits they would bring. We intend to meet that demand.   </p>

<p>And we are increasing funding for adult Apprenticeships by up to £250 million by the end of the Spending Review period, creating up to 75,000 more places per year than the previous Government.   </p>

<p>This expansion could not take place without the commitment and far-sightedness of employers. But we want to see more employers recognise the value that apprentices add to the business - and that’s why we are making funding available to allow numbers to grow over the next few years.   </p>

<p>In future, a larger proportion of funding will be aimed at SMEs, so quality workforce training is an affordable option for more of them. That’s a real boon for the many innovative small firms in the manufacturing sector that rely on having the right skills available in the workplace at the right time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s important we get this right - so we can ensure that a reinvigorated manufacturing sector is, once again, at the heart of a strong and balanced economy in the UK.   </p>

<p>That’s why we are cutting business taxes and red tape; backing new technologies; bolstering our industrial competitiveness; and extending support for exports.   </p>

<p>And it is also why we intend to transform the industry’s image so that it can recruit the people it needs, with the skills that it needs.   </p>

<p>It won’t be an easy task. But it is vital we tackle it now, so the wealth of career opportunities available in manufacturing once again attracts Britain’s brightest and best.   </p>

<p>I believe that if we each play our part - Government and industry - we will enable our country’s industrial potential to finally be fulfilled.   </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
