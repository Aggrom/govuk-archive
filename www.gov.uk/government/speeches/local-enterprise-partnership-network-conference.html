<p><em>Transcript of the speech as delivered.</em></p>

<p>First, thank you to David and the Network for the work they’ve done in the past year.</p>

<p>It’s great to be here.</p>

<p>We’re here in Royal Mint Court.</p>

<p>But it’s a pity the money isn’t here.</p>

<p>Actually, the Cabinet went on a visit to the actual Mint in Wales where we watched them mint coins for the Olympics.</p>

<p>They told us that normally they would check our pockets for change in case we planned to walk off with any Olympics coins!</p>

<p>But since we were the Cabinet they’d let us off.</p>

<p>Well, if anyone would like a few Olympics coins I’m ready to cut a reasonable deal!</p>

<p>Now the health of the economy, just like the health of the body depends on good circulation. I know that Bob in his presentation this morning set out the scale of the challenge.</p>

<p>For our currency it must flow to every corner of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>As that great Elizabethan Sir Francis Bacon once said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Money is like muck, not good except it be spread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means giving local areas the means to prosper.</p>

<p>We used to be good at this in days gone by.</p>

<p>The industrial revolution was forged, not in the corridors of Whitehall, but the crucible of our local communities.</p>

<p>Arkwright’s first cotton mill in Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Spinning and textiles in Lancashire.</p>

<p>Iron in Shropshire.</p>

<p>What a great time it must have been with those pioneers.</p>

<p>An age where competition between local areas sparked ideas and imagination.</p>

<p>Shaping and remaking our country into the world’s workshop.</p>

<p>But over the past hundred years or so we’ve seen Big Government in revolt (or revolting Big Government).</p>

<p>The dead hand clawing back power and resource from any innovation that moved.</p>

<p>Government following after Government but the computer still saying no.</p>

<p>The vast barrier of bureaucracy blocking up the system.</p>

<p>So with local enterprise partnerships we’ve gone back to first principles.</p>

<p>Giving localities a real stake in the performance of their own economies.</p>

<p>Creating self-sustaining economies with local led growth.</p>

<p>Working hand in glove with the private sector.</p>

<p>Giving back not just political but economic power to local people.</p>

<p>You can see where local enterprise partnerships fit into the picture.</p>

<p>In a way, you’re leading the charge.</p>

<p>So two years on from your creation what’s happened?</p>

<p>From what I can see - plenty.</p>

<p>You’ve seized the initiative and demonstrated local leadership over the Growing Places Fund.</p>

<p>That’s where we’d like the future to be.</p>

<p>The way these decisions used to be made was through civil servants and scoring systems.</p>

<p>Ministers made decisions at the end of the process.</p>

<p>Now we’re saying there’s a better way of doing it.</p>

<p>We’re giving you the power to get on with the job.</p>

<p>To put money into local growth and local infrastructure.</p>

<p>And that’s what’s happening.</p>

<p>The Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership Board recently approved £11.5m for a range of projects that will bring a hospital, housing, offices and green spaces to the area.</p>

<p>Not to mention a new stage for Elstree Studios - which brought us <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p>

<p>In total we’re talking about 4,000 new jobs and 2,000 new homes by the time these projects are completed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the South East partnership has already identified 10 projects with planning consent to receive £33m and create 28,000 jobs and 14,000 new homes.</p>

<p>And now, over in Lancashire, they’ve approved three schemes which are ready to start work immediately.</p>

<p>And as Justine set out earlier - you know how to get the best bang for your buck.</p>

<p>In layman’s terms that means 1,550 new jobs, a further £95m investment just short of 600 new jobs.</p>

<p>I’d like to give a big hand to all those private sector lenders who’ve given their time to the enterprise cause.</p>

<p>Your efforts are paying off.</p>

<p>And what’s so encouraging is the way that different areas are spurring each other on.</p>

<p>Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership decided to encourage 100 companies to recruit 100 new apprentices in 100 days.</p>

<p>But anything they can do Leeds can do better.</p>

<p>The Leeds City Region Local Enterprise Partnership is aiming to get 1,000 companies to sign up to its 5-3-1 initiative.</p>

<p>It brings skills, education, mentoring, work placements and apprenticeships to a local area.</p>

<p>And I’ll bet there’s someone here thinking a thousand? Only a thousand? I can do better than that.</p>

<p>And, speaking as a Bradford man, I’m sure there’s even someone who can put one over on Leeds.</p>

<p>By all means do so.</p>

<p>I’ve no problem whatsoever with a bit of sibling rivalry.</p>

<p>Local people will be the winners.</p>

<p>But since we’re talking rewards let’s focus on the crown jewels.</p>

<p>I’m referring, of course, to our Enterprise Zones.</p>

<p>Nothing quite says we’re open for business than these hot houses of growth.</p>

<p>When I last looked there were 24.</p>

<p>From Hull to Hereford, Sheffield to the Solent.</p>

<p>All with simplified planning rules, and 100 per cent relief for all new firms over five years and to be kitted out with super fast broadband.</p>

<p>And these tax breaks begin the moment a business moves onto the site.</p>

<p>We’ve a zone in the Humber that could bring in more than 20,000 new jobs.</p>

<p>There’s one in Tees Valley too.</p>

<p>Helping us keep our place as a world leader in renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and digital sectors.</p>

<p>Not to mention supporting up to 1,200 jobs by 2015.</p>

<p>I could go on all day but now’s maybe not the time to pat yourselves on the back.</p>

<p>We’ve a job to do.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.</p>

<p>To go further faster we need to tear down the culture of delay in local government circles that’s paralysed action and growth.</p>

<p>As I said last time I was here, I’m fed up with local organisations waiting for my permission to act.</p>

<p>Don’t be shy.</p>

<p>Don’t put your hand up.</p>

<p>Don’t faff about.</p>

<p>Just get on with it.</p>

<p>What I’ve found particularly refreshing about our local enterprise partnerships is the way they’re getting the public sector to just get on with it.</p>

<p>Take, for example, Local Development Orders.</p>

<p>They let local authorities grant automatic planning permission for certain developments such as new industrial buildings.</p>

<p>Removing the normal delay and costs of planning permission.</p>

<p>They give firms greater certainty.</p>

<p>Now I’ve no idea why only a handful were put in place in the seven years since they’ve been in place.</p>

<p>That’s anyone’s guess.</p>

<p>Never mind.</p>

<p>Our Enterprise Zones aren’t backwards in coming forwards.</p>

<p>They’re getting stuck in.</p>

<p>Two thirds of the Zones will have at least one of these orders in place by the summer.</p>

<p>Eighteen orders have already been agreed, eight more have got through the consultation, a further 40 are in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone has a nice collection of development orders on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Six at the last count.</p>

<p>And this hub of off shore wind farms, port logistics and engineering is putting its orders to good use.</p>

<p>Turning them into new buildings, extensions, roads, telecommunications and low carbon energy installations.</p>

<p>The other day I popped in to see one of the entrepreneurial companies who are benefiting from this.</p>

<p>SeaJacks build vessels for offshore wind farms in the North Sea.</p>

<p>No idea how they do it.</p>

<p>I’m just glad they’ve got the money to get on with it.</p>

<p>A few folk think that doing things locally loses out a bit in terms of global prestige.</p>

<p>I think that’s stuff and nonsense.</p>

<p>They’re helping us gain a slice of the global pie.</p>

<p>And it’s not over egging it.</p>

<p>Look at global manufacturer X:Cel Superturn. It’s rapidly expanding its operation into the Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone bringing £18 million with it.</p>

<p>Japanese logistics firm Vantec, a subsidiary of Nissan, recently became the first overseas company to invest £24 million in an Enterprise Zone - taking advantage of Sunderland’s Enhanced Capital Allowances.</p>

<p>These examples I think prove a point.</p>

<p>That we need to give even more power to your elbow.</p>

<p>They’re about reforming business rates.</p>

<p>Allowing local areas to keep the proceeds of the wealth they create instead of handing it back to central government.</p>

<p>We’ve published the National Planning Policy Framework.</p>

<p>Development will now get the green light unless the harm outweighs the economic benefits.</p>

<p>The framework is another example of our new approach.</p>

<p>We’ve taken 1,000 pages of planning regulation down to less than 50.</p>

<p>Given planning back to the population.</p>

<p>You’ve made the point about how difficult it can be to get things done.</p>

<p>Well, we’re doing something about it.</p>

<p>Ensuring that local enterprise partnerships alongside local authorities can create decent developments.</p>

<p>Places where people can work and grow up.</p>

<p>But I am expecting to hear what’s going well and what’s getting in the way of you getting things done.</p>

<p>I understand today that you have shared stories of the good, bad and the ugly, for example: the good work that you have led to speed up planning locally.</p>

<p>Ursula (Ursula Lidbetter - Chair, Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership) - I would like to hear more about what you have done to get planners and developers to agree investment.</p>

<p>Denys (Denys Shortt - Chair, Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership) - I know that my officials - including Bob - worked with you and transport officials to unlock a key development.</p>

<p>Alex (Alex Pratt - Chair, Buckinghamshire Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership) - you have secured private sector resource to support the Buckinghamshire Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership. I would be interested in hearing what the local authorities are also doing to support you.</p>

<p>But we must go further and faster - the scale of the challenge is significant.</p>

<p>I heard today that because of local authority processes, one area took four months to procure a website.</p>

<p>It would have been cheaper and easier to have trained a pigeon!</p>

<p>Anything that takes four months to procure, tells you there is something wrong with the procurement process.</p>

<p>That it’s not fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Generally these processes are put together by people who don’t understand the problem.</p>

<p>Who are only interested in making sure nothing goes wrong.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter to them.</p>

<p>But don’t be seduced.</p>

<p>You’re here to name and shame.</p>

<p>Let me let you into a secret.</p>

<p>We took a risk when we set up the local enterprise partnerships.</p>

<p>It was against the normal way they do things from the centre.</p>

<p>And it’s basically because we didn’t want you to mimic or copy what had gone before.</p>

<p>We wanted you to bring that private sector vitality to the party.</p>

<p>To encourage local authorities to share.</p>

<p>To deliver the growth that makes a difference to our local communities.</p>

<p>I bet there are a few local organisations out there right now with their noses out of joint, uncomfortable with the way you’re pushing the boundaries.</p>

<p>I’d like to give you a considered view.</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<p>You’re clearly doing something right.</p>

<p>And if there’s anyone who is refusing to play ball and help you to help your local communities let me know.</p>

<p>For instance, if there are local authorities out there that are refusing to pool their resources to support their partnership, I’ll be expecting answers - pretty quickly.</p>

<p>So don’t be shy.</p>

<p>If you see rules break them.</p>

<p>If there are obstacles - go through them.</p>

<p>Otherwise the dead hand of Government will come up from the grave and pull you all down.</p>

<p>So take liberties.</p>

<p>Tell us what you need to make progress.</p>

<p>We all share the determination to act on behalf of our local communities, our local heartlands.</p>

<p>It’s that that will help the money flow and the economy grow to the benefit of all.</p>
