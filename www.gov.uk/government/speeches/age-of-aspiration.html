<p><em>Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version.</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Thank you to Robert Peto for your very kind introduction and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors for hosting this event this morning.</p>

<p>Last time I was here as Shadow Minister to launch a collection of my speeches.</p>

<p>Old habits die hard - in a speech last week I made the mistake of calling myself the Shadow Housing Minister.</p>

<p>As one of my staff cruelly pointed out - “Minister, you spent longer as a <strong>shadow</strong> than Cliff Richard!”</p>

<p>But I’m finally here and it’s great to be able to talk to you today on a subject I am passionate about.</p>

<p>Something that is at the heart and soul of this Government - <strong>aspiration</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="aspiration">Aspiration</h3>

<p>Now, my predecessor famously said that falling levels of home ownership were ‘not such a bad thing’.</p>

<p>I’ve asked RICS to host this event to make clear from the outset that I believe that <strong>home ownership is a very good thing</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact I will work every day to help people achieve their aspirations to own their home.</p>

<p>Of course I am not arguing that everyone should somehow aspire to home ownership.</p>

<p>Renting a home can be a positive and flexible choice.</p>

<p>And social housing provides a sense of security for millions of families.</p>

<p><strong>I am simply saying to those who aspire to own their own home -</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>This Government will support you</strong></li>
  <li><strong>You will not be ignored</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The age of aspiration is back!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are an estimated 1.4 million households who aspire to own a home but are unable to do so because of house prices and mortgage availability.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of thousands of people in rented accommodation, or living with parents, who yearn to be first time buyers.</p>

<p>It is now true that the average age of first time buyer (with no support from their family) is 37.</p>

<p>Now that 37 year old is not asking for a hand-out they just want a chance.</p>

<p>We need to give them that opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="sound-economic-management">Sound economic management</h3>

<p>The best thing we can do for the all-important First Time Buyer is to get the economy back onto a sound footing.</p>

<p>This Coalition is prepared to take the tough decisions needed to make that happen.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said yesterday that his number one priority is to deal with the country’s massive deficit.</p>

<p>As he put it; if we don’t, we run the risk of much higher interest rates. But it’s not just that they will be higher:</p>

<p>It’s that they’ll climb faster - and further - and sooner and stay high for longer -  if we don’t act immediately.</p>

<p>We’ve made a good start with over £6 billion in savings for this year. George Osborne is sending a strong signal to the markets that we’re very serious about tackling head on the huge financial challenges we face.</p>

<p>We will need to work together across the housing market - builders and surveyors, lenders and brokers, Regulators and agents - to ensure that the conditions which created the housing bubbles of the past are never repeated.</p>

<p>But there are still difficult adjustments to be made and I know that market confidence remains fragile.</p>

<p>There is a risk that the market may not respond to changing conditions quickly enough, leaving creditworthy borrowers still out in the cold.</p>

<p>I see responsible lending and responsible borrowing as two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Borrowers will need to demonstrate financial responsibility and show that they can sustain homeownership.</p>

<p>In return lenders will need to support creditworthy homeowners.  I know the housing market is still fragile but we in Government will do all we can to help.</p>

<p>We’ve already taken quick and decisive action to make HIPs history.</p>

<p>Expensive and bureaucratic Home Information Packs increased the cost and hassle of selling homes. We have ripped up red-tape that was strangling the Housing Market recovery.</p>

<p>A move that has already started to have an impact - the number of homes coming to market immediately jumping by a third.</p>

<p>The Coalition Government has also agreed to promote shared ownership schemes and help social tenants and others to own or part-own their home.</p>

<h3 id="housebuilding">Housebuilding</h3>

<p>But if we are really serious about supporting people’s aspiration for home ownership, the real prize is we must build more homes.</p>

<p>In that booklet of speeches I launched here earlier this year, I sympathised with my predecessors in this job, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ordered to deliver 3m homes by 2020 - it was just a race against time for this week’s hapless housing minister to make something … anything …happen … before the inevitable reshuffle.
&gt; “So higher targets … louder diktats … a bigger stick and more legislation to create strange sounding Quangos designed to deliver on the Government’s housing targets … RSS’s … the HCA … RDAs … EEDA … SEDA … EERA … NERA.
&gt; As the latest housing minister pulled the levers of state, he or she pushed the people further away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now, I am that Minister with my hand on the levers.</p>

<p>And I’m determined to deliver.</p>

<p>So in place of those meaningless targets - we will introduce powerful incentives.</p>

<p>In place of centralisation - I will devolve power.</p>

<p>In place of expensive Quangos - we will trust people.</p>

<p>I’m going to release those centralised levers that don’t work anyway - and as I do, I am certain an extraordinary thing will happen.</p>

<p>The more power we give away - the more people will act to generate real change.</p>

<p>For the first time incentives will create direct benefits for local communities. Bringing jobs, investment and yes - more homes for local people.</p>

<p>Rather than being told what to build and where -  residents of villages, towns and cities will be able to develop their own vision for their place.</p>

<p>We’ll introduce Local Housing Trusts. Enabling communities to create new housing for local people.</p>

<p>We understand that the transition to a more open, transparent and democratic planning system is not entirely anxiety-free for many involved.</p>

<p>But we know that there is no future in this centrally planned system which has so dramatically failed, delivering fewer homes now than during any peacetime year since 1924.</p>

<p>By unleashing the aspirations of communities as well as individuals to build homes where and when they are needed, we will bring about greater certainty.</p>

<p>Certainty that will replace the conflict caused by imposing housing numbers from right here in Whitehall.</p>

<p>Certainty that will give investors confidence to invest.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The last thing we need is a return to the house price boom and bust of recent years.</p>

<p>Falling prices are bad for homeowners and builders alike, whilst soaring prices freeze out first time buyers.</p>

<p>So, we need to build more homes and entrench sensible lending practices so that, in the long run, houses will become more affordable.</p>

<p>That’s our aim: a stable housing market that gives both home buyers and builders a solid base to invest for the future.</p>

<p>Homeownership has provided personal and financial security to millions of people in the UK, including (I am almost certain) the majority of this audience.</p>

<p>I do not believe that it is right to deny the benefits of homeownership, that we have enjoyed, to the next generation.</p>

<p>And this new Government is not in the business of pouring cold water on people’s aspirations.</p>

<p>Of course I know many analysts predict further short or medium-term falls in homeownership.</p>

<p>And given the appalling financial legacy left to us - they could be right.</p>

<p>But it is not good enough to simply say “this may be a good thing.”</p>

<p>I believe that it is human nature to aspire to shelter and security - and for the many that means owning the roof over your own head.</p>

<p>And I don’t consider it my job as Housing Minister to hold those aspirations back.</p>

<p>With a new Government and despite the enormous financial difficulties the country faces I want to state clearly today:</p>

<p>“The Age of Aspiration is back.”</p>
