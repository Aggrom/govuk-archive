<p>Minister, Generals, Madam Chair, Ambassadors, Ladies and Gentlemen, god morgen.</p>

<p>I’m delighted to be given the opportunity to speak directly to you. </p>

<p>Allowing me to stress in person, on behalf of the government of the United Kingdom, how highly we value the defence relationship between our two countries. </p>

<p>As an ex-Army officer myself, I am doubly delighted to be addressing a Norwegian Army audience. </p>

<p>My old regiment used to train in Norway and valued their experience enormously.</p>

<p>I understand how valuable private to private, officer to officer links are.</p>

<p>So I am particularly keen that our army-to-army relationship flourishes. </p>

<p>Norway is one of the United Kingdom’s closest and most important partners.</p>

<p>For the UK, Norway is the perfect ally: strategically located, reliable and highly capable.</p>

<p>Our geographical proximity and our intertwined history means we share significant cultural bonds.</p>

<p>From Harold Hardrada to Jens Christian Hauge, the Norwegians from the past who have helped shaped the Britain of today, and helped to maintain our freedom, are many. </p>

<p>We developed our constitutional monarchies and our democracies side by side.</p>

<p>This cultural similarity has led us to develop similar national values. </p>

<p>Not just constitutionally with our monarchies and democracies.</p>

<p>But in our shared respect for human rights, freedom of expression and the rule of international law. </p>

<p>These concepts are central to our foreign and defence policies.</p>

<p>We recognise that the globe is interconnected, and that we cannot live free in isolation.</p>

<p>So, when al Qaeda sheltering in Afghanistan, attacked the US, Norway and Britain answered.</p>

<p>When piracy staged from Somalia became rife, Norway and Britain answered.</p>

<p>And, when a brutal dictator was murdering his own people in Libya, Norway and Britain answered.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that, when future crises emerge, which threaten our national interests and our shared values, Norway and Britain will answer again. </p>

<p>All of this recent cooperation has taught Britain that Norway can be relied upon to contribute to international operations, and that you shoulder that burden with the utmost competence.</p>

<p>Your capabilities are world leading.</p>

<p>Your central involvement in the Libyan campaign proved this. </p>

<p>With 3000 mission hours flown and 588 bombs dropped you set a pace that Colonel Ghadaffi couldn’t keep up with. </p>

<p>These capabilities make you valuable expeditionary allies and trusted guardians of NATO’s North Eastern flank.</p>

<p>So when people ask why the UK is so interested in its defence relationship with Norway, I answer them - why wouldn’t we be?</p>

<p>I hope that the Memorandum of Understanding that our two Defence Ministers signed earlier this year has cemented our bilateral relationship, and provided an important springboard to its future development.</p>

<p>In addition to being a statement of intent, this agreement also highlights the central tenets of our view of NATO’s Smart Defence initiative. </p>

<p>The MoU talks about enhancing interoperability for joint action, coordinating resources to achieve cost-efficiency and sharing knowledge and technology.</p>

<p>In otherwords, working together and saving money.</p>

<p>In essence that is our vision. </p>

<p>For in a world of ever-shifting threats, we simply cannot predict what the next mission will be.</p>

<p>And in a world of tightened resources, we cannot afford to independently maintain all capabilities to face all possible missions.</p>

<p>So Smart Defence is not a luxury, it is a necessity.</p>

<p>But practically, what does it mean? </p>

<p>What actual capabilities might we sensibly consider sharing? </p>

<p>Well, there is a dialogue going on between our two Ministries about this putting meat and muscle on the bone.</p>

<p>Let me give you a flavour where collaboration can enhance our combined security and should be explored.</p>

<p>The Chair of the Standing Committee mentioned our Maritime Patrol Aircraft.</p>

<p>The UK is currently looking at options to replace these. </p>

<p>It might make sense for our two nations to think about pooling resources with regards to this capability. </p>

<p>We do after all patrol some of the same area. </p>

<p>At the very least we should consider maximising interoperability.</p>

<p>Our Royal Marines currently make very good use of your winter training facilities. </p>

<p>Parts of the British Army also take advantage of the facilities and environment you are able to offer. </p>

<p>It might be that this army-to-army relationship could be developed further by expanding the British Army involvement in this training, particulalry upon the conclusion of the Afghan mission. </p>

<p>Norway and Britain both have highly trained armies.  We both understand our responsibilities to the world. </p>

<p>That is why an obvious area for joint working would be capacity building of developing nations’ armies, particularly in some of the coutries of Sub-Saharan Africa, where we have seen the instability that can arise from security vacuums.</p>

<p>To my mind capacity-building is also Smart Defence - creating the indigenous capability to prevent problems before they occur, saving lives and money in the long term.</p>

<p>I take on board the General’s reservations about the Smart Defence Initiative.  We are determined that it must, at its heart, address practical co-operation in the land domain.</p>

<p>What is true for Norwegian and British cooperation is also true for collaboration within the Northern Group.</p>

<p>This Government sees this group of committed and like-minded defence powers as central to our own plans for Smart Defence.</p>

<p>And I want to take this opportunity to thank Norway for the instrumental role it has played in providing drive and leadership within this group.</p>

<p>I believe that the Northern Group can provide a critical mass for the modernisation agenda within NATO.</p>

<p>By working within this non-institutionally bound framework we can achieve real progress and establish a model for practical cooperation and deployability that others will want to copy.</p>

<p>I also think the Northern Group can be used as a forum for sharing best practice and developing new capabilities. </p>

<p>No country has a monopoly on innovation. </p>

<p>And as we begin to contemplate our drawdown in Afghanistan, the collective memories of the Northern Group can help to maintain the tough lessons we have learned from that battle.</p>

<p>Although, we must sensibly prepare for a post-ISAF environment, we should also think about the future challenges we might be presented with. </p>

<p>Whatever operations we are involved in they are likely to require rapidly deployable capabilities.</p>

<p>It is in this area that I think the Northern Group can also take a lead. </p>

<p>European members of NATO have rightly been criticised for lacking deployable capabilities. </p>

<p>The members of the Northern Group are starting to counter this criticism with deeds. </p>

<p>By developing interoperability and allocating our defence resources in a coordinated fashion, we can ensure that Europe is better able to look after its own security needs and take the lead in operations in our sphere of interest.</p>

<p>In this way, the Northern Group strengthens NATO just as the leading group in a cycle race spurs on the rest of the chasing pack to catch up.</p>

<p>In the future I believe the Northern Group will be central to building coalitions of not just the willing, but also the able.</p>

<p>This aspiration means that the forces of the future must be dynamic and flexible, even if they will possibly be smaller.</p>

<p>And that brings me onto my next topic, the UK’s plans to modernise its armed forces - a project we call Future Force 2020. </p>

<p>And because this is an army conference I will go into a bit more detail on the army specific elements of this - or Army 2020 as we refer to it.</p>

<p>The UK’s 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review set out the blueprint for our Future Force 2020. </p>

<p>It analysed the threats that the UK may face in the future and considered how our military would need to be structured to deal with those threats.</p>

<p>It determined that the UK’s future forces would need to be agile and interoperable across services and with allies.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, however, it also concluded that those forces and the equipment they used would have to be sustainable - in personnel terms, but also in funding terms.</p>

<p>I am pleased to be able to say, that after some very hard decisions, we have now achieved a balanced equipment budget.</p>

<p>That means we can manitain and with confidence, the powerful, adaptable and agile Armed Forces that our national security demands.  And that our role in the international community requires.</p>

<p>Within that, Army 2020 is the blueprint for our new Army. </p>

<p>It will deliver a new structure designed to meet the needs of a smaller, but more flexible Army.</p>

<p>Well trained, well equipped, and crucially, fully funded.</p>

<p>Clearly, a smaller Army will necessitate some changes in structure, and some units will be merging. </p>

<p>But we have done everything we can to maintain the Army’s traditions and sense of its own history.</p>

<p>And we will remain one of the very few countries able to deploy and maintain a brigade-sized force almost anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The key elements of this new structure are the Reaction and Adaptable Forces. </p>

<p>The Reaction Forces will comprise three Armoured Infantry Brigades and 16 Air Assault Brigade, trained and equipped to undertake the full spectrum of intervention tasks. </p>

<p>They will also be responsible for generating a Lead Armoured Infantry Battlegroup and Lead Air Assault Group, capable of undertaking short notice contingency tasks. </p>

<p>Given the high readiness nature of the Reaction Force, it will comprise mainly Regular Forces with approximately 10 per cent coming from the Reserve Force.</p>

<p>Reserve Forces will play a more important role across our Future Forces.</p>

<p>Over the last decade some 25,000 members of the reserve have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, including over 18,000 members of the Territorial Army.</p>

<p>We intend to integrate Reserve Forces more fully into our Regular structures, growing Reserve capabilities and investing an additional £1.8bn in over the next ten years. </p>

<p>All of these changes will take time to implement. </p>

<p>At the end of the process we will have a leaner and formidable Army. </p>

<p>We have maintained the ability to act unilaterally, but we also intend, as a matter of priority, to seek opportunities to work with the Norwegian Army and other partners, particulalrly in the areas of training, capability development and resource sharing.</p>

<p>In conlcusion let me say this.</p>

<p>Norway has been a steadfast ally to the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>Brothers in arms on the ground in Afghanistan, at sea off the Horn of Africa and in the air over Libya.</p>

<p>Trust is at the centre of all strong alliances, and Norway has demonstrated time and time again that it is more than worthy of our trust.</p>

<p>The UK hopes to continue to repay that.</p>

<p>The UK sees Norway as a vital defence partner.</p>

<p>Together, and as members of the wider Northern Group, I believe we can turn Smart Defence from theory into practice.</p>

<p>And in today’s multipolar world, with unpredictable threats and unpredictable markets, it is essential that we do so.</p>

<p>Thank you. </p>
