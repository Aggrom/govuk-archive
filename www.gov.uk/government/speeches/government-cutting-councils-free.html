<p><em>Transcript of the speech as delivered.</em></p>

<p>You may have heard of the ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ - it describes how hostages held by a gang of Swedish bankrobbers back in 1973 began to sympathise with their captors.</p>

<p>It is now an accepted psychological term - and it describes how hostages can be captured not just physically but sometimes also mentally.</p>

<p>They lose track of which decisions are in their own true best interests.</p>

<p>Some of those hostages in Stockholm actually even ended up resisting rescue!</p>

<p>I think some Councils are in danger of exhibiting similar behaviour - of still looking to central government to tell them what to do.</p>

<p>And that’s what I want to talk about today.</p>

<p>But I’d like to start by thanking Westminster City Council for agreeing to host us and, of course, for definitely not being in the ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ camp, as a hostage of central government.</p>

<p>I am also grateful to all of you for coming to listen.</p>

<p>Though, as you’re about to hear, I want you to spend less time listening to me and more time listening to your residents!</p>

<h3 id="decentralising-power">Decentralising power</h3>

<p>This Government wants to set you free - to break the topdown chain of command.</p>

<p>In education, health, planning, housing and policing we are decentralising power like never before - letting people take control.</p>

<p>We are intent on creating the Big Society.</p>

<p>And to do this we must free you to do the job you actually signed up for.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine any of you decided to go into public service to be a ‘jobs worth’ - but sometimes that’s exactly what we have forced you to be.</p>

<p>It’s not your fault.</p>

<h3 id="old-role-of-local-government">Old Role of Local Government</h3>

<p>For too long central government has held local government in a strait jacket - tightly restricting your movement.</p>

<p>Making you into bean counters, and form fillers….</p>

<p>It made you inspect this, and audit that….</p>

<p>It tied you up in red tape. It stopped you from listening to your residents.</p>

<p>And that led some to make ludicrous decisions to ban things which never needed banning.</p>

<p>The papers are full of stories of people too scared to clear ice from their door steps, to organise village fetes, or to pick up litter.</p>

<p>Last week, in Dorset, a good citizen found televisions fly-tipped at the side of a road.</p>

<p>He picked them up and took them to the local recycling centre, only to be told by council officials he couldn’t leave them there as “fly-tipped waste is not legally considered household waste”.</p>

<p>People have even been fined by councils for the ‘offence’ of putting ‘domestic refuse’ in a public litter bin.</p>

<p>Sorry but this is plain bonkers.</p>

<p>We should be encouraging good behaviour.</p>

<p>We need to change attitudes and introduce common sense.</p>

<p>Councils and even our citizens have come to expect the state to be always looking over their shoulder - more Big Brother than Big Society.</p>

<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>

<p>When, in fact, the people who should be looking over your shoulders should be your residents.</p>

<p>And they would be amazed to see what you were forced to spend their money on.</p>

<p>Westminster City Council has very kindly done the maths.</p>

<p>They’re forced to spend nearly three quarters of a million pounds reporting to Whitehall each year.</p>

<p>That’s the equivalent to salaries for 26 teachers, 28 social workers or 44 street cleaners.</p>

<p>They’ve worked out that the time taken to report to Ministers in one year would take a single local government officer over 7 years of their working life.</p>

<p>And that’s not the half of it - their calculations don’t include storage costs, data quality costs, IT systems, or management costs.</p>

<p>Let alone all those returns and strategies required by law.</p>

<p>For example, the production of the Local Development Framework - itself so complex that after 5 years only 20 per cent of councils have actually managed to get them filed.</p>

<p>To help slash bureaucracy and drive down costs, residents should know how much you are spending on stuff like this.</p>

<p>And now they will…</p>

<p>Because we’re throwing open the books in Whitehall and we think you should do the same.</p>

<p>So from January all of your expenditure over £500 will be open to public scrutiny.</p>

<p>Westminster have already done so - details went on line earlier this month.</p>

<p>Residents know what salaries are being paid and what expenses are being claimed.</p>

<p>And they should do - after all it’s their money.</p>

<p>And quite frankly I still think some chief exec salaries are too high.</p>

<p>The Localism Bill will now help raise questions about those enormous top salaries.</p>

<p>Some people seem to think it’s a tougher job to run a local council than to run the country. How else could they justify being paid more than the PM?</p>

<p>In future top salaries will be voted on by the full council and they should be doing that in public.</p>

<p>And of course Ministers will continue to want to be helpful by shining a light when we think things are going wrong.</p>

<p>Today, the new force to be reckoned with is transparency, rather than Whitehall diktat.</p>

<p>And as we saw with the pay cut sensibly taken by the LGA Chief Executive just yesterday, transparency is a potent force.</p>

<p>That transparency will lead to accountability - because we know that public scrutiny is far better at making Councils take the right decisions than Whitehall targets.</p>

<h3 id="new-opportunities">New opportunities</h3>

<p>My three children come home from our local primary school with gold stars and merit badges when their headteacher thinks they’ve done something good.</p>

<p>But I shouldn’t be acting like your head teacher -  telling you to sit on the Thunder Cloud for being bad or in the Sunshine Corner when you get things right.</p>

<p>That isn’t a model for a grown-up relationship.</p>

<p>So rather than desperately seeking gold star ratings from Ministers you should be hankering after the approval of your residents.</p>

<p>Councils should no longer look up to Whitehall - you need to look out.</p>

<p>Outwards to the people you serve.</p>

<p>And this Government will give you the necessary space to do precisely that.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are abolishing Comprehensive Area Assessments and those Local Area Agreements.</li>
  <li>We have axed the National Indicator Set.</li>
  <li>So that from next year, there will be just one list of every bit of data that Government needs from you.</li>
  <li>We’re relinquishing control over nearly 5000 targets. And you can decide to ditch them or keep them - as you see fit.</li>
  <li>And rather than looking to Whitehall for their powers, local authorities will be free to act.</li>
</ul>
<p>So as long as it’s not illegal - you will be free to do it.</p>

<p>We’re calling this ‘The General Power of Competence’.</p>

<p>And to go with this power we’re giving you control over the purse strings too.</p>

<p>We’re taking more than £2bn out of the ringfence.</p>

<p>And it’ll be up to you to work with the residents in your community to decide how you will spend the money.</p>

<p>When it comes to housing, we are abolishing top down targets for building new homes and introducing a powerful incentive - the New Homes Bonus.</p>

<p>Today I can also announce the abolition of the Strategic Housing Inspections.</p>

<p>I have asked Audit Commission not to commission any new Strategic Housing Inspections.</p>

<p>Quite frankly I think they were a waste of your resident’s money - nearly one and a half million pounds of the public’s cash was going to be spent this year making you work to Whitehall’s priorities - not your residents.</p>

<p>We will also be throwing the inefficient and unfair Housing Revenue Account system in the bin.</p>

<p>This all adds up to a massive transfer of power from us to you.</p>

<h3 id="councils-response">Councils response</h3>

<p>But are councils really ready for this Town Hall revolution?</p>

<p>Some I think are.</p>

<p>Today Westminster has announced their own commitment to slash red tape - a full audit of their own regulations and burdens so they can scrap those which simply aren’t needed.</p>

<p>They’re quite literally I understand turning off the red lights.</p>

<p>Working with the police and Transport for London they’re identifying 25 sites where removing traffic lights can be done safely; improving traffic flows, and saving time and money - and helping Londoners to get about.</p>

<p>They will reduce regular inspections of local business premises. So that businesses with a track record of high standards will receive fewer audits.</p>

<p>Again, saving businesses and the Council, time and money.</p>

<p>But there are others who seem to be afraid to seize the freedom to act.</p>

<p>Their case of ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ is clearly well advanced.</p>

<p>Some are tied to Whitehall’s ‘nanny state apron strings’ terrified of being cut loose.</p>

<p>But cut loose you are.</p>

<p>You have been set free.</p>

<p>The people, your residents, rather than Whitehall, are now, officially, calling the shots.</p>

<p>And you have the opportunity to display your own entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

<p>In Government we have set ourselves a rule - if we want to introduce a new regulation we have take one out first.</p>

<p>The one in, one out rule now applies across Whitehall.</p>

<p>So today I’m suggesting you might want to adopt the same rule of thumb in your council.</p>

<p>After all I have already changed the law so you can get rid of outdated bye-laws without wasting time and money getting the Secretary of State’s approval.</p>

<p>It’s now up to you.</p>

<p>There are some ridiculous bye-laws that can be scrapped<br>
straight away.</p>

<p>If Gloucester City Council can now decide whether fish frying in public should be banned.</p>

<p>And if Hammersmith and Fulham really want to continue to regulate the use of Dickie straps and skidpans - well that’s their choice alone.</p>

<p>So why don’t you go through all of your byelaws - not just the ridiculous ones you won’t miss - but the one’s which stop you and your residents applying common sense.</p>

<p>Whitehall will no longer be looking over your shoulder forcing your staff to be ‘jobs worths’.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>We will shortly introduce ‘The Localism Bill’.</p>

<p>It will formally transfer responsibility to local communities to decide what happens where you live.</p>

<p>Instead of looking to me, it will require you to look to the people that you serve.</p>

<p>Indeed next time you get an invitation to come and hear what I have to say - maybe you should just reply that you are too busy listening to your residents to accept! Thank you. I promise I won’t be offended.</p>
