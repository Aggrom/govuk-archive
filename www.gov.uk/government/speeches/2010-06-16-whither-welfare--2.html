<p>Thank you General Fry, and good morning.</p>

<p>This is my second speech in a week to a RUSI audience. </p>

<p>Last week, I spoke at the Land Warfare Conference. </p>

<p>This week, it’s the ‘Whither Welfare’ conference.</p>

<p>I took the precaution of looking at RUSI’s programme for next week. </p>

<p>But I suspect that, and I quote, ‘The Great Power Struggle in East Asia, 1944 – 1950’, will thrive without the Robathan touch..! </p>

<p>I am pleased to speak at this important conference as the new Defence Minister responsible for Service personnel.   </p>

<p>The first duty of government is the Defence of the Realm, and we have a moral responsibility to look after those in our Armed Forces, particularly when they are prepared to risk life and limb on our behalf. </p>

<p>As the Prime Minister said in Afghanistan last week, we want to create an atmosphere in which we, as a nation, “back, revere, and support our military.”</p>

<p>There has actually never been a formal document setting out precisely what this means.</p>

<p>And that’s why, for the first time, this government will create a Tri-Service Military Covenant. </p>

<p>The Prime Minister is passionate about this. </p>

<p>It will be the foundation of the new government’s far-reaching strategy for – and obligations to – our Service men and women, their families, and former Service personnel. </p>

<p>It’s long overdue. </p>

<p>And specific policy measures are already flowing from this – for example, last week’s doubling of the Operational Allowance, though it hasn’t attracted the coverage I wish it had. </p>

<p>More broadly, we will ensure that the Armed Forces have the support they need, and that former Service personnel and their families are treated with the dignity they deserve. </p>

<p>For example, we will ensure that entitled Service personnel’s rest and recuperation periods can be maximised. </p>

<p>We will provide support for former Service personnel to study at university. </p>

<p>And we’ll ensure that injured personnel are treated in a dedicated military ward, according to clinical need. </p>

<p>But when it comes to welfare, all of us across government – not just the Ministry of Defence – have a major role to play.</p>

<p>This moral responsibility does not rest solely on government shoulders. </p>

<p>All of the organisations that you represent here today have that responsibility too, and that, I guess, is why you’re here.</p>

<p>In this country, we have developed a strong voluntary and charitable sector over many years; churches, hospitals, and schools are all good examples, if you look in history. </p>

<p>Headley Court itself, which I guess almost everyone here has visited, would not have existed without generous, charitable collections and donations.</p>

<p>We must ensure that this tradition continues by encouraging people to accept their own social responsibility for strengthening the respect between the Armed Forces and society. </p>

<p>In my view, that’s an excellent example of what we mean in the new Government by the ‘Big Society’. </p>

<p>The contribution of those who make our voluntary and charitable sectors such a success often goes unheralded.</p>

<p>So let me take this opportunity to thank all of those involved, many of them here, for their inspiration, expertise, and hard work. </p>

<p>Your help is invaluable.</p>

<p>Of course, times change, and the way we live our lives has changed swiftly as well, dramatically over the last 50 years I would suggest.
None of us is bound by these changes, but we must not be oblivious to them. </p>

<p>In medicine, for example, thanks to advances in technology and care, people who would have died in earlier conflicts are now being saved.</p>

<p>This is very welcome yet brings with it further challenges, including greater numbers of people who need expert care and rehabilitation.</p>

<p>And that places a greater emphasis on through-life support. </p>

<p>Our forces families have different expectations and needs from those of even a generation ago.</p>

<p>For instance, many more spouses and partners want and expect to work, which means the demand for childcare has increased, mirroring the rest of society. </p>

<p>And the stereotypical image of what it means to be a veteran, an ex-Serviceman, is being challenged for the first time in a generation, as the 20 or even 30 year old veterans of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan take their place in civilian society. </p>

<p>To keep up, we must focus on improving quality and collaboration, we must put people first, and we must reduce duplication of effort and red tape. </p>

<p>We should do so with some core principles in mind. </p>

<p>When the Defence Secretary spoke here on Monday, he summed up the new government’s approach to the SDSR – the Strategic Defence and Security Review – in three words: relevance, realism, and responsibility.</p>

<p>Let me concentrate on the third, responsibility. </p>

<p>It’s our responsibility, as a nation, to give full support to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces in return for the sacrifice they are prepared to make in our name.</p>

<p>Of course, life in the Armed Forces can be rewarding, and fun. </p>

<p>But our people also willingly accept the need for selfless duty – often involving dangerous operations that can result in terrible personal sacrifice – and they accept also the restrictions that Service life entails.  </p>

<p>Some of these conditions apply, of course, to their families as well. </p>

<p>But we will never forget that our people are the best weapon in our arsenal.</p>

<p>Even the most advanced technology, or bit of kit, we possess is rendered meaningless without good people.</p>

<p>We must ensure that they have what they need to do what we ask of them, and that they and their families are looked after properly during and after service.  </p>

<p>When people join the Armed Forces, they don’t cease being citizens. </p>

<p>So it really irritates me when I hear that they can’t easily open a bank account because they’re moving around, or their families can’t access their school of choice. </p>

<p>Take the issue of voter registration, which is very dear to my heart because I made a great fuss about it before the 2004/5 General Election.</p>

<p>In my view, the last government made changes to Service registration that did not benefit our Service personnel and their families. </p>

<p>Basically, there was no thought given to the impact the new arrangements would have on Armed Forces personnel. </p>

<p>We will change the rules so that Service personnel have to register only once as a Service voter on the electoral register, as long as they are a member of the Services.</p>

<p>And we will remove obstacles that may prevent Service families from registering to vote, taking account of their particular needs. </p>

<p>Regarding families, operations in Afghanistan have undoubtedly increased the stresses and strains of family life. </p>

<p>And those left behind are of course worried about those on operations.</p>

<p>But if our Service men and women are worried about issues back home – and modern communications mean this is far more likely than in years gone by – then their minds may not be fully on the job in hand. </p>

<p>And that means that there are therefore operational and moral reasons for doing all we can to support forces families. </p>

<p>And that’s why I was keen to hear the views of the Heads of the Families Federations when I met them yesterday, and they told me in clear terms what families wanted. </p>

<p>I welcomed their practical suggestions to reduce the inevitable burden that separation entails. </p>

<p>Then there is the question of special treatment. </p>

<p>Service personnel are victors not victims. </p>

<p>They are proud people who deserve more respect. </p>

<p>They are also special, and there are circumstances that demand special consideration because of their service in the Armed Forces – the injured and the bereaved are two very obvious examples.  </p>

<p>So those are the principles we should all bring to policy development: in day-to-day life – a level playing field with the rest of society; for serving their country, special treatment where and when necessary. </p>

<p>And all this is underpinned by the nation’s responsibility to those who serve their country.</p>

<p>Let me give you two examples that illustrate the breadth of the challenge and, I believe, a core part of the solution. </p>

<p>First, the challenge. </p>

<p>Can we be sure that everyone is aware of the wide range of support available – across all arms of government and, of course, the voluntary and charitable organisations?</p>

<p>We don’t need to reinvent what works perfectly well already. </p>

<p>We just need to co-ordinate and communicate it better. </p>

<p>For example, there is now a national phone number that is open to all.  </p>

<p>Our collective challenge is to ensure that no-one misses out on the services they need. </p>

<p>And second the solution which, basically, is working together. </p>

<p>Working together, means harnessing expertise at all levels. </p>

<p>It means central government departments working together (the last government used to talk about holistic government – I’m not sure it worked); central government working with local government and devolved administrations; and all working with the voluntary and charitable sectors. </p>

<p>An excellent example is the Army Recovery Capability – the ARC – which is aimed at helping those who are injured or ill to return to service, or transition to life outside the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>The MoD is contributing funding and Service personnel; Help for Heroes (and Bryn Parry’s here) will provide the capital to build Personnel Recovery Centres (which will be open to all three Services); the Royal British Legion will cover the initial running costs; and I heard from Bryn this morning that Help for Heroes will also fund courses.</p>

<p>Other Central Government Departments, and local government services, will also have a role if injured Service personnel leave the Armed Forces and require support in their local areas.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, we will ensure that we have an excellent operational welfare package. </p>

<p>We can’t promise to provide every last modern convenience. </p>

<p>But where technologies have become mainstream – for example internet access – we’ll do our level best to provide them. </p>

<p>Let me also mention those whose mental health has suffered as a result of service.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Devolved Administrations, with support from the MoD, are already undertaking community mental health pilots for former Service personnel at six NHS Trusts across the UK. </p>

<p>These arrangements make it easier to seek and access help if they have concerns about their mental health. </p>

<p>We are working closely with Combat Stress in this area, and will analyse the results closely. </p>

<p>I look forward to discussing the issues next month with Alex Neil, Minister for Housing and Communities in the Scottish Government.</p>

<p>But we will go further. </p>

<p>We are strongly committed to creating effective, through-life, mental health services for our Service and former Service personnel. </p>

<p>We want to ensure that those suffering from mental health problems are identified effectively, and as soon as possible.  </p>

<p>So we will work with experts to examine all the issues of mental health, including the practicalities and benefits of some form of screening or surveillance. </p>

<p>Whatever method we adopt we will ensure it is based on robust, scientific, clinical evidence.</p>

<p>And the Prime Minister has also asked Andrew Murrison, Member of Parliament for Westbury and a former Royal Navy Doctor, to undertake a study into the relationship between the Armed Forces (both serving and former Service personnel) and the NHS, focussing particularly on mental health. </p>

<p>This intention is for his work to be completed by the summer Parliamentary recess</p>

<p>To summarise, today this government reaffirms the moral obligation to treat those who serve, their families, and former Service personnel with fairness and dignity. </p>

<p>We will put in place a strategy – through the Covenant – to guide policy across government.</p>

<p>And we will deal with the invisible wounds of war as well as the visible ones.</p>

<p>My challenge for everyone here today, and indeed in wider society, is to find the best ways of making this happen – in full, across the nation.</p>

<p>Government and charities must work together, avoiding duplication or overlap, signing up to the principles of change and simplicity. </p>

<p>We intend to support the commitments laid out two years ago in the Service Personnel Command Paper, and build on it where it makes sense to do so.</p>

<p>Nick Harvey – the new Armed Forces Minister – and I will work to implement all the coalition agreed measures as a single programme. </p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we welcome sensible initiatives that benefit the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom or good ideas, and I welcome RUSI’s ‘Whither Welfare’ paper as the catalyst for what I hope will be useful discussion today.  </p>

<p>Our Armed Forces deserve the very best that we can provide.</p>

<p>We cannot hope to do this alone. </p>

<p>With your help, we will not fail them.</p>
