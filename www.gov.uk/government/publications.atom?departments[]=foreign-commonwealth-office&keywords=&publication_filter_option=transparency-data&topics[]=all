the work of the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (&lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;). We provide 
advice and assistance and support to British nationals travelling 
overseas. Britons make over 50 million overseas trips each year and 
although the majority of those are trouble free, if things go wrong the 
British Embassy is there to help.
The help we can provide is limited so it’s important to take as many 
precautions as possible before you travel, and to know what our 
limitations are.
Our Customer Charter sets out our commitment to providing a high level of service to you and what we ask from you in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cabinet ministers' meetings with media organisations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list sets out the Secretary of State’s meetings with senior media executives for the period May 2010-July 2011.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes all meetings with proprietors, senior executives and editors of media organisations for both newspapers and broadcast media.  It does not include those meetings with journalists that ended up in interviews that appeared in the public domain, either in newspapers and magazines.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may also exclude some larger social events at which senior media executives may have been present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the fullest possible list assembled from the Secretary of State’s Parliamentary diary, their departmental diary, personal diary and memory.  Every effort has been taken to ensure that this is as accurate as possible but the nature of such an extensive exercise means something may have inadvertently got missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
