    <title>Typhoon jets arrive at RAF Northolt for Olympics role</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time fighter planes have been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jets’ arrival marks the start of specialist training which will result in increased flying activity over London and the Home Counties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codenamed Olympic Guardian, the nine-day exercise will put airmen, soldiers and sailors through their paces in the skies over the South East. The exercise runs from 2 to 10 May, and it is likely that people will notice an increase in highly visible air activity (particularly on 5 and 6 May).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise will test the procedures military aircrews will use to intercept and communicate with aircraft breaching restricted airspace during the Olympics, and the actions they must take in response. Pilots entering restricted airspace can expect to be intercepted by Typhoon fighters or military helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air security plan for the Olympic Games builds on the Royal Air Force’s existing defence of UK airspace, which includes round-the-clock radar surveillance and Typhoon fighters held at high readiness every day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise integrates the additional forces being used to ensure the safety of the Olympics, as part of the Ministry of Defence’s role to ensure a safe and secure Games this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the Typhoon fighters which arrived at RAF Northolt today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• RAF Puma aircraft - together with Royal Navy and Army Lynx helicopters - carrying teams of RAF Regiment snipers to intercept aircraft in restricted airspace, and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• airborne surveillance aircraft including RAF E-3D Sentry aircraft and Royal Navy Sea King ASaC (Airborne Surveillance and Control) helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An RAF Typhoon arrives at RAF Northolt" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4955/Typhoon_jets_arrive_at_RAF_Northolt_for_Olympics_role-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An RAF Typhoon arrives at RAF Northolt [Picture: Senior Aircraftman Steve Buckley, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the ground, the RAF is providing additional mobile ground radar systems (Type 101 radar), while the Army is deploying air observers and high velocity and Rapier missile systems, which also provide radar detection capability, to provide additional layers of radar coverage. A final decision on the deployment of these capabilities has yet to be taken by the Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no specific threat to the Games, we have to be ready to assist in delivering a safe and secure Olympics for all to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The fact that our state-of-the-art Typhoons will be stationed at RAF Northolt underlines the commitment of the Ministry of Defence and our Armed Forces to keeping the public safe at a time when the world will be watching us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Vice-Marshal Stuart Atha, Air Component Commander for Olympics Air Security, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we undertake this essential training, there will be a visible and audible presence of RAF Typhoon and military helicopters operating above Greater London and the Home Counties. There will also be flights occurring throughout the exercise period to allow pilots and other forces to become familiar with operating in the London and Home Counties airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have sought to limit the amount of flying to the minimum required to ensure that our Forces are ready for their important role delivering air security for the Olympics, balancing this against the need for us to reduce disturbance to a minimum. But we hope that people will understand the need for this very important training, and we thank them for their continued strong support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-affairs-council-and-general-affairs-council"/>
    <title>Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, and I will attend the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-russia-summit"&gt;EU-Russia Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the EU-Russia Summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. Whilst I do not expect conclusions to be issued, we will aim to ensure that this meeting, the 30th such summit, delivers concrete results for the EU in its relationship with Russia. The discussion provides an opportunity for the UK to steer the EU’s objectives for the Summit and to ensure discussion focuses on concrete achievable outcomes, such as: resolution of the Siberian overflight charges; movement on market reform; positive developments in the energy relationship; underlining Member States’ concerns on human rights and democratic standards; and a more effective Partnership for Modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="western-balkans"&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review the situation in the countries of the Western Balkans, in advance of the discussion of EU enlargement at the GAC the following day. This will be an opportunity to consider the latest developments in the EU-facilitated dialogue between the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo: the UK welcomes the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this and is keen to see further improvement in the relations between the two sides. There may also be some discussion of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the pace of reform has recently slowed and renewed progress is badly needed, as well as consideration of the situations in Macedonia and Albania. I do not expect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a discussion on Syria. Further to a UK drive to increase EU support to Syrian civil society, I anticipate that the EEAS will present its vision on how the EU can support civil society in coping with the consequences of the ongoing conflict and better prepare it for political transition. We also expect discussion on the relationship between EU Member States and the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. Having successfully amended the EU arms embargo (and sanctions package) by setting a three-month renewal period, we will make fresh arguments in support of amending the arms embargo ahead of the March 2013 deadline in a way that offers sufficient flexibility to increase practical support to the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may also take stock of recent events in Libya, including how to support the priorities of the new Prime Minister, Ali Zidan, and his government which has now taken office. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council may discuss events in Egypt following President Mursi’s 22 November Constitutional Declaration. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but we will argue for the EU to respond appropriately to the latest developments and clearly underline support for continued progress towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the Middle East Peace Process will focus on follow-up to the 29 November UN General Assembly Resolution, including the EU’s response to the Israeli decisions to build 3,000 new housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, to unfreeze planning in the area known as E1 and to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority. EU Ministers will also discuss facilitating a rapid return to credible negotiations in order to secure a two-state solution. We will reiterate our condemnation of the Israeli decision, underlining the threat this poses to the two-state solution, and stress the need to continue work to build on the May FAC conclusions. We will also emphasise the need for the US, with the strong and active support of the EU, to do all it can in the coming weeks and months to take a decisive lead and push the peace process forward urgently. Additionally the UK will stress the need to build on the Gaza ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons. The UK will support conclusions covering these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-us"&gt;EU-US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item has been re-scheduled from November’s FAC. Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama.  I expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy and a possible EU-US free trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
We also expect Ministers to agree conclusions on Ukraine and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council"&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a substantial agenda for the GAC in December. There is a legislative deliberation on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union; a presentation by the Commission on the Annual Growth Survey; Preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December; endorsement of the 18 month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece; and a discussion on Enlargement, covering all potential candidates and including the adoption of EU Common positions for the Accession Conference with Iceland. Due to the large agenda, I expect many of these items to be brief and I expect most of the discussion to focus on the preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December and on Enlargement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statute-of-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union"&gt;Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency hopes to secure agreement on a selection method for additional judges at the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union: we have not yet received the final proposal for this.  I remain concerned at the current backlog at the General Court, which is damaging to the interests of British business.  My priorities in the discussion will be: to ensure that there is proportionate common law representation among any additional judges; that the costs of additional judges are covered within existing budgets; and that the selection method provides the Court with the stability it requires to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-semester-and-the-annual-growth-survey"&gt;European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present key elements of the 2013 annual growth survey which can be found on the Commission’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual growth survey sets out the Commission’s views on the economic priorities for Europe for 2013, focusing on fiscal consolidation, promoting economic growth and employment. The survey, which represents the first stage of the 2013 European Semester, focuses on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures across the EU.  The European Semester is the EU-wide framework for coordinating structural reforms and growth-enhancing policies. We do not expect this item to be opened for substantive discussion but, in the event that it is, I will be supporting the focus on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-for-the-december-european-council"&gt;Preparation for the December European Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the December European Council will cover: economic policy, including Economic and Monetary Union and Banking Union; defence; enlargement; and foreign policy. The last two items are covered by the separate sections of this Written Ministerial Statement on enlargement and on the Foreign Affairs Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the European Council meeting will focus on agreeing a legislative framework for Banking Union and an agenda for further Economic and Monetary integration in the Eurozone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the December European Council the Prime Minister will seek to ensure the integrity of the Single Market at 27, including in the context of the Banking Union and the European Banking Authority. We will also press for further progress on growth and ensure that the timetable for further integration in the Eurozone progresses at the right pace and in the right way.  I will argue that these concerns should be addressed prior to the December European Council so that solutions to these issues can be put to leaders on 13 and 14 December.
The December European Council agenda item on defence will pave the way for further discussion in 2013.  I will argue for a focus on developing capabilities, enhancing operational effectiveness and strengthening the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-18-month-programme-for-the-presidencies-of-ireland-lithuania-and-greece"&gt;The 18-month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAC has been asked to endorse the 18-month programme of the Council. This sets out the combined programme for the Irish, Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies of the European Council covering the period January 2013 to June 2014. I expect the programme to be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enlargement"&gt;Enlargement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will seek to agree conclusions taking stock of progress on EU enlargement, and on the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans. The Commission released their Annual Enlargement Package on 10 October.  In this communication, the Commission recommended: (i) opening accession negotiations with Macedonia; and (ii) granting Albania candidate status subject to the completion of three specific measures and evidence of continued commitment in the fight against organised crime and corruption. We believe the communication to be a broadly fair and balanced assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek conclusions reconfirming the European Council’s support for EU enlargement and recognising that the accession process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform and reinforces peace, democracy and stability. We agree with the Commission’s view that closer relations with the EU should be based on the principles of delivery on commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality, and good communication with the public. We agree that key challenges remain for most enlargement countries, including in the area of the rule of law. We also support a focus on freedom of expression and regional co-operation, particularly for the Western Balkans countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out the Government’s views on the Commission’s reports in my explanatory memorandum of 18 October. We will seek Council conclusions welcoming Croatia’s continued progress towards meeting all of its commitments in full before its expected accession on 1 July 2013, while reiterating the Commission’s call for Croatia to sharpen its focus to ensure this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will seek conclusions that provide a fair and balanced assessment of Turkey’s progress, which will inject much needed momentum into the process to allow accession negotiations to move forward in 2013. I will argue that Iceland should be commended on the progress made in accession negotiations this year, while recalling the need for Iceland to address existing obligations, such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority under the European Economic Area Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also expect the Council to welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, while calling for early progress in the area of the rule of law, in line with the new approach to accession negotiations endorsed by the Council in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the FAC discussion of 10 December, the GAC will discuss the Commission’s enlargement package for the Western Balkans countries. We remain fully supportive of a future for all of the Western Balkans countries in the EU, once conditions are met. We want the European Council to commend good progress on reform in Macedonia through the High Level Accession Dialogue, and hope the European Council will be able to build on this by agreeing to the Commission’s fourth successive recommendation to open accession negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a further report from the Commission, the December European Council will not be in a position to grant candidate status to Albania; we will want it to call on Albania to make early progress on reform implementation and establish a track record on tackling organised crime and corruption to enable a decision in 2013. I will argue for Council conclusions that underline that Serbia still needs to make real progress to deliver a “visible and sustainable improvement” in its relations with Pristina before accession negotiations can be opened, while noting that this remains in reach if recent progress continues.  We want the Council to welcome the Commission’s assessment that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo is feasible and to signal that negotiations should begin as soon as possible.  We agree with the Commission’s assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on its EU agenda has stalled. We will want the Council to press the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress and deliver quickly on those issues they themselves have agreed to, for example, on the EU road map agreed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Africa highlights risk of kidnap to British nationals in Sahel region</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds detailed how the kidnap threat to western travellers in Mali and some neighbouring areas had grown as a result of instability in the region.  He reinforced how seriously the British Government takes the threat to British nationals overseas. Foreign Office officials asked the industry to highlight the risks and consider alternative options where travellers can still find adventure, but be safe too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The British government takes the threat to British nationals overseas extremely seriously.  We urge tour operators, including rally organisers, to work with us to make sure that British nationals are fully aware of the serious risks involved in travelling to these areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The terrorist groups Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and the splinter group, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, pose the greatest kidnap threat. Since the recent coup in Mali, both groups have increased their operational reach and have proven capability to travel long distances to kidnap victims.  They have also been known to use criminal gangs to conduct attacks and pass hostages to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Attacks have taken place in Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Algeria. We also assess that they have operational reach into the north of Burkina Faso and southern Libya and I am sorry to say that the situation is likely to still get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>MOD supports 'Get Safe Online Week'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new document has been released by the Department in support of the campaign, providing guidance for staff on communicating using social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube so they don’t do or say things that bring themselves and their Service into disrepute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the awareness week, the MOD is rerunning videos from last year’s ‘Think Before You…’ campaign on our social media channels. ‘Think Before You…’ is a reminder that personal and operational security should be a primary concern and that social media merely provides a different context where sensitive details can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the Defence Staff’s (CDS’s) Strategic Communications Officer said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Social media has enabled our personnel to stay in touch with their families and their friends no matter where they are in the world. We want our men and women to embrace the use of sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube, but also want them to be aware of the risks that sharing too much information may pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You don’t always know who else is watching in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The MOD Headquarters has its own Facebook, YouTube and Twitter feeds and we see no reason to stop our personnel from tweeting or posting on their own walls. But the MOD has a responsibility to warn personnel of the risks they could be exposing themselves to, hence the launch of this new campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDS’s Strategic Communications Officer added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We do not want to scare Service personnel, families and veterans and we certainly do not want them to stop using social media. We are not here to gag people because we acknowledge the ubiquity and significant benefits that social media offers to people and the MOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of Facebook and Twitter and I use them on a regular basis. These channels are vital to communicating in a digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks to Service personnel - and potentially their families - include posting details and locations of troop movements and operational events, locations and travel details of ships or aircraft, and people’s home addresses. If inadvertently released, information such as this could give the UK’s enemies the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Get Safe Online Week’ runs from 22 to 26 October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airborne supply experts train for rapid reaction role</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of Colchester-based 13 Air Assault Support Regiment Royal Logistic Corps (13 AA Sp Regt RLC) is to supply ammunition, food, fuel and spare parts to 16 Air Assault Brigade’s Air Assault Task Force (AATF), which is ready to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice to do anything from disaster relief to war-fighting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training in Norfolk placed troops six weeks into an operation, with heavy equipment having arrived in support of an initial airborne assault. The former RAF base at Sculthorpe had been established as a logistics base to supply infantry operations 30 miles (48km) away, near Thetford, with supply depots, workshops and accommodation set up in derelict hangars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Vehicle mechanics of 7 Air Assault Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers at work during Exercise Active Chariot" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1562/Airborne_supply_experts_train_for_rapid_reaction_role2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[Picture: Corporal Obi Igbo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Alistair Hamilton said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can insert logistics troops and supplies by parachute during the early phases of an operation and build from there. As more troops and kit arrive it makes for more complex logistical challenges as the demand for supplies rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve been practising how supplies get to us, such as airborne drops from Hercules transport aircraft, how we get supplies forward using helicopters and lorries, and how we run distribution points to give the supplies to the troops that need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigging vehicles to be carried under helicopters is a key skill that troops have practised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private Michael Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rigging is all about keeping a load balanced. We do a lot of classroom work to learn the principles and practise preparing different vehicles and loads, but there’s nothing like doing it with a helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as their core logistic role the unit was tested with mock attacks on the base, including countering the threat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Hamilton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This has been good training to get all of our skills and drills right, but also to train the units we’re supporting in what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 Field Company, 7 Air Assault Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, which is responsible for maintaining the AATF’s vehicles, weapons and electronic equipment, also operated from Sculthorpe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit sent teams out to repair equipment in the field or bring it back to Sculthorpe for more complicated work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lance Corporal Tom Walker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve been given some tough repairs to do without the spares and tools there are in barracks. Our soldiering has been tested too, with guard duty in CBRN kit a new experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training was carried out in parallel with Exercise Active Eagle that tested the fieldcraft of 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, the AATF’s main infantry unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK-Italy statement on counter terrorism co-operation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Minister Terzi and Foreign Secretary Hague discussed the continued threat facing the United Kingdom and Italy from terrorism, so tragically underlined by events in Nigeria two weeks ago.  We confirmed our intention to intensify our already close co-operation and consultation in this area and agreed to establish a UK-Italy High Level Group on terrorism to oversee this work. This Group will meet at senior official level, and will look at the full range of our co-operation on counter-terrorism and related issues, including counter-kidnap, piracy, radicalisation, Yemen, Somalia and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have agreed today to pursue the following areas of joint activity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the tragic deaths of Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara in Nigeria two weeks ago, we will support further work to build regional capacity to tackle the kidnap threat posed by terrorist groups, who operate across borders and target victims regardless of nationality.  As a first step, the UK and Italy will consider how best to help strengthen Nigeria’s capacity to tackle the threat posed by terrorism, including through support to regional law enforcement and security co-ordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been at the forefront of the international effort to protect the people of Libya during their struggle for change, the UK and Italy share a common desire to help build a stable and secure future for that country. We will offer further support to the Libyan authorities to prevent terrorists from taking advantage of the proliferation of arms and fighters in Libya and the wider region following the Libyan conflict.  Identifying and understanding these threats will be essential in supporting Libya and its neighbours in their efforts to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in Yemen, we have agreed to explore joint co-operation in the policing and justice reform sector.  As progress is made by the Government of Yemen in pushing Al Qaeda out of Yemen, it is important to ensure that civilian police fill the vacuum left behind.  The UK and Italy have important experience in this area.  The challenge is significant and we will work closely with our EU and other partners to support the Yemeni Government as they train police and improve justice capacity throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Joint UK-Italian statement on hostage rescue operation in Nigeria</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi di Sant’Agata met earlier today at the informal Foreign Ministers meeting in Copenhagen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They discussed the recent hostage rescue operation in Nigeria following yesterday’s conversation between Prime Ministers Monti and Cameron.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Hague made clear that there had been a limited opportunity to secure the release of the two hostages whose lives were in imminent and growing danger.  Under these circumstances it was only possible to inform Italy once the operation was already getting underway.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Terzi expressed deep sorrow and disappointment over the tragic outcome of the operation and both ministers agreed on the urgency of sharing full information to facilitate the reconstruction and understanding of these events.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers conveyed their solidarity and sympathy for the families of Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara.  They reaffirmed that the UK and Italy will continue to work together closely in the fight against such horrific terrorism and hostage-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Kenya travel advice update</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice for Kenya.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We advise against all but essential travel to within 60km of the Somali border, to coastal areas within 150km of the Kenya-Somalia border (this includes the Lamu area), to Garissa district and to low income areas of Nairobi, including all township or slum areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kenyan authorities have alerted the public to a heightened threat from terrorist attacks in Nairobi. We believe that terrorists may be in the final stages of planning attacks. Attacks could be indiscriminate and target Kenyan institutions as well as places where expatriates and foreign travellers gather, such as hotels, shopping centres and beaches. We strongly advise British Nationals to exercise extra vigilance and caution in public places and at public events.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FCO Travel Advice is kept under constant review.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and make further updates as necessary. Further details can be found in the updated &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/kenya1"&gt;travel advice on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sir-william-patey-gave-an-exclusive-interview-to-tolo-news-tv-on-29-october"/>
    <title>Sir William Patey gave an exclusive interview to Tolo News TV on 29 October</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is obvious, the Haqqani network is behind the attacks in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan, therefore we are holding talks with Pakistan to convince Pakistani officials to take tougher action against the Haqqani network in Pakistan. We need to hold talks with Pakistani officials on ISI’s possible links with the Haqqani network. We need more cooperation to deal with this menace. The US authorities have changed their previous harsh stance towards Pakistan. What is significant is a joint war against the insurgents in the region. It is clear that there are insurgent groups in Pakistan infiltrating Afghanistan and vice versa. Instability in the region can affect both Afghanistan and Pakistan. I think the accusations against Pakistan should be assessed. Pakistan can play a key role in finding an inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan. Pakistan and Afghanistan should have a frank dialogue,” British Ambassador William Patey said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He denied commenting on the Pakistani government’s support for Haqqani network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This issue is not clear. I am not getting into the Pakistani government’s relations with the Haqqani network. Speculating about this issue could not be correct. We need confidence-building between Afghanistan and Pakistan to put and end to the activity of the Haqqani network’s insurgents in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether the UK government has evidence about Pakistan’s support for insurgents, the British ambassador said that obviously the Taleban have bases in Pakistan’s border areas, but Pakistani forces are engaged in battles with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: “Pakistanis say they do not have full control over some areas in Pakistan’s tribal belt. They are fighting insurgents there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to why the NATO forces are not taking action against insurgents on the other side of the border [in Pakistan] William Patey said that they have carried out some joint raids against specific targets [in Pakistan].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It will not be a good idea to get engaged in fighting with Pakistan. I don’t think such a move could resolve the Afghan issue. Terrorists have bases not only in Pakistan, but they are also operating and have bases in Afghanistan. I do not rule out insurgents’ presence on both sides of the border. There is no disagreement on joint cooperation and fighting terrorists’ networks in the region,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touching on the issue of a possible US military operation inside Pakistan, the British envoy said that the British forces would not take part in any possible unilateral US military action against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about his stance about the Afghan president’s remarks on backing Pakistan if it were attacked by the US, William Patey said that the Afghan president’s remarks conveys a message to Pakistan that Afghanistan’s strategic agreement with the US should not be regarded as a threat against Pakistan.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Afghan peace talks&lt;br&gt;
**The UK envoy supported the Afghan president’s stance on holding peace talks with the Pakistani government rather than with the Taleban, after the assassination of the chairman of the Afghan High Peace Council, Borhanoddin Rabbani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: “The Afghan president sent a signal to the Taleban, after Rabbani’s assassination, telling them that government is no more willing to hold talks with them, unless they are fully ready. Wars end through dialogue.”&lt;br&gt;
He went on to say that they had contacts with the Taleban members coordinated with the Afghan government in order to ensure stability in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have had interactions with Mullah Zaeef [former Taleban ambassador to Pakistan]. Mullah Zaeef and a publisher of his book were in London. On his visit to London, we prepared the ground for a meeting between Mullah Zaeef and some officials. I met Mullah Zaeef in London. We sent messages to the Taleban, telling them that we are ready for talks with them,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Second Bonn conference on Afghanistan&lt;br&gt;
**William Patey expressed optimism about the upcoming second Bonn Conference on Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will reiterate our commitments to support the Afghan government and the Afghan forces after 2014 at the Bonn conference. Our objective at the Bonn conference is to show that the end of our combat mission and departure of our forces from Afghanistan in 2014 is not an end of all our missions in Afghanistan - we will only change the method of our cooperation with Afghanistan. We will continue our training role in Afghanistan after our troops’ drawdown. We will remain in Afghanistan to support and improve Afghanistan’s education, health care and governance sectors.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Corruption in Afghan government&lt;br&gt;
**The British ambassador called for joint struggle against corruption in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some decisions of the Kabul conference, including spending international aid through the Afghan government have not been successfully implemented, because of Afghanistan’s poor financial system and the Kabul Bank crisis. The British government also did not provide financial aid directly to the Afghan government,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that the government had made progress in resolving the Kabul Bank crisis, preparing the ground for the IMF to resume its aid to Afghanistan. Touching on corruption in the Afghan government the British ambassador said that the Afghan government should fulfill its commitments made at the Kabul international conference, on tackling corruption in the government institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are also cooperating with the Afghan government in fighting corruption. It is a bilateral process,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**British-Afghan strategic agreement and British troops’ role in Afghanistan&lt;br&gt;
**Asked whether Britain is willing to sign a strategic agreement with Afghanistan, Willian Patey said that they were negotiating with the Afghan government a long-term strategic cooperation agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are close to reaching agreement. Such agreement would give confidence to the Afghan people that we are not leaving them,” he answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that the British government has decided to reduce the number of British forces in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have had 10,000 British troops here cooperating with the Afghan people over the past ten years. We will commence reducing the number of our forces - their gradual departure will begin this year. The UK prime minister has announced that they will pull out 400 soldiers this year and 500 soldiers in the coming year. No British combat troops will remain Afghanistan after 2014,” the British ambassador said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He denied a WikiLeaks’ report about the Afghan president’s criticism of British forces in Sangin District of southern Helmand Province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: “The Afghan president has not shared such a thing with me, but the Afghan president has told me that British forces were able to stabilize the areas under their control in Helmand. We did not have a sufficient number of soldiers in Helmand, therefore US army units were deployed in some parts of Helmand Province. It is a joint mission. You cannot say the American forces are better than the British troops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of a British military commanders’ peace deal with the Taleban in Musa Qala District of Helmand Province three years ago, William Patey said that such things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: “We did not have enough troops in Musa Qala to stabilize the area. We have increased the number of our troops in Helmand now, broadening our cooperation with the Afghan forces. The points you raised about Musa Qala is a three-year-old story. The improvements in Helmand are the result of our joint efforts in cooperation with the Afghans.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Poppy cultivation in Helmand&lt;br&gt;
**The British ambassador said that presence of British troops in Helmand has nothing to do with the rising poppy cultivation in that province. He added that it is a joint challenge facing the Afghan government and international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You should judge differently, you should take our efforts in preventing poppy cultivation over the past years into consideration. It is not an easy task to eradicate poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. The Taleban are deliberately supporting poppy cultivation in Afghanistan in order to fund their war against our forces and the government of Afghanistan,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that the Afghans should themselves deal and resolve their challenges that are part of the legacy of three decades of war.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Office Minister hosts first ever UK-Vietnam strategic dialogue</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministers shared their views on global and regional security developments, including EU ASEAN relations, the South China Sea and the Arab Spring, as well as defence and organised international crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Dialogue, the Foreign Office Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I visited Vietnam earlier this year, I was struck by its energy, drive and rapid development. This is a fast-growing economy and one that is expected to grow by more than seven per cent a year by 2015. I want this same energy to be brought to the UK-Vietnam relationship, so that it can develop and thrive in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Vietnam is an important partner for the UK on commercial issues and, increasingly, on global and regional issues. This is what the meeting today is focusing on and I hope that through our discussions we will find more ways of working together and more opportunities for both of our countries.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time a Strategic Dialogue has been held between the two countries, and marks a new commitment to strengthen bilateral relationships following the Strategic Partnership Agreement  signed in September 2010. Other aspects of strengthened bilateral relations under the Strategic Partnership include an MoU signed on 25 October between the UK’s Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) and the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam (DAV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Dialogue comes at a time when the UK and Vietnam are already working closely on a range of long-term issues including climate change, development and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of investing in Vietnam is also becoming more widespread amongst UK businesses, with a recent survey by UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) showing that Vietnam is the second most popular investment destination, after China, in terms of emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full text of the communique:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FCO Minister of State Jeremy Browne and MOFA Vice Minister Bui Thanh Son, accompanied by senior officials from the UK Ministry of Defence and the Home Office and the Vietnamese Ministries of National Defence and Public Security, conducted the inaugural Vietnam-UK Strategic Dialogue meeting in London on 26 October 2011.  This realised the commitment made by the two governments in the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in September 2010. The Strategic Dialogue encompassed discussions on bilateral issues, including defence, organised crime and counter terrorism, as well as regional security. The Strategic Dialogue came the week before the fifth meeting in Hanoi of the UK-Vietnam Joint Economic and Trade Committee chaired by the UK Minister of Business, Innovation and Skills and the Vietnam Minister of Industry and Trade, which both parties hoped would help to further develop and deepen economic and commercial ties.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides noted with satisfaction that bilateral relations continue to be strengthened and broadened effectively in 7 areas mentioned in the Strategic Partnership Agreement. In this regard Vietnam reaffirmed its intention to proceed with a proactive and deeper international integration policy. Elevating bilateral relations with the UK through the Strategic Partnership was an important element of this policy. The UK welcomed Vietnam’s intention and also reaffirmed its own commitment to broadening and deepening its relations with Vietnam and the Asia Pacific as a whole. The UK underlined its commitment to further support work in Vietnam on good governance, accountability, transparency and human rights. In order to further enhance the bilateral Strategic Partnership, the UK warmly welcomes the official visit to the UK by the Chairman of the Vietnam National Assembly in early December 2011. Vietnam reiterated PM Nguyen Tan Dung’s invitation to PM David Cameron to make an official visit to Vietnam.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On regional security, Minister of State Jeremy Browne noted the important and growing role that ASEAN and other ASEAN-led regional mechanisms had to play and welcomed the catalytic role that Vietnam had played during its Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2010. The UK looked forward to signing the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Vietnam welcomed the UK’s signal of its intent and agreed to actively support an EU role in the region.  The two sides also discussed the situation in the South China Sea/East Sea. Both sides acknowledged that the maintenance of peace, stability, safety, and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea/East Sea is in the common interests of the international community. The UK was concerned by tensions in this vital global trade artery and expressed its hope that all parties can resolve all territorial disputes in the South China Sea/East Sea peacefully, in line with international law. The two sides reaffirmed the importance of the 2002 ASEAN - China Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea/East Sea and encouraged the parties to reach an agreement on a code of conduct. The two sides also exchanged understandings on broader geopolitical dynamics of economic power and security.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On defence, the two sides shared views and concerns over existing conflicts and emerging threats and discussed international and multilateral responses and how the two nations could cooperate more closely to minimise threats. The UK welcomed Vietnam’s potential future contribution to UN Peacekeeping Operations. On the bilateral front, the Ministers looked forward to closer defence cooperation, including more frequent exchange of delegations and the signing of an MoU on defence cooperation. Counter-proliferation, nuclear security and other non-traditional security challenges were discussed, with both sides strongly reaffirming the importance of countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which would destabilise global peace and security. Both sides underlined the importance of making tangible progress on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation to fulfil the commitments set out in the 2010 NPT Action Plan, towards our shared long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons. The two sides also reiterated the importance of preventing nuclear material and know-how falling into the hands of terrorists. The UK and Vietnam agreed to cooperate on a range of international initiatives such as the Nuclear Security Summit and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Vietnam informed of the steps taken to sign and ratify the amended Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The UK also committed to working with Vietnam to develop civil nuclear capacity in pursuit of the legitimate development of clean energy to support its impressive economic growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On international organised crime and counter terrorism, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to working together to counter these global threats. The UK welcomes the participation of Vietnam in the London Cyber conference due to take place in early November. Other forms of organised crime including human trafficking and money laundering were also discussed, with both Ministers welcoming the existing cooperation between their two countries and looking forward to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on immigration information exchange. The UK and Vietnam also discussed the UN Convention against Trans-national Organised Crime and the Palermo Protocols on human trafficking and people smuggling. In closing, the two Ministers agreed that Security and Defence would remain a key pillar of the Strategic Partnership and looked forward to ever closer dialogue in the coming months in the spirit of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary welcomes EU sanctions following assassination plot in the US</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking today he said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome the EU’s agreement to impose restrictive measures on five individuals following the disrupted plot  to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to  the US.  The EU action follows the UK’s designations earlier this week under the Terrorist Asset Freezing Act 2010.  The EU measures will impose  an EU-wide financial assets freeze and prevent any funds being made available to the individuals concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The assassination plot appears to constitute a escalation in Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism outside its borders.  This coordinated EU action sends a strong message that EU Member States will not tolerate Iranian involvement in terrorism and underlines both the gravity of the plot, and the serious consequences it could have had if it had been successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The names of the individuals concerned will be published on the website of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm"&gt;Official Journal of the EU&lt;/a&gt; on 22 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary visits Mauritania</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the end of his visit to Mauritania, Foreign Secretary William Hague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a pleasure to visit Mauritania. This is the first visit ever by a British Foreign Secretary. It is a sign of our interest in a closer partnership with Mauritania over the coming years, and of Mauritania’s growing role in regional issues, as well as foreign policy as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wish to engage with Mauritania as serious partners in security and foreign policy. Mauritania is in the frontline of the growing security threat from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and is an important partner for discussions on Libya, Cote d’Ivoire and wider African issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But the purpose of my visit was not just to discuss security. We are looking at ways we can help Mauritania on political reform, good governance and human rights, all of which are essential to Mauritania’s future development. I discussed the potential for UK support through our Arab Partnership Initiative, which offers practical expertise and funding to strengthen political participation, civil society and other building blocks of open democratic societies. The lesson of the Arab Spring is that demands for political freedom and economic development will grow, and we wish to help our partners who are seeking to meet the aspirations of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I also discussed the potential for an expanded economic relationship between Britain and Mauritania, as well as our support for greater trade between Europe and the Maghreb and the countries of the region themselves. This could transform the economic prospects of Mauritania and its neighbours, and underpins democratic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For all these reasons this was an important and landmark visit and we look forward to building on the cooperation we have established today. As a sign of this we are delighted that Mauritania has expressed its intention to reopen an Embassy in London.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary visits Algeria</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague has arrived in Algeria on the final stop of a tour of North Africa designed to increase British engagement and economic ties in this crucial region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit, the first by a British Foreign Secretary since February 2006, comes at a time of considerable change across North Africa. As the largest economy and most populous country in the Maghreb, Algeria will play a key role in the future prosperity and stability of the region. It has introduced some political reforms ahead of next year’s elections, and this will be a significant topic of discussion during the visit. The Arab Spring also offers opportunities for greater regional integration to the benefit of Algeria, its neighbours and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary will meet President Bouteflika and Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci. He will also hold talks with Algerian civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on arrival, the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very pleased to visit Algeria at such an important time for the country and the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All governments in the region have a strong interest in creating more open societies, greater political freedom and stronger economic development, as they seek to meet the aspirations of their people.  We welcome the political reforms the government has introduced ahead of next year’s elections. We are supporting these changes through our Arab Partnership programme in the areas of youth employment, civil society capacity building and prison reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will also discuss the situation in Libya with the Algerian government following my visit to Tripoli yesterday. As a neighbour of Libya, Algeria has an important role to play and I will urge the Government to cooperate with the Libyan authorities and the International Criminal Court as they seek to bring to justice indicted members of the former Qadhafi regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Algeria is also an important partner for the UK in counter-terrorism. We will continue to support Algeria in its fight against Al-Qaeda and to encourage a regional approach to this common threat”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary meets Pakistan Foreign Minister</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Secretary William Hague met Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar at the United Nations on Monday 19 September.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was their first face to face meeting since Ms Rabbani Khar was appointed as Pakistani Foreign Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary offered Ms Rabbani Khar condolences on the loss of life in Pakistan’s recent floods and assured her of Britain’s offer of assistance. The Foreign Secretary emphasised Britain’s commitment to assisting Pakistan’s economic growth, including through greater market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two Ministers agreed to meet in London next week and to seek early agreement on a date for the next meeting of the UK/Pakistan Enhanced Strategic Dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary paid tribute to Pakistan’s sacrifices in the struggle against terrorism.  Both Ministers agreed on the importance of UK/Pakistani cooperation against violent extremism. They shared views on the need for a process of political reconciliation in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers looked forward to attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Implications of the Arab Spring for the UK Government's Counter Terrorism Strategy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2011 has been a momentous year, seeing a confluence of events in North Africa and the Middle East historic in their sweep and significance. The eruption of democracy movements is, even in its early stages, the most important development of the early 21st century, with potential long term consequences greater than either 9/11 or the global financial crisis in 2008. An historic change which at its core, is about the people of the region demanding their legitimate rights and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a moment of huge opportunity for the people of the Middle East and North Africa to build more open societies based on the rule of law, with greater access to justice, political freedom and economic opportunity.&lt;br&gt;
At the same time, a decade from the 9/11 attacks, we have also seen the death of Usama Bin Laden, and Al Qaida under more pressure than at any point in their history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Foreign Office Minister for both the Middle East, and Counter Terrorism, I have had a privileged view of events which arguably may define the landscape in the region for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my brief remarks this lunchtime, I won’t attempt to range over events which will no doubt engage historians for decades. But rather I’d like to focus on a specific area, which is: the implications of the Arab Spring for HMG’s counter-terrorism efforts, some of which are short term and more tactical, others are more fundamental to our enduring national security.&lt;br&gt;
Arab Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the North African and Middle Eastern regimes affected by the Arab Spring kept a brutal grip over their populations - developing disproportionately large and powerful intelligence and security structures. Structures that were often brutally effective at managing the terrorist threat from within their borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many respects the Arab Spring was a direct reaction to this type of authoritarian rule, and the police and intelligence services were among the first institutions to be dismantled in the face of overwhelming popular protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short term  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the collapse of the security machinery may present some opportunities for terrorist groups to exploit. We should keep this in perspective, but we must continue to be watchful. In Libya, whilst are working with the NTC to secure arms and ammunitions dumps, we have seen indications that Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb has used the chaos to procure  weapons, and has attempted, unsuccessfully, to conduct attacks in Tunisia. In Egypt, as the security apparatus is dismantled and re-forms, and as regimes look to establish themselves, there will be an inevitable period during which local security services are less able to deal effectively with terrorism.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing these vulnerabilities makes CT relationships a vital part of our engagement in the region, and we will continue to work with local police, and security services to try and prevent terrorist attacks. The choice for us is not whether or not to reengage - but the extent of and nature of that relationship.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key focus of our wider efforts to support new regimes is to help them rebuild their CT and security sectors in a way which makes them compliant with international human rights standards and democratic norms. But most importantly, that they represent the rebalancing of power away from the shadowy world of intelligence and security, towards the people themselves.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Foreign Secretary has put it:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the Arab Spring does lead to more open and democratic societies across the Arab world over a number of years, it will be the greatest advance for human rights and freedom since the end of the Cold War. If it does not lead to these things, we could see a collapse back into more authoritarian regimes, conflict and increased terrorism in North Africa on Europe’s very doorstep”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential prize and the consequences of failure are enormous.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our relationship with Arab regimes  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much opprobrium has been directed at Western governments, the UK included - for working with authoritarian regimes, sometimes very closely, prior to the Arab Spring. And it is right that our relationships are subject to scrutiny both of substance and tone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we should note, however, that most of the terrorist threats to the UK and our interests emanate from or have strong links overseas.&lt;br&gt;
To be able to investigate and disrupt these threats means that we have to work with regimes which may not share our standards or values. Sometimes, this means working with local security services to improve their counter-terrorism capabilities - so that they are better able to manage the threat within their own borders. Or helping to improve their practises so that we are better able to work with them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of that cooperation, and the type of assistance we choose to provide, is subject to close attention and often finely balanced judgement- often our options are, necessarily, severely limited.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth remembering though, that it is often the strength of the CT relationships that we are able to establish with countries around the world that stands between us and a successful attack: for example, it was information provided by Saudi Arabia that disrupted last year’s  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQ-AP printer bomb plot.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can do is ensure that, wherever possible, the assistance we provide -  be that equipment or training - will not be used for internal repression, and that the nature of our relationships remains true to our own values, principles and indeed legal obligations. This is a commitment that runs throughout our published CT strategy, CONTEST - and is particularly important now, after the Arab Spring.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have also made it abundantly clear the standards they expect in the conduct of our foreign affairs and in how our intelligence and security services operate. Which is why in the early weeks of being in Government, the PM announced an independent inquiry by Sir Peter Gibson into the UK’s involvement with detainees in overseas counter-terrorism operations. And why clear guidance has now been published on how to deal with detainees held by other countries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Qaida  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what of Al Qaida’s role?&lt;br&gt;
They too have been surprised by the scale and speed of events - and have failed to have any significant bearing on the Arab Spring. The popular and largely peaceful protests that swept across the Arab world were the most obvious refutation of a core tenet of AQ’s ideology, that change can only be brought about by violent jihad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These popular, peaceful protests have already achieved more in a short few months -  against deeply entrenched regimes -  than AQ’s 23 year campaign of violence.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death of UBL  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the death of UBL was another hugely significant moment. The analysts may disagree over his precise role within the organisation at the time of his death, but what is certain is that he was AQ’s totem and figurehead. In a short space of time, a core tenet of AQ’s ideology was refuted in the most emphatic terms, and their leader and inspiration was killed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership of AQ is now weaker than at any point. It played no role in recent political change in North Africa and the Middle East. Its ideology has been widely discredited. Further international pressure can reduce its capability still further. But AQ continues to pose a threat, and groups affiliated to AQ - notably in Yemen and Somalia - have emerged to be a substantial threat in their own right, and we have seen recently with the attack by Boko Haram against the UN compound in Nigeria that the threat continues to evolve.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why, in spite of the significant events of 2011, we cannot for a moment afford to be complacent about terrorism. And why, in this 10th anniversary year, we must redouble our CT efforts. This requires a global effort, hard security, as well as support for popular reform in the  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arab World.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al Qaida’s inability to influence events in North Africa and the Middle East is probably a true reflection of their legitimacy and level of support. But we must be mindful that AQ are not allowed to shape the next stage; that the passion for reform shown by people across the region is not allowed to spoil; and that their expectations can be matched by the new regimes giving them the freedoms and choice that they demand.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Long term Security  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this is the absolute core of the Arab Spring. This is what has the potential to elevate the events of 2011 to a similar plane as the collapse of communism. It is not an issue of what impact freer, more democratic Arab societies can have an Al Qaida’s fate - important though that is. But rather it is about the possibility of developing a far closer partnership with peoples on Europe’s doorstep, of greater social and economic exchange. It is the prospect of mutual security based not on hard security, but of shared values and common interest.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these are Arab revolutions not ours. Change has been led by the people of the region and it is not for us to dictate the pace or nature of that change.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is an important role for the UK to be play: to be clear about our values and support reformers in the region.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response of governments must be non-violent. Leaders need to address the legitimate aspirations of the people of the region with reform, not repression. Where human rights are abused and lives are threatened we will not be silent bystanders. That is why in Libya, we acted swiftly to prevent the massacre of citizens in Benghazi. And in Syria, the EU has adopted additional sanctions on those responsible for, or associated with, the unacceptable and brutal repression we continue to witness there. These sanctions are targeted carefully and designed to encourage President Assad and those around him to reject the use of violence and embrace genuine reform. We are also committed to increase pressure on the regime at the United Nations. The UN Security Council Presidential Statement issued on 3 August condemned the violence in Syria, but left the way open for a return to calling for a UNSCR.   We will push again should we assess that there is need for one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary statement on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking today, the Foreign Secretary William Hague said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today we commemorate the citizens of the United States and over 90 countries who perished in the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, including 67 British nationals. We remember the courage and dignity of the American people in the face of such appalling loss. And we also recall the victims of other global acts of terrorism since - including the attacks in London in 2005. Such attacks have only served to bring the international community closer together, and to bolster those who seek change through peaceful means, not through barbaric violence.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the decade since the 2001 attacks on the United States, terrorists have succeeded only in the murder of innocents, often from among those they claim to represent. Al Qaeda is now weaker than at any time in the decade since 9/11 - and political progress through peaceful protest in the Middle East and North Africa has shown it to be increasingly irrelevant to the future. The true expression of what people in the Muslim world aspire to was seen not at Ground Zero in 2001, but in squares and streets across the Middle East and North Africa this year.  So while we remember the victims of 9/11, stand firm with our allies and remain tirelessly vigilant against future threats, we also face the future with confidence in our values and faith in human nature”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/we-will-continue-to-fight-against-terrorism-wherever-it-rears-its-head"/>
    <title>"We will continue to fight against terrorism wherever it rears its head"</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain years that stand out because of the confluence of events of extraordinary significance that may change the course of history. By any standard, 2011 is already such a momentous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eruption of democracy movements across the Middle East and North Africa is, even in its early stages, the most important development of the early 21st century, with potential long term consequences greater than either 9/11 or the global financial crisis in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death of Osama Bin Laden this week was a devastating but not a terminal blow to Al Qaeda.  We will continue to fight against terrorism wherever it rears its head with renewed determination, and in Afghanistan now is the time for the Taliban to make a decisive break from Al Qaeda and engage in a political process.  &lt;br&gt;
But in the long run it is the people of the Muslim world who will inflict the greatest defeat of all on Al Qaeda and its ideology. Some people wrongly thought that 9/11 was the expression of Muslim grievances; but it was not. The true expression of what the people of the Muslim world want was seen in Tahrir Square in 2011, not at Ground Zero in 2001.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already three lessons that we can learn from what has happened in the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that the forces that led to the Arab Spring will sweep more widely across the globe. Demands for open government, action against corruption and greater political participation will spread by themselves over time - not because Western nations are advocating them, but because they are the natural aspirations of all people everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is that Governments that set their face against reform altogether - as Libya has done and Syria sadly is beginning to do - are doomed to failure. Simply refusing to address legitimate grievances or attempting to stamp them out will fail. The idea of freedom cannot be confined behind bars, however strong the lock.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is that these political changes will now reveal an immense economic task. While the people of Egypt and Tunisia made a monumental effort to bring change in their countries, the economic challenges they now face will be at least as great. There is a potentially explosive tension between people’s expectations of immediate economic benefits from their revolutions and the need for these new governments to take difficult measures to open their economies and offer more opportunity to their citizens. We have to do our utmost to help the Arab world make a success of more open political systems and economies, and it is massively in our own interest to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Arab Spring does lead to more open and democratic societies across the Arab world over a number of years, it will be the greatest advance for human rights and freedom since the end of the Cold War. If it does not lead to these things, we could see a collapse back into more authoritarian regimes, conflict and increased terrorism in North Africa on Europe’s very doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we are engaged in Libya with our allies, responding to the call of the Arab League for military action to prevent the loss of countless lives. We have gone to great lengths to ensure that we have a legal mandate from the UN Security Council and that militarily and politically we are working as one with Arab states to protect civilians and support a legitimate opposition. At the Contact Group meeting in Rome tomorrow we will further intensify the diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the Qadhafi regime. Today’s report from the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on the crimes committed by the Qadhafi regime should leave no one in any doubt of the importance of this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, we are mustering international diplomatic action to pressure President Assad to stop the killing and repression and to take the path of genuine reform. I have instructed our diplomats to begin discussions with our partners at the UN in New York to seek UN condemnation of the situation in Syria. And we are working this week on European sanctions on those responsible for the violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the region we urge Arab nations to address grievances through dialogue and democratic reform, not through violence. Long-term stability requires real steps towards representative institutions, political pluralism, a free media and economic fairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country is sovereign and we must always respect that. Each country has the right to develop in its own way and in accordance with its own culture and traditions. But we can also encourage positive change by being open ourselves to a dramatic new level of engagement with the countries of the Arab world. This would bring huge benefits for these countries and for our own security and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our government will use Britain’s weight and influence in the European Union, the United Nations, the G8 and the International Financial Institutions to call for a transformative new relationship with the countries of the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already begun this work ourselves through our new Arab Partnership Initiative on democratic and social reform, which we intend to expand. And when the G8 Summit countries meet in France this month we will call for a new plan to coordinate and expand international financial assistance to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also crucial that the European Union’s response matches the epochal nature of these events.  I have never believed that the EU could or should act as if it were a nation state with a national foreign policy. Any attempt by EU institutions to do so would end in embarrassing failure.  But I do believe that it is very much in the nations of Europe’s interests to use their collective weight in the world to advance common goals and values and changes in the Arab World are exactly such an instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s reaction to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe was far-sighted and an astonishing success.  In 1990 the EU and NATO allies offered “the hand of friendship” to the new democracies of central and eastern Europe. Twenty years later, countries that laboured under communism have become free, democratic states and members of the EU and of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our challenge now is how we mirror that achievement to the south, helping to transform countries whose success is closely tied to European security and prosperity but whose future will not lie within the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe it is time for our generation to offer its own hand of friendship to the people of the countries on the southern borders of Europe. We should show, in the words of our Prime Minister, that “we stand today with the people and governments who are on the side of justice, of the rule of law, and of freedom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU already has the tools and the resources for the task.  What it has lacked is the will to use them well. We should use the EU’s economic magnetism to encourage and support real political and economic reform. That means a new partnership with the southern neighbourhood with a simple proposal at its heart: that the EU will share its prosperity and open up markets in return for real progress on political and economic reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should offer broad and deep economic integration, leading to a free-trade area and eventually a customs union, progressively covering goods, agriculture and services, as well as the improvement of conditions for investment. All of this must should be accompanied by our partners achieving clear and sustainable reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of ambition would be in accordance with our beliefs, in line with our national interest, and support international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call on governments of the region to join us in this approach. We do so as a country that has many long-term and historic friendships in the Middle East and North Africa. We value and are committed to our cooperation in security, defence, diplomacy and trade. We are working alongside Arab nations to counter terrorism, to support the people of Libya, to resolve political deadlock in Yemen and to bring stability in Afghanistan, and there is potential for even greater cooperation in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to those who think there is another road - one of repression, tightening security, and a hardening grip on citizens - we offer a word of caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No government on earth can resist demands for democratic change forever, if their people want it and demand it. Nowhere in the world has the attempt to preserve dictatorship without consent succeeded; not in Europe, not in Africa, Latin America or Asia. As President Reagan said in 1982 of the Soviet Union “any system is inherently unstable that has no peaceful means to legitimise its rulers”. There is no single model for democracy, but in our view there is no greater legitimacy that any government can acquire than through free elections that consult the will of all its people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reform is not a threat to stability, it is the guarantor of it over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not credible or acceptable to repress now and suggest that reform will follow later, or to use public order as an excuse to oppress critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor will it be sustainable over the long term to promise economic reform without steady political development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments that curb human rights and roll back reform are stoking up anger and frustration that will spill over in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those like the Government of Iran, who show the breathtaking hypocrisy of claiming to support peaceful protest abroad, but brutally suppress it at home, will find that their people see through this position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not starry-eyed about this. There are risks ahead. All change brings the risk of instability and there are some who will seek any opportunity to create chaos. But legitimate grievances have to be addressed.&lt;br&gt;
This includes in our view an urgent need to revive the Middle East Peace Process, which must not be allowed to become a casualty of uncertainty in the region. We see a compelling need for urgent process on a two state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Essential compromises that are difficult and painful now may become impossible in the future unless the moment is seized, and we call on both sides to re-enter negotiations. Britain hopes that the announcement of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas will lead to the formation of a government that rejects violence and pursues a negotiated peace leading to a Palestinian state living in peace and security alongside a secure Israel. We will judge a future Palestinian administration by its actions and its readiness to work for peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes taking place in the Middle East and North Africa reflect global trends that are shaping the world around the United Kingdom. We need to adapt our foreign policy to the networked world of the 21st century in which economic might and influence is moving away from the handful of states that were dominant after the Cold War to a range of nations large and small; and in which no one nation can solve any global problem alone, from climate change to nuclear proliferation - with what the Deputy Prime Minister has called “the globalisation of many of our problems”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires us to connect Britain up to the fastest growing parts of the world economy in commerce, soft power and in diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside our indispensable relationship with the United States and our role in Europe, we now have to work more closely with countries like Brazil, which now has more diplomats in more countries in Africa than we do, and Turkey, which is Europe’s fastest growing economy and is a crucial partner for us in the Balkans, the Middle East and further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires a greater emphasis on bilateral and commercial diplomacy alongside our vital role in multilateral organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who say that foreign policy should not have a strong commercial element overlook two essential points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that diplomatic alliances and political influence can often be built on strong commercial relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is that since government spending cannot be the engine of growth in EU economies, the expansion of trade is an absolute prerequisite for our success and influence, and an absolute need for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The livelihoods of people up and down the country depend on a British economy that is strong and growing. It is the lifeblood of our health service, our schools, our roads, our Armed Forces and our ability to give generously to the development of other nations. Our economy will not be strong without - among other things - taking the best of British goods and services into markets overseas and attracting other nations to invest in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we will make no apology for insisting that the whole of Government does its part to support British people and British livelihoods, that our Ministers champion Britain as a centre for trade and investment, and that alongside all that they do to cure the ills of the world our Embassies fight for the British economy too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As emerging economies look in different directions across new networks of commerce and diplomacy, no country can trade on its past unless it has something to offer in the present, as Britain does in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our own ready-made networks that enable us to plug into the most vibrant markets around the world and to form new partnerships in diplomacy. History has given us membership of the Commonwealth - an association of two billion citizens spanning six continents and some of the world’s fastest growing economies. There is huge strategic opportunity open to Britain if we are able to make more of our historic ties in the Commonwealth and other parts of the world, and if we are forge new diplomatic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So over the last year we have placed a renewed emphasis on bilateral relations, alongside Britain’s role in multilateral institutions. We have increased the number of Ministers in the Foreign Office. I have visited a string of countries where no British Foreign Secretary has set foot in many years, not only in trouble spots such as Yemen and potential new friends such as Tunisia, but also neglected old friends such as Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And next week I will set out in Parliament our plans to strengthen Britain’s global diplomatic network, including the opening of some new Embassies and the building up of our diplomatic presence in the emerging economies. We will arrest and in some places reverse the steady shrinking of Britain’s diplomatic footprint overseas under the last government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the foreign policy of this coalition government has as its starting point the needs and interests of British people. It looks fearlessly at the world as it is now, but also as it is likely to be in decades to come. It rejects any notion of the strategic shrinkage of Britain’s role in the world, and instead is bent on diplomatic advance. It asks what we must do as a government and a nation to ensure that our people have prosperity and security, in the broadest sense, long into the future. And it is designed to create, over the coming years, the strongest possible basis for a Britain that is a confident, outward-looking and responsible global power for many years to come. It is the distinctive British foreign policy that we promised on our first day in office and which we will take forward with even greater vigour and intensity in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1805 my political hero William Pitt addressed the Lord Mayor’s Banquet, two days after news had reached London of Nelson’s victory over the combined French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, saving the country from invasion. His speech was only forty words long, but I think it was one of the finest ever given. In response to being toasted as the saviour of Europe he said to the assembled guests: “I return you many thanks for the honour you have done me; but Europe is not to be saved by any single man. England has saved herself by her exertions, and will, as I trust, save Europe by her example.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now 206 years later and looking to the future, I am confident that the British people can shape a prosperous future through their exertions, and that the power of our example in international affairs and our influence in the world will continue undiminished in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you join me in a final toast, “To the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>"Pakistan will remain a very important security partner"</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve lost a lot of their own security forces to terrorism. They’re fighting it very hard in their own country and of course they’re playing a key role in Afghanistan. Pakistan will remain a very important security partner for us and for the international community.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader of al Qaeda Osama Bin Laden was killed in a United States operation in Pakistan on 1 May.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier the Prime Minister said that it’s too early to judge how much the Pakistani authorities knew about Osama Bin Laden’s whereabouts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Clearly Bin Laden had a support system within Pakistan; we don’t yet know what that support system included, but what we do know is the leaders of that country, democratically elected, want to join with us in fighting terror in Pakistan and around the world. So we should work with the democratic forces of Pakistan to make sure that all of that country is doing everything it can to combat terrorism and extremism, as their political leaders want to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt advised British nationals to exercise extra vigilance while abroad:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve not needed to change the general threat level to United Kingdom citizens. It is just a matter of common sense at the moment. There might be places that they should avoid in terms of large crowds, potential demonstrations and things like that, and so we’re just warning UK citizens first of all to look at the Foreign Office website and the travel advice and just be extra careful.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that there is no new information that’s led to a specific threat to British nationals:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to be sensible and cautious in the light of events yesterday. There is a concern that there might be some form of reprisal so we’ve heightened the security around all our Embassies and Consulates around the world, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan but we’ve nothing to indicate a specific threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Changes to special assistance for British victims of terrorism abroad</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has offered the assistance since 2004. Originally known as the Aftercare Plan, but renamed Exceptional Assistance Measures (EAM) in 2008, it was introduced in recognition of the fact that many travel insurance policies explicitly exclude acts of terrorism from their cover.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EAM allow ministers to activate special assistance to victims of terrorist attacks above the standard consular package. This can include medical evacuation, payment of immediate medical expenses and repatriation. &lt;br&gt;
In 2008, the Government at the time decided to impose restrictions on EAM eligibility that excluded those victims who did not have travel insurance. Jeremy Browne notified Parliament today that he had decided to reverse this decision.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Written Ministerial Statement, the Minister for Consular Policy said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have decided to overturn the decision of the previous government and restore Emergency Assistance Measures for all British Nationals affected by a terrorist attack overseas, regardless of whether or not they have travel insurance.  Acts of terrorism are singularly heinous crimes, usually targeting innocent people at random.  It is right that all British victims of terrorist attacks overseas can receive the same level of support from the Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Emergency Assistance Measures only cover incidents overseas that are deemed to be acts of terrorism by Her Majesty’s Government.  They do not replace travel insurance.  British nationals travelling overseas are strongly advised to take out comprehensive travel insurance.  Those that do not and are involved in accidents or incidents often deeply regret it when faced with huge bills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
