    <title>The future of the citizenship survey</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The citizenship survey is a face-to-face household survey carried out by the Department for Communities and Local Government covering a representative core sample of almost 10,000 adults in England and Wales each year, plus a minority ethnic boost sample of 5,000 and a Muslim boost sample of 1,200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statistical consultation sets out the intention to cancel the future citizenship survey, and in doing so, seeks to identify the uses of the survey data, the implications of stopping and options for alternative information sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Sustainable Communities Act 2007 regulations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 December 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government issued a second invitation to local authorities under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 (‘The Act’). He invited councils to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take whatever action they see fit to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If councils, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal ‘proposal’ asking government to remove the barrier through the online portal at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/"&gt;barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action. We would, for example, welcome requests to remove barriers from organisations such as town and parish councils, and County Associations of Parish Councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act was amended in April 2010 to allow the procedures for receiving, considering and deciding proposals under the Act to be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act now allows the arrangements for the consideration of proposals submitted in response to the invitation to be set out in regulations, following a period of consultation. There will be no deadlines for the submission of proposals, which can now be submitted straight to the government at any time. Information on the action the government is taking on the proposals will be available online so that councils and communities can track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act, and the proposed draft regulations set out in this consultation, is a means to hold government to account and ensure each proposal is given the fullest consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation aims to establish an evidence base regarding the use of restrictive covenants which prevent pubs from being used as such once they are sold, and the impact that this has on local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responses to the consultation will be used by the government to help assess whether action needs to be undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Proposed policy statement for part 2 of the Localism Act 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation is on a proposed policy statement for Part 2 of the Localism Act 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act provides a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central government and towards local people. The government has given public authorities more powers and freedoms to conduct their business and deliver services to the public. This includes a major reduction in the ‘oversight’ role of central government. Public authorities must, therefore, accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions or omissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of the Localism Act is about incentivising public authorities to comply with European law, in order to avoid any financial sanctions in the first place. The proposed policy statement sets out a fair, proportionate and reasonable approach for the use of Part 2. The statement has been developed with the Local Government Association and the Greater London Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 December 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government issued a second invitation to local authorities under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. He invited local authorities to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take appropriate action to make it happen. The Localism Act has given them far more freedom and flexibility to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If local authorities, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal ‘proposal’ under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 asking Government to remove the barrier through the online portal at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/"&gt;http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is seeking views on whether the existing arrangements for submitting barrier busting proposals are appropriate or whether town and parish councils should be able to submit proposals using the Sustainable Communities Act as well as local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Dealing with illegal and unauthorised encampments: a summary of available powers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent experience has brought into focus the question of balance between the right to peaceful protest and the disruptive impact of the illegal occupation of land. In addition, the formation of unauthorised campsites by traveller groups can be problematic for the general public and private landowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On occasion local authorities and their partner agencies have been unclear about the full range of powers available to them to tackle both illegal and unauthorised encampments sites. This summary is intended to be an accessible source of information providing an overview of powers available and to enable the timely reclamation of land and property. This information complements the Department’s Guide to effective use of enforcement powers - Part 1: unauthorised encampments (see below) and is primarily aimed at local authority officials, but it is also intended to be helpful to landowners and others affected by such encampments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proposed policy statement to accompany Part 2 of the Localism Act was developed with the Local Government Association and Greater London Authority.
