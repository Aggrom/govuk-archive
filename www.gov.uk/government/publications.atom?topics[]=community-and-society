    <title>Dealing with illegal and unauthorised encampments: a summary of available powers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent experience has brought into focus the question of balance between the right to peaceful protest and the disruptive impact of the illegal occupation of land. In addition, the formation of unauthorised campsites by traveller groups can be problematic for the general public and private landowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On occasion local authorities and their partner agencies have been unclear about the full range of powers available to them to tackle both illegal and unauthorised encampments sites. This summary is intended to be an accessible source of information providing an overview of powers available and to enable the timely reclamation of land and property. This information complements the Department’s Guide to effective use of enforcement powers - Part 1: unauthorised encampments (see below) and is primarily aimed at local authority officials, but it is also intended to be helpful to landowners and others affected by such encampments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projects included in this document showcase best practice and the varied approaches that community groups have taken to getting land to use for their food growing projects. From space on housing estates now being run as a mini social enterprise, to derelict allotment land, every project shows that where community groups work together with their local authorities or other local landowners, great achievements can follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of carrying out the interviews was to listen directly to families about their lives, the problems they have experienced and caused and to begin to understand the sort of help that will enable them to really change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Policy statement for part 2 of the Localism Act 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proposed policy statement to accompany Part 2 of the Localism Act was developed with the Local Government Association and Greater London Authority. The consultation on the proposed statement ended on 22 April 2012. As a result, the policy statement has been revised and is now available in final form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act provides a substantial and lasting shift in power away from central government and towards local people. The government has given public authorities more powers and freedoms to conduct their business and deliver services to the public. This includes a major reduction in the ‘oversight’ role of central government. Public authorities must, therefore, accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions or omissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of the Localism Act is about incentivising public authorities to comply with European law, in order to avoid any financial sanctions in the first place. The policy statement sets out a fair, proportionate and reasonable approach for the use of Part 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Community Right to Challenge: statutory guidance</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guidance provides further explanation of the legislative framework for the Community Right to Challenge. This is contained in Part 5, Chapter 2 of the Localism Act 2011, The Community Right to Challenge (Expressions of Interest and Excluded Services) (England) Regulations 2012, and The Community Right to Challenge (Fire and Rescue Authorities and Rejection of Expressions of Interest) (England) Regulations 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act was enacted on 15 November 2011. The Community Right to Challenge was commenced on 27 June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Proposals from town and parish councils under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 December 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government issued a second invitation to local authorities under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. He invited local authorities to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take appropriate action to make it happen. The Localism Act has given them far more freedom and flexibility to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If local authorities, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal ‘proposal’ under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 asking Government to remove the barrier through the online portal at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/"&gt;http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is seeking views on whether the existing arrangements for submitting barrier busting proposals are appropriate or whether town and parish councils should be able to submit proposals using the Sustainable Communities Act as well as local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

It also describes the support mechanisms that have been put in place to help departments dispose of land and the next steps for the programme in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As set out in Budget 2012 sufficient land has been identified to meet the government’s ambition to dispose of land with the capacity to build over 100,000 homes by April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

In November 2010, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government set up a ministerial working group to tackle these issues, bringing together ministers from 7 government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This progress report includes 28 commitments from across government that will help mainstream services work more effectively with the gypsy and traveller communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Your guide to organising a street party</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step-by-step guide provides practical advice for anyone looking to hold a street party to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee, the Big Jubilee Lunch, or the 2012 Olympics or Paralympics. It addresses some of the popular myths surrounding street parties and sets the record straight on what is actually needed (including on road closures, charges, playing music and insurance) as well as providing links to external organisations who offer support and advice to those looking to organise their own street parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance includes a model street party form showing the sort of information local authorities will need to know about the event, but you can also access your own local authority’s guidance and form via Directgov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities are being encouraged to support local residents in bringing down any barriers that stop local areas from holding small private street parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=1580&amp;amp;LGIL=8&amp;amp;ServiceName=Find%20out%20how%20to%20hold%20a%20street%20party"&gt;DirectGov website&lt;/a&gt; to access local information on street parties by entering your postcode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
