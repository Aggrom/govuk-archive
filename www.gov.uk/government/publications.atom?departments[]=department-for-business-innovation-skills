    <title>The business case for equality and diversity: a survey of the academic literature</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Looks at the evidence for the business case for equality and diversity in private sector organisations.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report sets out the findings from a systematic review of the literature on the business case for equality and diversity. It was commissioned by the Department for Business Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) and the Government Equalities Office (GEO). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report aims to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve understanding of theoretical positions and issues related to the business case for equality and diversity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;develop a consistent framework for assessing evidence on the business case&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;within this framework, review the evidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a compendium of the evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research assesses the most robust evidence, draw implications from the findings and present a dispassionate picture of the evidence identifying gaps and conflicting messages. The report looks at diversity in terms of ‘protected characteristics’ that are defined in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents"&gt;Equality Act 2010&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>24+ advanced learning loans: specific learner groups</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Research on a proposal for learners aged 24 and above, studying at level 3 and above, to pay higher contributions towards costs.
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports research findings on the government’s proposal for adults aged 24 and above, who study for qualifications at level 3 and above, to make greater contributions to the costs of their learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government proposes to remove grant funding for these further education learners and courses. This will allow the government to focus investment on younger and lower-qualified learners who are less likely to invest in themselves. Instead, the government will provide income-contingent loans to cover the resulting upfront costs, in line with its principles of promoting fairness and personal responsibility. These 24+ Advanced Learning Loans will be made available to new learners from the 2013/14 academic year, with the first full year expected to be the 2014/15 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS carried out an impact assessment to show the economic costs and benefits of this proposal, and an equality impact assessment to look at how the proposal will affect different types of learners. This report explores these assessments, and looks at how learners are likely to respond to the 24+ Advanced Learning Loans proposal, and how its impact on their decisions and behaviours could be minimised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research provides a greater understanding of four specific learner groups: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those aged 40+, and particularly those out of work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;those with mental or physical disabilities or learning difficulties have particular needs regarding communication and information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;those seeking to take up Advanced/Higher Apprentices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Muslim learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research indicated that most learner groups are unlikely to be put off by the loans proposition, provided it is communicated effectively. It also highlighted groups which are likely to face specific issues and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines describe the requirements that apply in the United Kingdom for assessing and appointing notified bodies under the Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1554) (“the 2010 Regulations”). These Regulations implement the provisions of the EC Pyrotechnics Directive (2007/23/EC) in UK law.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notified bodies are appointed under and operate according to the law which transposes the provisions of the directive.

    <title>Enterprise Finance Guarantee</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) is a loan guarantee scheme to facilitate additional lending to viable small and medium size enterprises lacking adequate security or proven track record for a normal commercial loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme was launched in January 2009 to facilitate additional lending to viable businesses lacking adequate security or proven track record for a standard commercial loan. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 19,700 SMEs have been offered EFG loans with a total value in excess of £2 billion. 
EFG is a demand led scheme complimentary to commercial lending – not a replacement. EFG accounts for 1% to 2% of total SME lending.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Businesses that meet the basic eligibility criteria do not have an automatic entitlement to receive an EFG guaranteed loan.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decision making on individual loans is fully delegated to the participating lenders and is integrated with the commercial decision to lend. Where the lender determines the business is viable (able to meet the monthly loan repayments and repay the loan in full) but is lacking adequate security to meet the lenders standard lending requirements, they can consider providing a loan under EFG. The government plays no role in the loan decision process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government provides the lender with a guarantee for 75% of each individual loan, subject to a cap set by an Annual Claim Limit. The borrower pays a 2% per annum pro-rata premium to BIS as a contribution towards the cost of providing the government guarantee. The borrower is responsible for repayment of 100% of the loan, not just the 25% outside the coverage of the government guarantee. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the case of default, lenders are required to follow their standard commercial recovery procedures, including the realisation of available security before a claim can be made against the guarantee. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under EFG, lenders are entitled to take security, including personal guarantees. This is standard commercial practice and an established mechanism for ensuring a degree of personal commitment to repayment of the loan by the business. In EFG this means there is a three-way risk sharing between borrower, lender and the government. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lenders are expressly prohibited from taking a charge over a principal private residence for an EFG facility. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="efg-eligibility-criteria"&gt;EFG eligibility criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that meet the basic eligibility criteria do not have an automatic entitlement to receive an EFG guaranteed loan. Eligibility for EFG will be determined by the lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a guideline only. EFG is open to viable businesses that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operate in the UK &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a turnover of up to £41 million &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are seeking finance between £1,000 and £1million &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;repayment terms from 3 months to 10 years (less for overdraft and invoice finance facilities) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operate in a sector that is eligible for EFG (most sectors are eligible) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG is subject to certain sector restrictions arising from the EU de minimis State Aid rules under which it operates. A list of the main sector restrictions is provided in the EFG Business Sectors attachment below. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG loans typically require all the same information that banks need to process a commercial loan application. Participating lenders will advise you of their specific requirements (failure to provide the required information may delay the loan decision or lead to a loan decline). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenders will typically assess loan applications against their standard lending criteria to determine whether they wish to lend. Where the lender determines the business is viable (able to meet the monthly loan repayments and repay the loan in full) but is lacking adequate security to meet the lenders normal lending requirements, they can consider providing a loan under EFG. The government plays no role in the loan decision process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the lender has determined that use of EFG is likely to be appropriate, they confirm eligibility and record details of the borrower and their facility via a secure Web Portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that do not meet the lenders viability requirements are not suitable for EFG. EFG is intended to support lending to businesses which can ultimately repay their loan in full, not prop up unviable businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-government-guarantee"&gt;The government guarantee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing lenders with a government-backed guarantee for 75% of the value of each individual loan, subject to a cap set by an Annual Claim Limit, EFG facilitates lending that would otherwise not take place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guarantee provides protection to the lender in the event of default by the borrower – it is not insurance for the borrower in the event of their inability to repay the loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The borrower is responsible for repayment of 100% of the EFG facility, not just the 25% outside the coverage of the government guarantee. Where defaults occur, the lender is obliged to follow their standard commercial recovery procedure, including the realisation of security, before they can make a claim against the government guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the costs and fees charged by the lender, businesses supported under EFG are required to pay an additional 2% annual premium which partially covers the cost of providing the guarantee. The premium is assessed and collected quarterly in advance throughout the life of the loan based on the outstanding capital balance of the loan (for invoice finance and overdraft guarantees the premium is assessed on the agreed facility limit). The borrower is provided with a premium schedule by the lender as part of their loan documentation and collection is made by Direct Debit under the description “BIS LOAN GUARANTEE”. The interest rate charged and any other fees and charges applied to the loan are a commercial matter for the lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="security--personal-guarantees"&gt;Security / personal guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under EFG, lenders are entitled to take security, including personal guarantees. This is standard commercial practice and an established mechanism for ensuring a degree of personal commitment to repayment of the loan by the business. In EFG this means there is a three-way risk sharing between borrower, lender and the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taking security, lenders are required to apply their normal commercial policies in determining the extent and value of security available. The exception from normal commercial practice is that lenders are expressly prohibited from taking a charge over a principal private residence for an EFG facility. 
A personal guarantee should not be taken or attributed, solely or preferentially to cover the 25% of the EFG loan not covered by the Government guarantee. The borrower is liable for repayment of 100% of the loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EFG should not be seen by borrowers or their advisers as a mechanism for putting personal assets beyond consideration (principal private residence excluded for the purposes of EFG). If the lender refuses to offer EFG on the basis that the borrower had access to security which they were not prepared to put forward, then the lenders decision would be fully supported by BIS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enterprise-finance-guarantee-further-help"&gt;Enterprise Finance Guarantee: further help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of EFG, including the decision on whether or not it is appropriate to use it in connection with any specific lending transaction, is fully delegated to the participating lenders. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121017180846/http:/www.capitalforenterprise.gov.uk/" title="Information about Capital for Enterprise Limited"&gt;Capital for Enterprise Limited&lt;/a&gt; oversees the running of EFG on behalf of BIS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="for-lenders"&gt;For lenders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals within a participating lender should contact their central processing team or other designated internal EFG expert who can obtain further information from CfEL if required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="for-businesses"&gt;For businesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses may wish to consider approaching one or more of the participating lenders to discuss their borrowing needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that have any issues relating to an EFG loan, including premium collection or alterations to their repayment profile, should raise them with their lender and not with BIS or CfEL. &lt;/p&gt;

Customers dissatisfied with the experience of dealing with their bank should raise their concerns through the bank’s own customer complaints procedure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that have loan applications declined have the right to appeal the decision. This can be done through banks existing complaints procedures. Further information on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121017180846/http:/www.betterbusinessfinance.co.uk/help-support/factsheets/appeals-process" title="Further information on the appeals process"&gt;appeals process is available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If businesses do not feel that their complaint has been handled appropriately, those with a turnover of under €2 million and fewer than ten employees have the option of taking their complaint to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121017180846/http:/www.fos.org.uk/" title="Information about the Financial Ombudsman Service"&gt;Financial Ombudsman Service&lt;/a&gt; or on 0845 080 1800. Businesses may also wish to seek legal advice if there is a contractual dispute. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Approach to charging</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Part of the government response to the consultation on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, now known as the Public Data Group (PDG).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government launched a formal consultation on 4 August 2011 to look in detail at key questions on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, which since the Autumn Statement in November 2011 is now known as the Public Data Group (PDG). The consultation questions focused on: charging, licensing and regulatory oversight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the initial government response to the consultation, published in March 2012, the government committed that it “will continue to consider the options for charging including those set out in the consultation and will report back by the end of 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, based on information supplied by the Public Data Group Trading Funds (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) the following slides have been put together to clarify the approach to charging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides provide an overview of the regulatory and guidance framework, the differences between the trading funds which underpin their approach to charging and an overview of the current charging models including reference to some of the work being undertaken to respond to changes in the end markets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Public Data Group’s commitment to ongoing collaborations and sharing of best practice, we will continue to build on this work and focus on developing appropriate frameworks and guidelines to help deliver new charging models relevant to the Public Data Group Trading Funds and their respective markets. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on the repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is seeking views on the possible repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 (PMA). The PMA makes it an offence to make false or misleading statements in the course of an estate agency or property development business about property offered for sale. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) provide similar protections for consumers. This duplication may be unnecessary; putting additional burdens on business, without providing additional protection for consumers. The consultation considers whether the Government should repeal the PMA, now that the CPRs are in place.&lt;/p&gt;
