    <title>Gypsy and traveller caravan count: July 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release presents data from the count of gypsy and traveller caravans in England which took place on or around 19 July 2012. The twice-yearly count takes place in January and July, recording the number of caravans on both authorised and unauthorised sites across England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The July 2012 count also included a count of new affordable residential pitches for the second time. This was done to allow such pitches to be included in the calculation of the New Homes Bonus for individual local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local authority borrowing and investments 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Local Authority Borrowing and Investments statistics produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government were released on Thursday 13 September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total gross borrowing of the local government sector rose 16 per cent in the past year from £70.6bn to £81.8bn at the end of 2011-12. This represented a 33 per cent increase over five years from £61.4bn at the end of 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;excluding the one-off Housing Revenue Account (HRA) settlement of a net £8.1bn, total borrowing would have been £73.7bn at the end of 2011-12, a 5 per cent increase from 2010-11 and 20 per cent since 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99 per cent of borrowing is longer-term; of this longer-term borrowing 75 per cent was with the Public Works Loan Board&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;total investments rose from £25.1bn at the end of 2010-11 to £26.1bn at the end of 2011-12, an increase of 4 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as at 31 March 2012, 62 per cent of all investments were with banks and building societies, a decrease from 69 per cent at 31 March 2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Local authority revenue expenditure and financing in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the provisional outturn estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for 2011-12 were released on 30 August 2012 under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue expenditure by local authorities in England was £99.9 billion in 2011-12, a decrease from £104.3 billion in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26.5 per cent of revenue expenditure in 2011-12 was funded through council tax, 29.5 per cent through formula grant and 46.5 per cent through specific grants inside Aggregate External Finance and Local Services Support Grant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12 local authorities added £2.6 billion to their reserves. This includes figures for Greater London Authority, who added £0.6 billion to their reserves. Excluding GLA, authorities added £2.0 billion to their reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local Authorities net current expenditure for education services was £40.2 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education expenditure for 2011-12 is not comparable to previous years due to a number of schools changing their status to become academies, which are centrally funded rather than funded by local authorities. There has also been a transfer of responsibilities between NHS and local government relating to adults with learning difficulties in long stay NHS institutions. As a result of this discontinuity between the two financial years (2010-11 &amp;amp; 2011-12), it is difficult to compare total net current expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homelessness-prevention-and-relief-england-2011-to-2012"/>
    <title>Homelessness prevention and relief: England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an official statistics release on homelessness prevention and relief in England that took place outside the homelessness statutory framework in 2011 to 2012. This is the 4th year for which figures on homelessness prevention and relief have been published by the Department for Communities and Local Government under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the previous three releases were badged as ‘experimental’ official statistics in recognition that this is a relatively new data series, DCLG statisticians judge that the response rates and the quality of the figures received for 2011-12 have now improved enough for the ‘experimental’ label to now be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, a total of 199,000 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases, 174,800 (88 per cent) were preventions and 24,200 (12 per cent) were cases of relief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the total number of cases of homelessness prevention or relief increased by 5 per cent when compared to 2010-11. This is due to prevention cases increasing by 7 per cent, whilst cases of relief decreased by 2 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, 57 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 43 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home. This has not changed since 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the most common action taken to prevent or relieve homelessness was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation. In 2011-12, 27,600 cases (14 per cent) were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation this way, though this was a decrease of 10 per cent compared to 2010-11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the amount of homelessness prevention and relief activity varied across the regions. The North East had the highest rate of cases of prevention and relief with 11.8 cases per 1,000 households. The West Midlands (11.7 cases per 1,000 households), Yorkshire and the Humber (11.5) and the East Midlands (10.8) also had high rates of prevention and relief. The East of England, with 6.8 cases per 1,000 households, had the lowest rate.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the national non-domestic rates collected by local authorities in England in 2011-12 were announced on 15 August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2007-08 to 2011-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The net rate yield (after allowances for changes in respect of previous years and reliefs) increased by 9.1 per cent to £21.0 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The contribution to the pool (net rate yield after allowances for collection costs including losses) also increased by 9.2 per cent to £20.7 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between 2007-08 and 2011-12 the contribution to the pool from the local lists increased by £3.5 billion or 21 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London accounts for 29 per cent of the contribution to the national pool while having only 15 per cent of the population.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Fire incidents response times: England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication and accompanying data tables were released on Wednesday 4 July 2012 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. The publication focuses on trends in average response times at England level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics in this release are the latest figures available for England and relate to periods up to 31 March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="response-times"&gt;Response times&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, the average response time to fires in dwellings was 7.2 minutes (10 seconds shorter than in 2010-11) and 7.9 minutes to fires in other buildings (5 seconds shorter than in 2010-11).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average response times in 2011-12 were higher than in 2001-02 by around 22 per cent for dwelling fires and by around 29 per cent for fires in other buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="severity-of-fires"&gt;Severity of fires&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average, improvements in fire safety and prevention have greatly outweighed the effect of longer average response times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, there were 54 per cent fewer fire non-fatal casualties and 34 per cent fewer fire fatalities than in 2001-02.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, the average area of damage in dwelling fires was 20 per cent lower than in 2001-02.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the collection rates for council tax and national non-domestic rates in England in 2011-12 were announced on 27 June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2007-08 to 2011-12 and updates those statistics previously released on 29 June 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local authorities in England collected £22.1 billion in council taxes by the end of March 2012 out of a total of £22.7 billion collectable. This gave a national average in-year collection rate for council tax in England of 97.3 per cent in 2011-12, no change over 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities in England collected £20.8 billion in non-domestic rates by the end of March 2012 out of a total of £21.3 billion collectable. This gave a national average in-year collection rate for non-domestic rates in England of 97.8 per cent in 2011-12, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points over 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over the last four years, the national collection rate for council tax has increased by 0.2 of a percentage point. In the same period the national collection rate for national non-domestic rates has fallen by 1.0 percentage points.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average collection rate of non-domestic rates fell in all regions in the period 2007-08 to 2011-12; the largest fall, 1.9 percentage points, occurred in the North West.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the forecasts of national non-domestic rates to be collected by local authorities in England were announced on 23 May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2008-09 to 2012-13 and updates those statistics previously released on 25 May 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The yield before reliefs in respect of 2012-13 will be £1.5 billion or 6.3 per cent higher than in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is estimated that the contribution to the pool from the local lists is expected to increase by 5.1 per cent to £21.3 billion in 2012-13.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between 2008-09 and 2012-13 the contribution to the pool from the local lists is expected to have increased by £2.6 billion or 14 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London accounts for 29 per cent of the contribution to the national pool while having only 15 per cent of the population.&lt;/li&gt;
