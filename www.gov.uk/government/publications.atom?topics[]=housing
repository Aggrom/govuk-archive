    <title>Offering suitable housing to homeless people</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act 2011 enables local authorities to end the main homelessness duty by arranging an offer of suitable accommodation in the private rented sector, without requiring the applicant’s agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed draft Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2012 sets out those circumstances in which accommodation used for the private rented sector offer to end the main homelessness duty is not to be regarded as suitable.  It also looks at how best to strengthen requirements in relation to location and suitability, when local authorities secure accommodation for the use of households owed duties under the homelessness legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>A better deal for mobile home owners</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes a number of reforms to the park homes sector, aimed at tackling a number of complaints made by residents of some mobile home site operators. These can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking an owner’s sale of their home - without justifiable reason&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;charging excessive pitch fees, breaching site rules and stopping owners from improving their homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are designed to ensure site operators who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already whilst the rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring compliance with site licence conditions by enabling the courts to impose unlimited fines on operators who do not manage their sites properly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing local authorities to make a reasonable charge on site operators for their licensing services, which they are currently unable to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving local authorities the power to carry out works on sites in an emergency or where the site operator has been found guilty of a breach of the licence, and charge the cost back to them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening the rules around the sale of mobile homes so that unscrupulous operators cannot interfere with owners selling to a qualifying buyer who they have chosen; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changing legislation to improve other residents’ rights to reflect their status as home owners by, for example, allowing them to carry out home improvements without seeking permission.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Changes to the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness Regulations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2588/made"&gt;The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 8 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulations amend &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1294/contents/made"&gt;The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006&lt;/a&gt; in order to maintain the Government’s policy on eligibility for social hog and homelessness assistance in relation to non European Economic Area nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; is making these amendments following a ruling in the Court of Justice of the European Union in the case of Zambrano (C-34/09).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department wrote to chief housing officers about the new regulations on 17 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Reinvigorating Right to Buy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/housingstrategy2011"&gt;Laying the Foundations: A Housing Strategy for England&lt;/a&gt;, published on 21 November 2011, the government announced its intention to increase the caps on Right to Buy discounts, to encourage more tenants to take up the Right to Buy. It also sets out the government’s commitment to ensure that the receipts on every additional home sold under the Right to Buy are used to fund replacement, on a one for one basis, with a new home for Affordable Rent. This consultation sets out our proposals for how this will be achieved and seeking views on a number of questions relating to the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very keen to hear the views of local authorities and voluntary transfer housing association landlords on our  proposals. We would also encourage social landlords to engage with their tenants so that they are aware of these proposed changes, and can give early consideration to taking up this opportunity under the Right to Buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Homelessness changes in the Localism Act 2011: supplementary guidance</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supplementary guidance explains the changes sections 148 and 149 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/part/7/chapter/1/crossheading/homelessness/enacted"&gt;Localism Act&lt;/a&gt; make to the homelessness legislation. It explains in practice how the new power, that allows private rented sector offers to be made to end the main homelessness duty, should work and what local authorities should do as a consequence of the new power’s introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance also explains the requirements of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2601/contents/made"&gt;Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2012&lt;/a&gt;. The Order requires local authorities to put in place arrangements to ensure that the private rented sector offer accommodation that is suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance supplements parts of the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homelessness-code-of-guidance-for-councils-july-2006"&gt;‘Homelessness code of guidance for local authorities’&lt;/a&gt; published in July 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

The offence covers squatting in all residential buildings. It protects homeowners and lawful occupiers who discover squatters have occupied their homes.

    <title>Homelessness prevention and relief: England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an official statistics release on homelessness prevention and relief in England that took place outside the homelessness statutory framework in 2011 to 2012. This is the 4th year for which figures on homelessness prevention and relief have been published by the Department for Communities and Local Government under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the previous three releases were badged as ‘experimental’ official statistics in recognition that this is a relatively new data series, DCLG statisticians judge that the response rates and the quality of the figures received for 2011-12 have now improved enough for the ‘experimental’ label to now be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, a total of 199,000 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases, 174,800 (88 per cent) were preventions and 24,200 (12 per cent) were cases of relief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the total number of cases of homelessness prevention or relief increased by 5 per cent when compared to 2010-11. This is due to prevention cases increasing by 7 per cent, whilst cases of relief decreased by 2 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, 57 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 43 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home. This has not changed since 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the most common action taken to prevent or relieve homelessness was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation. In 2011-12, 27,600 cases (14 per cent) were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation this way, though this was a decrease of 10 per cent compared to 2010-11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the amount of homelessness prevention and relief activity varied across the regions. The North East had the highest rate of cases of prevention and relief with 11.8 cases per 1,000 households. The West Midlands (11.7 cases per 1,000 households), Yorkshire and the Humber (11.5) and the East Midlands (10.8) also had high rates of prevention and relief. The East of England, with 6.8 cases per 1,000 households, had the lowest rate.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Making every contact count: A joint approach to preventing homelessness</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness, we promised to bring government departments together to ensure that all of Whitehall was playing its part in tackling homelessness. Our first report rightly focused on the most visible end of homelessness - those coming onto the streets, often facing advanced and overlapping problems such as offending, drug and alcohol addiction or mental health problems. We have made significant progress since then, driving forward the national roll out of the innovative rough sleeping approach called ‘no second night out’ and investing an extra £70 million through the sector to help tackle homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report we turn our attention up stream to think about how services can be managed in a way that prevents all households, regardless of whether they are families, couples, or single people, from reaching a crisis point where they are faced with homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round 2 of the Homelessness Transition Fund was announced by the charity Homeless Link on 16 August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics report on the period April to June 2012 and update those previously released on 17 May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seasonally adjusted house building starts in England stood at 21,540 in the June quarter 2012. This is 10 per cent lower than in the March quarter 2012&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;completions (seasonally adjusted) also fell, down 6 per cent to 29,470 in the June quarter 2012&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;private enterprise housing starts (seasonally adjusted) were 7 per cent lower in the June quarter 2012 than the previous quarter, whilst starts by housing associations were 23 per cent lower&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seasonally adjusted private enterprise completions fell by 5 per cent and housing association completions fell by 11 per cent from the previous quarter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seasonally adjusted starts are now 27 per cent above the trough in the March quarter 2009 but 54 percent below the December quarter 2005 peak. Completions are 39 per cent below their March quarter 2007 peak&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;annual housing starts totalled 98,670 in the 12 months to June 2012, down by 10 per cent compared with the year before. Annual housing completions in England reached 118,330 in the 12 months to June 2012, an increase of 8 per cent compared with the previous 12 months&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Mortgage arrears and possessions: forecasts</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2012 DCLG commissioned Professor Muellbauer, of Oxford University, to update his model which forecasts repossessions and loans in arrears in the UK and to produce updated forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research report sets out the changes to the model since the last report and the revised forecasts. This update led to the inclusion of an extra eight observations, together with a number of data revisions. The update also means that the forecast of loans in arrears and repossession now draws upon a range of economic forecast scenarios based mainly on underlying forecast data from the Office for Budget Responsibility but also from Oxford Economics for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new forecasts represent an improved outlook for both repossessions and arrears compared to the previous forecast. The main reason being the change in interest rate expectations; interest rates are now expected to rise much later; in mid 2013, instead of early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
