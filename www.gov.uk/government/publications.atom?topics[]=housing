    <title>Affordable housing starts and completions funded by the HCA and the GLA - April to September 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics on affordable housing starts and completions funded by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and the Greater London Authority (GLA) were released on Friday 16 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures show the supply of homes delivered under the accelerated land disposal programme, the 2011-15 affordable homes programme (including the affordable homes programme, empty homes, homelessness change, mortgage rescue and traveller pitch funding), the economic assets programme, firstbuy, the get Britain building programme, the kickstart housing delivery programme, the national affordable housing programme and the property and regeneration programme. Details about these programmes can be found in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;HCA Housing statistics release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 3,735 affordable housing starts on site delivered in England through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents an increase of 678 per cent compared to the 480 (revised) started in the same period of the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 11,432 affordable housing completions delivered through programmes through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents a decrease of 11 per cent compared to the 12,778 completed in the same period in the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on the number of affordable homes delivered under the HCA affordable housing programmes is published twice a year. From April 2012, the Mayor of London has had strategic oversight of housing, regeneration and economic development in London. This means that the HCA no longer publish affordable housing starts and completions for London and this responsibility has been taken over by the GLA. DCLG combines data from the HCA and the GLA to publish six monthly affordable housing starts and completions delivered nationally under the affordable housing programmes of the HCA and GLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the HCA affordable housing statistics, see their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>House building in England: July to September 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on house building in England were released on 15 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics in this release present figures on new build housing starts and completions in England. Figures for the UK and constituent countries are also available in the accompanying tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics report on the period July to September 2012 and update those previously released on 16 August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted house building starts in England increased by 18% and stood at 25,760 in the September quarter 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted completions fell, down 7% to 27,060 in the September quarter 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private enterprise housing starts (seasonally adjusted) were 15% higher in the September quarter 2012 than the previous quarter, whilst starts by housing associations were 23% higher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted private enterprise completions fell by 6% and housing association completions fell by 14% from the previous quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted starts are now 52% above the trough in the March quarter 2009 but 45% below the December quarter 2005 peak. Completions are 44% below their March quarter 2007 peak.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Annual housing starts totalled 98,020 in the 12 months to September 2012, down by 9% compared with the year before. Annual housing completions in England reached 117,190 in the 12 months to September 2012, an increase of 6% compared with the previous 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Social housing sales in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of existing social housing stock in England for 2011 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social housing sales include sales under right to buy, preserved right to buy, right to acquire, social homebuy, other outright or shared equity sales to tenants, and sales of existing stock to the private sector. The figures exclude sales through low cost home ownership schemes where these do not relate to existing social stock, i.e. sales of newly built homes for shared ownership or acquisitions of private sector homes for affordable home ownership. Intra-tenure transfers between social housing providers are also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 9,670 total social housing sales in England in 2011-12. This is an increase of 15% on 2010-11 but continues the low level of sales seen since 2008-09. The increase was entirely due to an increase in private registered provider sales; local authority sales were virtually unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 3,720 right to buy sales in England in 2011-12 (38% of all sales), a 1% increase from 2010-11. Most (70%) right to buy sales were of local authority properties. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average market value of a local authority property purchased through right to buy in 2011-12 was £100,040. Average capital receipts were £73,350 and the average discount was £26,690 per property. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Registered provider sales in 2011-12 included 140 properties sold through the right to acquire scheme (compared to 200 in 2010-11) and 40 through social homebuy (compared to 110 in 2010-11).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 3,320 sales (34% of total sales) were disposals of registered provider properties to the private sector. Other shared equity and outright sales of existing stock accounted for the remaining sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate to right to buy sales by local authorities and registered providers. The statistics include sales under the right to buy and preserved right to buy schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Right to buy sales in England: 2012 to 2013 - quarters 1 and 2</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of dwellings under the right to buy scheme, as well as providing statistics on receipts resulting from those sales, and starts on site as part of the one-for-one replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 444 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 1. In this quarter local authorities received £24 million from right to buy sales, while 14 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 1,043 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 2. In this quarter local authorities received £62 million from right to buy sales, while 234 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate only to sales by local authorities under the right to buy scheme, excluding sales by registered providers under preserved right to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The regulations amend &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1294/contents/made"&gt;The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006&lt;/a&gt; in order to maintain the Government’s policy on eligibility for social hog and homelessness assistance in relation to non European Economic Area nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; is making these amendments following a ruling in the Court of Justice of the European Union in the case of Zambrano (C-34/09).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department wrote to chief housing officers about the new regulations on 17 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Homelessness changes in the Localism Act 2011: supplementary guidance</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supplementary guidance explains the changes sections 148 and 149 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/part/7/chapter/1/crossheading/homelessness/enacted"&gt;Localism Act&lt;/a&gt; make to the homelessness legislation. It explains in practice how the new power, that allows private rented sector offers to be made to end the main homelessness duty, should work and what local authorities should do as a consequence of the new power’s introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance also explains the requirements of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2601/contents/made"&gt;Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2012&lt;/a&gt;. The Order requires local authorities to put in place arrangements to ensure that the private rented sector offer accommodation that is suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance supplements parts of the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homelessness-code-of-guidance-for-councils-july-2006"&gt;‘Homelessness code of guidance for local authorities’&lt;/a&gt; published in July 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Affordable housing supply in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics on gross affordable housing supply in England were released on Thursday 1 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 57,950 gross additional affordable homes were supplied in England in 2011-12. This is a decrease of 4% on the 60,430 (revised) affordable homes supplied in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;37,540 new affordable homes were provided for social rent in 2011-12, a decrease of 3% on 2010-11. A further 930 new affordable homes were provided for affordable rent in 2011-12, the first year for which this scheme has run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;19,490 homes were provided through intermediate housing schemes, including shared ownership and shared equity, down by 10% on 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were 52,880 new build affordable homes provided in 2011-12, representing 91% of all affordable homes provided in 2011-12 compared to 88% of total supply in 2010-11. This was the highest percentage reported since before 1991-92.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12, 88% of affordable homes were in receipt of funding through the Homes and Communities Agency (excluding homes delivered under Section 106 without grant), a reduction from 92% in 2010-11. Around 92% of these were new build homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note: These statistics were assessed by the United Kingdom Statistics Authority in June 2011 (Report 117). We have addressed the requirements relating to these statistics to the satisfaction of the UK Statistics Authority and they are now accredited as National Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Our first report rightly focused on the most visible end of homelessness - those coming onto the streets, often facing advanced and overlapping problems such as offending, drug and alcohol addiction or mental health problems. We have made significant progress since then, driving forward the national roll out of the innovative rough sleeping approach called ‘no second night out’ and investing an extra £70 million through the sector to help tackle homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report we turn our attention up stream to think about how services can be managed in a way that prevents all households, regardless of whether they are families, couples, or single people, from reaching a crisis point where they are faced with homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round 2 of the Homelessness Transition Fund was announced by the charity Homeless Link on 16 August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Homelessness prevention and relief: England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an official statistics release on homelessness prevention and relief in England that took place outside the homelessness statutory framework in 2011 to 2012. This is the 4th year for which figures on homelessness prevention and relief have been published by the Department for Communities and Local Government under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the previous three releases were badged as ‘experimental’ official statistics in recognition that this is a relatively new data series, DCLG statisticians judge that the response rates and the quality of the figures received for 2011-12 have now improved enough for the ‘experimental’ label to now be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, a total of 199,000 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases, 174,800 (88 per cent) were preventions and 24,200 (12 per cent) were cases of relief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the total number of cases of homelessness prevention or relief increased by 5 per cent when compared to 2010-11. This is due to prevention cases increasing by 7 per cent, whilst cases of relief decreased by 2 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, 57 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 43 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home. This has not changed since 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the most common action taken to prevent or relieve homelessness was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation. In 2011-12, 27,600 cases (14 per cent) were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation this way, though this was a decrease of 10 per cent compared to 2010-11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the amount of homelessness prevention and relief activity varied across the regions. The North East had the highest rate of cases of prevention and relief with 11.8 cases per 1,000 households. The West Midlands (11.7 cases per 1,000 households), Yorkshire and the Humber (11.5) and the East Midlands (10.8) also had high rates of prevention and relief. The East of England, with 6.8 cases per 1,000 households, had the lowest rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Mortgage arrears and possessions: forecasts</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2012 DCLG commissioned Professor Muellbauer, of Oxford University, to update his model which forecasts repossessions and loans in arrears in the UK and to produce updated forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research report sets out the changes to the model since the last report and the revised forecasts. This update led to the inclusion of an extra eight observations, together with a number of data revisions. The update also means that the forecast of loans in arrears and repossession now draws upon a range of economic forecast scenarios based mainly on underlying forecast data from the Office for Budget Responsibility but also from Oxford Economics for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new forecasts represent an improved outlook for both repossessions and arrears compared to the previous forecast. The main reason being the change in interest rate expectations; interest rates are now expected to rise much later; in mid 2013, instead of early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>English housing survey household report: 2010 to 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government published the English Housing Survey (EHS) Household Report 2010-11 on Thursday 5 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the detailed report of findings from the survey relating to households, and builds on results reported in the English Housing Survey Headline Report published in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English Housing Survey Homes Report 2010, formally known as the Housing Stock Report, was also published on 5 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English Housing Survey began in April 2008 bringing together two former DCLG housing surveys - the English House Condition Survey and the Survey of English Housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report includes the following findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest tenure type in 2010-11 was owner occupation, with 14.45 million households (66 per cent). This continued a slight downward trend from a peak of 14.79 million households in owner occupation (71 per cent) in 2005. The private rented sector continued to increase in size, to 3.62 million households (17 per cent).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Owner occupiers buying with a mortgage made average weekly mortgage payments of £143. This compared to average weekly rent payments of £160 made by privately renting households, and £79 by social renters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;59 per cent of private renters and 23 per cent of social renters said they expected to buy a home in the UK, at some point. Of these, 16 per cent had considered applying for a mortgage in the last 12 months. Recent first time buyers were 6 per cent of owner occupiers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were two million recently moving households in 2010-11, compared to 1.8 million in 2009-10. Of these, 62 per cent were private renters, 22 per cent were owner occupiers and 16 per cent were social renters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Households living in poverty were more likely to live in homes that had significant outstanding repairs and damp problems than households who were not living in poverty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The majority of households were satisfied with their local areas and their accommodation. However, although the majority of people felt their areas had not changed much over the previous two years, across all tenures, they were more likely to say their local area had got worse than better.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>English housing survey homes report: 2010</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government published the English Housing Survey (EHS) Homes Report 2010, formally known as the Housing Stock Report, on Thursday 5 July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the detailed report of findings relating to the housing stock from the survey, and builds on results reported in the English Housing Survey Headline Report published in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English Housing Survey Household Report 2010-11 was also published on 5 July 2012.
The English Housing Survey began in April 2008 bringing together two former DCLG housing surveys - the English House Condition Survey and the Survey of English Housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report includes the following findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2010, there were 22.4 million dwellings in England. Some 66 per cent of these were owner occupied and the rest were rented, split fairly evenly between the private rented sector (17 per cent) and social rented sector (17 per cent). There were slightly more housing association dwellings (2 million) than local authority dwellings (1.8 million).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some 52% of the private rented stock was built before 1945 including 40 per cent built before 1919. Also, 15 per cent of private rented homes were converted flats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The total cost of dealing with basic disrepair (day to day maintenance) within the stock was around £31.8 billion at 2010 prices and the average cost of this type of disrepair was £1,418 per dwelling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proportion of dwellings with damp problems fell from 10 per cent in 2001 to 7 per cent in 2010. This was mainly due to a fall in the incidence of problems caused by penetrating damp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average energy efficiency rating for the whole stock (using SAP09) has increased from 45 in 1996 to 55 in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average SAP rating in the social sector in 2010 was around eight points higher than either owner occupied or private rented homes (62 compared with 54).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excel files below include annex tables and the tables and figures for each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
