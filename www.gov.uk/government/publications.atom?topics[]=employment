    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this new status, employee owners will receive shares between £2,000 and £50,000 which will be exempt from capital gains tax.

Individuals will also need to give longer notice to return from maternity leave or adoption leave. &lt;/p&gt;
