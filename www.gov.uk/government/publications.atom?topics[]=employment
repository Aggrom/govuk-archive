    <title>The business case for equality and diversity: a survey of the academic literature</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Looks at the evidence for the business case for equality and diversity in private sector organisations.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report sets out the findings from a systematic review of the literature on the business case for equality and diversity. It was commissioned by the Department for Business Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) and the Government Equalities Office (GEO). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report aims to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve understanding of theoretical positions and issues related to the business case for equality and diversity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;develop a consistent framework for assessing evidence on the business case&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;within this framework, review the evidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a compendium of the evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research assesses the most robust evidence, draw implications from the findings and present a dispassionate picture of the evidence identifying gaps and conflicting messages. The report looks at diversity in terms of ‘protected characteristics’ that are defined in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents"&gt;Equality Act 2010&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
