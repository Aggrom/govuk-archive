    <title>Greater freedom for local councils to prevent unauthorised traveller sites</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Proposals to give councils more freedom to stop unauthorised traveller sites have been published for consultation.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councils would be given greater freedom to stop unauthorised traveller sites being set up and prevent long, drawn-out stalemates like Dale Farm, under proposals published for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/changes-to-temporary-stop-notices-consultation"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="temporary-stop-notices"&gt;Temporary Stop Notices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals would allow councils greater freedom to use temporary stop notices in relation to caravans that are in breach of planning control, and are used as a person’s main residence. This would be backed up with the potential for heavy fines of up to £20,000 on indictment or an unlimited fine on summary conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the current system councils are constrained as to when they can use these powers against caravans that are main residences, which can result in long delays and high costs to stop unauthorised development of this kind.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Brandon Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For too long a small minority have abused the planning system, often at the expense of local communities who are forced to put up with unauthorised development in their area. This government believes in fair play, with everyone abiding by the same rules. These proposals will assist local councils in taking effective action against those who don’t.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stronger-powers"&gt;Stronger powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temporary Stop Notices enable councils to take action with immediate effect against unauthorised development without having to wait three days for a Stop Notice, or 28 days for an enforcement notice to come into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject to the outcome of the consultation, today’s proposals would remove restrictions on the use of temporary stop notices so councils can act quickly against new unauthorised sites, and save on the costs of enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Planning practice guidance should be simpler</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>An external review of planning practice guidance has recommended rationalising advice and making it easier to use.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review group, lead by Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/external-review-of-government-planning-practice-guidance"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; practice guidance that explains statutory provisions, planning and the planning system but did not review planning policy. They were not tasked with revaluating green belt policy or other countryside protections, which continue to be safeguarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group found that the existing guidance is unwieldy in its current form and recommends that it be shorter but retain key elements, and be more accessible to be useful to everyone using the planning system. They stated that guidance is important to ensuring planning decisions are properly informed but should not place undue burdens on users of the planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group found that a vast range of materials are being considered guidance, and that ‘living documents’ intended to be updated on a regular basis had not been amended since publication.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-planning-practice-guidance"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; to consider the group’s recommendations was launched today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Taylor said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is very clear that the old way of doing things is no longer fit for purpose. We have made recommendations for a modern web-based resource that is clear, up-to-date, coherent and easily usable, not just by planners and developers, but the public too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m very grateful to the group for all the work they have done on this. We will carefully consider the report’s recommendations and I would urge other users of the planning system to have their say by responding to the consultation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review group consists of Simon Marsh, Andrew Whitaker, Trudi Elliott and Councillor Mike Jones. They are sitting as individuals and not representatives of their respective organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Taylor, Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, was author of the Taylor Review of Planning (Rural Economy and Affordable Housing - Living Working Countryside, 2008). He is chairman of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.housing.org.uk/"&gt;National Housing Federation&lt;/a&gt; which represents 1,100 housing associations across England, chairman of the St Austell Eco-Town Strategic Partnership and was, until recently, founder Chair of the Rural Coalition (representing 14 national organisations interested in the sustainable development of rural communities). He was MP for Truro and St Austell for 24 years from 1987, until he stood down at the 2010 general election.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Improving the energy efficiency of buildings and using planning to protect the environment</title>
    <category>Policy</category>
    <summary>We need to reduce carbon emissions from buildings and make sure that planning policies help to protect and improve the environment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009 buildings accounted for about 43% of all the UK’s carbon emissions. Buildings and other developments can also damage the environment, through poor waste management or inefficient use of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to reduce carbon emissions from buildings and make sure that planning policies help to protect and improve the natural and built environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have included policies in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; to explain how developments should be planned to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce carbon emissions from buildings, we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are requiring local planning authorities to make sure that new developments are energy efficient &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;will require all new homes to be zero carbon from 2016 and are considering extending this to include all other buildings from 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have introduced the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/tackling/green_deal/green_deal.aspx" title="Green deal"&gt;green deal&lt;/a&gt; to enable people to pay for home improvements over time using savings on their regular energy bills &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have improved &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/energy-performance-of-buildings" title="Energy Performance Certificates"&gt;Energy Performance Certificates&lt;/a&gt; to make them more informative and user-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/code-for-sustainable-homes" title="Code for sustainable homes"&gt;Code for Sustainable Homes&lt;/a&gt; which provides a single national standard for the design and construction of sustainable new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help protect trees we have simplified the system for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/tree-preservation-orders" title="Tree preservation certificates"&gt;tree preservation orders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also work with the 9 &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/aggregate-working-parties" title="Aggregate working parties"&gt;aggregate working parties&lt;/a&gt; who provide technical advice about the supply and demand for aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government is responsible for developing town and country planning policy and rules that affect the environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our policies on planning and the environment are set out in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment/supporting-pages/national-planning-policy-framework-and-the-environment" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt;, published in March 2012 following extensive public consultation. The framework is an important part of the government’s reforms to make the planning system less complex and more easy to understand, and to promote sustainable growth. It replaced and simplified a series of earlier planning policy statements and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the government’s policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects. We are updating the earlier environmental reports and undertaking further consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/abolition-of-regional-strategies"&gt;written ministerial statement&lt;/a&gt; made by Baroness Hanham on 25 July 2012 sets out the background and explains why the reports are being updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All EU member states must follow the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This requires that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all properties (homes, commercial and public buildings) must have an Energy Performance Certificate when sold, built or rented&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;larger public buildings must display a Display Energy Certificate &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all air-conditioning systems over 12kW must be regularly inspected by an Energy Assessor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The review group’s report makes recommendations as to the scope and form of practice guidance that should be provided in future by government to support effective planning; what new or updated practice guidance should be published, with clear priorities; and what guidance should be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Changes to Temporary Stop Notices consultation</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation on proposals to improve councils' power to tackle unauthorised development.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation is on the proposal to revoke Statutory Instrument 2005/206 under the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/206/contents/made"&gt;Town and Country Planning (Temporary Stop Notice)(England) Regulations 2005&lt;/a&gt;. The regulation currently restricts councils use of Temporary Stop Notices on unauthorised sites where a caravan is used as a main residence. This can discourage local councils from serving stop notices where it may be beneficial to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this consultation would give local councils greater freedom to make a decision on the basis of local circumstances and on whether serving Temporary Stop Notices in respect of caravans used as main residences is appropriate. It will remain for local councils to consider the consequences of taking enforcement action and whether the action is necessary and proportionate in the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
