    <title>Preventing and reducing piracy off the coast of Somalia  </title>
    <summary>UK counter-piracy activity off the coast of Somalia, and HMG advice to the shipping industry and travellers.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2008 there has been a sharp rise in attacks by pirates off the coast of Somalia on ships transiting the Gulf of Aden and  Indian Ocean. Armed gangs have been hijacking vessels and demanding ransoms for the  release of both vessels and crew. These attacks affect the peace and security of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the UK is playing a lead role in international operations aimed at stopping the pirates, and providing humanitarian and development assistance to Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure pirates (and the proceeds from piracy) are stopped, and that the shipping and travel industry can conduct its business as safely as possible, the UK is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting counter-piracy missions - &lt;abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"&gt;NATO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_48815.htm"&gt;Operation Ocean Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.eunavfor.eu/"&gt;NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Operations/Enduring-Operations/Middle-East/Combined-Task-Force-151"&gt;Combined Task Force 151&lt;/a&gt; in the Horn of Africa region, and supports the UK Maritime Trade Operation (run by the Royal Navy and based in the British Embassy in Dubai) - and provide humanitarian and development assistance to Somalia to counteract the root causes of piracy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting countries in the region to let seized pirates be prosecuted regionally - the UK has agreements in place with the Seychelles, Mauritius and Tanzania&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting Somalia in reducing poverty and to enhance stabilisation, peace building and reconciliation at national, regional and local levels. This supports our counter-piracy and counter-terrorism objectives by helping, over the longer term, to bring down the causes of piracy and terrorism and to prevent their continuation. The Department for International Development’s (&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;’s) 4-year £250 million Somalia programme will play a crucial role in achieving this outcome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting the shipping industry advice on self-protection measures on how to avoid, deter and delay pirate attacks, and through government  guidelines on the use of armed guards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing advice to travellers in the region so you ‘know before you go’ and can be aware of any risks in the area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting the recognition of Somalia’s Exclusive Economic Zone, which will help protect its natural maritime resources up to 200 nautical miles from its coastal baselines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leading efforts to undermine the piracy business model, including through establishing a Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Co-ordination Centre (&lt;abbr title="Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre"&gt;RAPPICC&lt;/abbr&gt;) in the Seychelles.  The &lt;abbr title="Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre"&gt;RAPPICC&lt;/abbr&gt; will target the leaders, financiers and enablers of piracy by building evidence packages for use in their prosecutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Piracy Ransoms Task Force was established by David Cameron in February 2012 for threatened countries to work together to reduce the threat of piracy and ransom payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK continues to work with the international community to provide humanitarian and development assistance. This helps to tackle the underlying causes of piracy: long term instability and lack of development in the Somali region.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is working with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the UN Development Programme (&lt;abbr title="UN Development Programme"&gt;UNDP&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the International Maritime Organization to develop sustainable livelihoods in coastal communities, which complements &lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;’s programme of building long-term and sustainable jobs and economic opportunities in Somalia.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of such work is the Sustainable Employment and Economic Development Programme, a joint project with &lt;abbr title="UN Development Programme"&gt;UNDP&lt;/abbr&gt; Somalia.  The programme is aimed at working to improve the livelihoods of various stakeholders in the fisheries sector in Puntland.  It will result in improved regulation and development through public-private partnerships, with the aim to create 20,000 long-term jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has lead responsibility in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia for working group one, whose focus is on regional capacity development and military engagement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="legislation"&gt;Legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval operations to counter piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia operate under the authority of the UN Security Council. Since 2008, the Security Council has passed a number of resolutions authorising military operations, the most recent of which is the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/604/21/PDF/N1160421.pdf?OpenElement"&gt;UN Security Council Resolution 2077&lt;/a&gt; (2012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm"&gt;UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)&lt;/a&gt; defines the act of piracy and provides the basis for the prosecution of piracy and maritime crime offences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Reducing barriers to international free trade</title>
    <summary>How the government is working to remove conditions which obstruct trading for UK companies</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all trade markets in the world are entirely open to UK business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries set import restrictions or impose conditions which make life difficult for UK firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deal with &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-barriers-to-international-free-trade--3/supporting-pages/helping-uk-business-overcome-trade-barriers" title="trade barriers"&gt;trade barriers&lt;/a&gt; by either talking directly to the country which has put up a barrier, or by talking to them via the EU (in some cases we do both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is taking part in the negotiation of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-barriers-to-international-free-trade--3/supporting-pages/international-trade-agreements" title="trade agreements"&gt;international trade agreements.&lt;/a&gt; Through our membership of the EU, we’ve signed a free trade agreement with South Korea. This will make it easier for British companies to do business there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-single-market-centre" title="UK Single Market Centre"&gt;UK Single Market Centre&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the occasional problems UK companies can have trading in some EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government continues to make sure that agreements about international trade are good for poorer countries. For example, through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.aidfortrade.org.uk/" title="Aid for Trade"&gt;Aid for Trade&lt;/a&gt; fund and other ‘trade and development’ projects, we’re contributing to projects that will make it easier for developing countries to do business with other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out our strategy on trade and investment in the white paper, ‘Trade and Investment for Growth’, published in February 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white paper sets three goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to create opportunities for UK business to trade and invest overseas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to attract investment to the UK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to strengthen international trading links and help developing countries benefit from trade and investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe aiming to achieve these goals should increase international opportunities for British trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Working with the Overseas Territories on the challenges they face and encouraging strong local economies.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a broad responsibility to support the Overseas Territories and to ensure their security and good governance. Britain and territory governments share significant challenges: building more diverse and resilient economies; cutting public sector deficits; regulating finance businesses effectively; and protecting biodiversity and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-overseas-territories-programme-fund"&gt;The Overseas Territories Programme Fund&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overseas Territories Programme Fund supports the work of government to maintain the security, stability and prosperity of the Overseas Territories. This fund supports the economic, security, environmental and governance strategies in the government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/publications/overseas-territories-white-paper-0612/ot-wp-0612"&gt;white paper on the Overseas Territories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Where-we-work/Overseas-Territories/"&gt;Department for International Development (&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; provides budgetary support for Montserrat, Pitcairn and St Helena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/ovseas-terr-dept-2011.pdf"&gt;Department for International Development’s Operational Plan 2011-2015&lt;/a&gt; explains how money is allocated to the territories and how expenditure is monitored for effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="environment-and-climate-fund-darwin-plus"&gt;Environment and climate fund: Darwin Plus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government launched &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/10/17/2-million-a-year-overseas-territories-fund/"&gt;Darwin Plus: Overseas Territories Environment and Climate Fund&lt;/a&gt;, an environment and climate fund for the UK’s Overseas Territories, in October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fund consists of contributions from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (&lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;DEFRA&lt;/abbr&gt;), and &lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;. The fund will disburse around £2 million per year dedicated to a range of environment and climate-related projects to improve long-term natural resource management in the Overseas Territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guidance and application forms for the fund are available on &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;DEFRA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://darwin.defra.gov.uk/news/2012-10/darwin-plus/%20%E2%80%9CDarwin%20Initiative%E2%80%9D"&gt;Darwin Initiative website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="protecting-the-overseas-territories"&gt;Protecting the Overseas Territories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the UK’s main military tasks is to provide security to the nation and its overseas territories. The Ministry of Defence (&lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;) published a security policy in 2011, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/1AD4AFE6-4946-4BAC-A3A6-7AFBF9AA25BF/0/overseas_territories.pdf"&gt;Overseas Territories: the Ministry of Defence’s contribution&lt;/a&gt;, which explains how the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; will protect the Overseas Territories from 2012 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="supporting-the-public-sectors"&gt;Supporting the public sectors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have set up the Jubilee Programme to share experience between public servants in the territories and the UK by giving territory officials opportunities to train and work with colleagues in the UK, and vice versa, encouraging long-term partnerships between the territories and public bodies in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overseas Territories are very diverse, with thousands of small islands, vast areas of ocean, but also, in Antarctica, land 6 times the size of the United Kingdom. They include one of the world’s richest communities, in Bermuda; the most remote community, in Tristan da Cunha and one of the smallest, with only 54 people living on Pitcairn Island. The total population of the territories is roughly a quarter of a million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 14 British Overseas Territories and most have a permanent resident population. The exceptions are the British Indian Ocean Territory and the British Antarctic Territory, and South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, of which the latter have research stations. The Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus have a resident population of Cypriot nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14 Overseas Territories are:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Controlling defence, security and dual-use strategic exports</title>
    <summary>Regulating exports of military and dual-use equipment and technology to help ensure global security</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wide range of items including goods designed for a military purpose and some commercial goods are controlled under export licence legislation administered by the Export Control Organisation (ECO), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). ECO also regulates the export of certain dual-use goods - commercial items that have the potential to be used for military purposes or terrorism. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;components from the aviation or telecommunications industries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;certain chemicals &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;information security products like encryption software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;radioactive materials &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECO also regulates the export of goods that could be used for capital punishment, torture, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as well as other goods suject to sanction or embargo such as imports or Iranian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are exporting or trading in controlled items you will require a licence issued by the ECO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a licence is required depends on various factors such as whether the items are listed on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items"&gt;UK Strategic Export Control Lists&lt;/a&gt;, subject to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weapons-of-mass-destruction-wmd-end-use-control"&gt;End-Use Controls&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions"&gt;arms embargoes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk"&gt;apply for a licence using SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="goods-passing-through-the-uk"&gt;Goods passing through the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECO applies the same rules to goods passing through UK ports or airports (transit and trans-shipments) as to exports from the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="trade-outside-the-uk"&gt;Trade outside the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECO also controls the trade in certain &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-controls-on-controlled-military-goods"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/brokering-trade-of-dual-use-items"&gt;dual-use&lt;/a&gt; items outside the UK, if a UK citizen or UK company is involved. This regulation is known as ‘trade controls’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="end-use-control"&gt;End-use control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ECO suspects any commercial goods (even if not listed on the Control Lists) will be used for the production of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or for other military purposes, it can make them licensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="taking-decisions-on-export-licence-applications"&gt;Taking decisions on export licence applications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Export Control Organisation (ECO) assesses export licence applications for controlled strategic exports. We assess each application against the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/assessment-of-export-licence-applications-criteria-and-policy"&gt;Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria&lt;/a&gt;. The government updates the law on export and trade controls regularly to reflect changes in the Government’s foreign and security policy and international development goals. For information about these changes subscribe to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol"&gt;Notices to Exporters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECO is part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). ECO works with other government departments as part of the licence decision making process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These departments include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) – on human rights issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ministry of Defence (MOD) – on military capability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Department for International Development (DFID) - on development issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) – on energy, nuclear and chemicals issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also work with industry trade associations like the Export Group for Aerospace and Defence (EGAD) and JETSECC, a policy forum on legislation with particular emphasis on dual-use exports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enforcing-our-decisions"&gt;Enforcing our decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Border Force (BF) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) work together to enforce the UK’s strategic export and trade controls and sanctions and embargoes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMRC has a policy unit which develops and manages enforcement policy. Staff at HMRC’s National Clearance Hub undertake checks on customs export and import declarations and supporting documentation – including checking BIS export licences – to ensure appropriate risk assessment is undertaken.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Border Force officers carry out physical examinations of cargo at ports and airports to detain, disrupt and seize unlicensed or sanctions-breaching goods.  These seizures can result in criminal investigations by HMRC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If exports of military or dual use goods are detected without an export licence, this may result in a prosecution being brought through the Central Fraud Group within the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Independent studies including the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Assurance/Fraud-Investigation---Dispute-Services/11th-Global-Fraud-Survey---Driving-ethical-growth---new-markets--new-challenges" title="11th Global Fraud Survey"&gt;11th Global Fraud Survey&lt;/a&gt; by Ernst &amp;amp; Young and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/forensic-accounting-dispute-consulting-services/business-case-anti-corruption-programme.jhtml" title="Confronting corruption"&gt;Confronting Corruption&lt;/a&gt; by Price Waterhouse Cooper have shown that UK business is losing out overseas because of other companies’ bribery and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bribery and corruption are barriers to trade and growth. Overseas corruption makes it harder – and more expensive – for UK firms to do business abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve strengthened the law. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents" title="Bribery Act 2010"&gt;Bribery Act 2010&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 1 July 2011. It created a number of new offences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bribing a foreign official&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving or promising an advantage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;receiving, requesting, or agreeing to receive an advantage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;failure of a company to stop a bribe being paid on its behalf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve issued practical advice and guidance on bribery overseas for UK companies. This includes &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/legislation/bribery" title="Prevent bribery"&gt;guidance on procedures to prevent bribery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.sfo.gov.uk/media/167348/bribery_act_2010_joint_prosecution_guidance_of_the_director_of_the_serious_fraud_office_and_the_director_of_public_prosecutions.pdf" title="SFO guidance"&gt;guidance from the Serious Fraud Office&lt;/a&gt; on how they might prosecute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is also a part of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oecd.org/daf/briberyininternationalbusiness/anti-briberyconvention/oecdworkinggrouponbriberyininternationalbusinesstransactions.htm" title="OECD working group"&gt;OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC"&gt;UN Convention against corruption&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the G20 anti-corruption working group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also sponsor a website on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.transparency.org.uk/" title="Transparency International"&gt;dealing with international corruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our trading partners – including China and Russia - are now passing laws against foreign corruption. Canada had its first foreign bribery case in 2011. Australia had its first prosecution in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We brought in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents" title="Bribery Act 2010"&gt;Bribery Act 2010&lt;/a&gt; to support international trade by encouraging free and fair competition in business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Working for peace and long-term stability in the Middle East and North Africa</title>
    <summary>The British government's humanitarian and diplomatic efforts in securing peace in the Middle East and North Africa.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle East and North Africa (&lt;abbr title="Middle East and North Africa"&gt;MENA&lt;/abbr&gt;)  is highly important to the UK. The change begun by the Arab Spring could bring a more open, inclusive and democratic society. This would be the greatest gain for human rights and freedom since the end of the Cold War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Middle East and North Africa"&gt;MENA&lt;/abbr&gt; is home to some of the most long-running and high-profile foreign policy issues in the world, including the current Syria crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Middle East and North Africa"&gt;MENA&lt;/abbr&gt; matters for our prosperity, too. Trade between the UK and &lt;abbr title="Middle East and North Africa"&gt;MENA&lt;/abbr&gt; exceeded £30 billion in 2011, and millions of British tourists visit the region each year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="response-to-the-arab-spring-the-arab-partnership"&gt;Response to the Arab Spring: the Arab Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arab-partnership-programme-approach-2011-15"&gt;Arab Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a joint Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Work-with-us/Funding-opportunities/partnerships/Arab-Partnership/"&gt;Department for International Development (&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;) plan&lt;/a&gt;, the government is providing support for political and economic reform in &lt;abbr title="Middle East and North Africa"&gt;MENA&lt;/abbr&gt;, helping the people of the region  build more open and accountable societies. This includes diplomatic support, working with international institutions like the G8 and EU, and £110 million over 4 years to help finance locally-led reform projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ongoing-support-in-libya"&gt;Ongoing support in Libya&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, together with international partners including the UN and the EU, is providing a range of assistance to the new Libyan government including strategic and practical advice and training in the security and justice sectors, support to improve economic and financial governance, and capacity building for the now flourishing Libyan civil society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has allocated approximately £5 million to a wide range of civil society projects since August 2011, including human rights training for lawyers and the judiciary. The money is used to fund projects that, for example, promote the participation of young people in the political transition process, support women’s rights groups which aim to secure women’s rights, and train former fighters to be domestic election observers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="finding-an-end-to-the-crisis-in-syria"&gt;Finding an end to the crisis in Syria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is working with international partners to bring about an end to violence and achieve a managed political transition. We have already committed over £50 million to help &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/News/Latest-news/2012/Syria-crisis/"&gt;alleviate the humanitarian crisis&lt;/a&gt; and help the Syrian people prepare economically and politically for a new government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-middle-east-peace-process"&gt;The Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be resolved through direct negotiations between the parties and urge both sides to avoid undermining the prospects for peace by working towards starting direct negotiation without pre-conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stabilising-yemen"&gt;Stabilising Yemen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK is providing Yemen with £196 million from 2012 to 2015. Most of this money will go to alleviate humanitarian suffering and to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://sfd.sfd-yemen.org/index.php"&gt;Social Fund for Development&lt;/a&gt; to improve rural infrastructure and expand social protection. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/yemen"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt; is supporting&lt;/a&gt; Yemen’s long-term development, stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arab Spring has shown that demands for political and economic freedom will spread widely by themselves, not because Western nations advocate these values, but because all people everywhere aspire to these freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/prime-minister%E2%80%99s-speech-to-the-national-assembly-kuwait/"&gt;speech to the National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in Kuwait on 22 February 2011, the Prime Minister set out the UK’s approach to the Arab Spring, upholding universal values, rights and freedoms, with respect for the different cultures, histories and traditions of the countries in the region.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Increasing the UK’s exports and attracting inward investment</title>
    <summary>Helping businesses increase their exports and making the UK more competitive.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inward investment into the UK economy created or secured more than &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/aboutukti/item/344820.html"&gt;112,000 jobs in 2011 to 12&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to help double the UK’s exports to £1 trillion by 2020 and attract more inward investment in UK infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are determined to remain one of the top countries for ease of doing business, by providing more support for British businesses to export their goods and services, and reducing corporation tax to competitive levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment’s (&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/301280.html"&gt;Passport to Export&lt;/a&gt; is an assessment and skills-based programme that gives new and inexperienced exporters the training, planning and ongoing support needed to succeed overseas. Passport to Export also helps companies to research, visit and select markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British businesses can carry out export marketing research on all the major aspects of any export venture using &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/howwehelp/exportmarketingresearchscheme.html"&gt;Export Marketing Research Scheme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/109254.html"&gt;Export Communications Review&lt;/a&gt; gives companies impartial advice on language and cultural issues to improve their competitiveness in export markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/corporate_tax_reform_part1a_roadmap.pdf"&gt;simplifying and reducing corporation tax&lt;/a&gt; to encourage inward investment. The reduction to the rate of 24% means that the UK now has the lowest main rate in the G7 and the fifth lowest in the G20. We plan to reduce the rate to 21% from April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt; established the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/ukadvisorynetwork.html"&gt;UK Advisory Network&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 to provide high-quality and trusted support to investors setting up in the UK and UK companies doing business overseas through closer working between the government and the private sector. The network makes access to private sector expertise easier and more effective and allows those experts to share knowledge and market information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;FCO’s Business Charter&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2011, shows how FCO resources can meet the needs of British business. It is part of the FCO’s work to create lasting prosperity for the UK, explaining the specific contribution that the FCO makes to support business across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="www.ukti.gov.uk"&gt;&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has an ongoing programme of research that looks into the effect of exporting on UK companies across the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/download/160040/4/68420_EET_Acc_Access.pdf.html"&gt;Bringing home the benefits: how to grow through exporting&lt;/a&gt; found that for many UK companies the decision to grow through exporting has been profitable. Those companies who venture into new export markets tend to be rewarded both directly through boosted turnover, and indirectly through improved levels of efficiency, innovation and credibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/download/160040_117340/New%20markets,%20new%20ideas.pdf.html"&gt;New markets, new ideas: How exporting fosters innovation and growth&lt;/a&gt; suggests that many British companies are embracing a new era of internationalisation. This can be seen in both an increasing number of companies doing business overseas and the rising number of firms that export from an early stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also investigates the benefits business experience as a result of exporting including increased levels of growth, productivity and innovation. More young companies are grabbing international opportunities from an early stage; almost one in five (17%) new companies currently active abroad are classified as ‘Born Global’ - so have been doing business overseas since the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many internationalised firms experience a ‘virtuous circle’ where exporting led to innovation, and where those innovations then led to further exporting. Over half of all firms (53%) said that a new product or service evolved because of their business overseas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strengthening UK relationships in Asia, Latin America and Africa to support UK prosperity and security</title>
    <summary>Opening up new markets for secure trade and investment with British businesses.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic and political weight is shifting east and south. This means that fast-growing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa are essential to our interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to increase Britain’s prosperity and security by improving links with the economic and political powers of tomorrow. We are helping these markets grow so UK business can enjoy the mutual benefits of trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has already reallocated resources to boost the UK’s presence in the fastest-growing parts of the world. Ministers across government are planning their overseas travel strategically to meet influential politicians, business and community leaders in the fastest-growing parts of the world, and host them when they visit the UK. These meetings concentrate on building links, including trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emerging Powers Fund launched in autumn 2012, supporting projects to the value of £1.8 million over 3 years to build links with the fastest-growing parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prosperity Fund was launched in April 2011 so that the UK can create the conditions for sustainable global growth and development. In its first year the fund gave £19.4 million to 248 projects in 14 countries and regions to build links with the fastest-growing parts of the world. In 2012-2013, the fund is allocating £19 million in 15 countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment’s (&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;) new strategy, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/148300.html"&gt;Britain open for business&lt;/a&gt;, launched in May 2011, explains our plans to provide practical support to exporters and inward investors over 5 years, including winning high-value overseas opportunities for UK businesses. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;Business Charter&lt;/a&gt; launched alongside the &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s strategy, shows how the government supports UK business abroad, including in the fastest-growing parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every overseas post, Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (&lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;) staff undertake press and communications work, which includes building relations with local media, and communicating the advantages of investing in and trading with the UK. A small London-based team works with the 1,700 London-based international media to ensure they understand the UK’s economic strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; operates websites in 53 local languages around the world, which attract 10 million visitors every year. These platforms are used to champion the UK’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since publishing the white paper on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/international-trade-investment-and-development/docs/t/11-717-trade-investment-for-growth.pdf"&gt;Trade and investment for growth&lt;/a&gt;  in February 2011, the government has: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supported businesses to secure more than £800 million of high-value opportunities overseas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helped more than 20,000 small and medium-sized enterprises to export and break into new high-growth markets like India, China, Brazil and Turkey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched new export finance products to support smaller businesses to sell their products abroad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced Strategic Relationship Management for large UK exporting firms and important inward investors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked with the World Trade Organisation to agree Russia’s accession, after 18 years of negotiations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade and investment for growth white paper: &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade-white-paper-progress-and-achievements-in-year-1"&gt;Progress and achievements in year one&lt;/a&gt; explains the progress made against the commitments in that white paper as part of the government’s effort to rebalance the UK economy through trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Business Charter&lt;/a&gt;, launched in May 2011, describes the support the &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; provides to British businesses, helping them to identify and pursue new opportunities overseas, manage risks and build relationships abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charter was launched alongside the &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s 5-year strategy, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/148300.html"&gt;Britain open for business&lt;/a&gt;, which explains how the government is generating growth through trade and supporting exporters and inward investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Promoting stability throughout the Western Balkans</title>
    <summary>Securing peace and creating the conditions for EU membership in the Western Balkans.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1990s saw the violent break-up of the former Yugoslavia and the beginning of the transition from communism in the region. The region has since started the long route to greater stability and prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stability in the Western Balkans matters; the region is on Europe’s doorstep and instability or conflict would affect the UK, including through migration and organised crime. The UK is therefore working to reduce the risk of conflict in the region, promote stability and reconciliation, and support reforms, as the region moves towards future EU and NATO membership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK is a strong supporter of future EU and NATO membership for all countries of the Western Balkans (along with Iceland and Turkey). To reach this future in the EU and NATO, countries need to meet conditions for membership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU accession process, leading to membership, requires serious reform efforts from the region, including on rule of law, organised crime and corruption, public administration, and economic reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is supporting these reforms with £3 million of Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) programme funds for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia (and Turkey), for example funding judicial reform or media freedom projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is also providing expertise supporting accession-related reforms from across the civil service as part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.twinning.org/en/page/the-european-union.html"&gt;EU twinning programme&lt;/a&gt;, means to help people understand the aims of the EU, to develop a stronger sense of European identity, and to bring the EU closer to its citizens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reforms reduce security threats to the UK and promote a strong environment for British business interests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconciliation is crucial for the region, following the conflict and atrocities of the past. Cooperation with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.icty.org/"&gt;International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, the UN court of law dealing with war crimes that took place during the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s, remains important, as does the leadership in the region openly and honestly acknowledging the events of the past, such as the genocide in Srebrenica. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is also supporting conflict prevention efforts in the region, with around £10 million provided jointly from the FCO, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development. The work is focused on Bosnia and Herzegovina and on Kosovo and includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK troops joining, in December 2012, the regional reserve for the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support for the Srebrenica prosecutions team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK judges hearing war crime cases in Kosovo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;projects to support ethnic minorities returning to rebuilt homes following the Kosovo war&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK continues to support safeguards against instability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ohr.int/"&gt;Office of the High Representative&lt;/a&gt;, the international institution responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the Peace Agreement ending the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK works as part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.euforbih.org/"&gt;EUFOR Althea peacekeeping operation&lt;/a&gt;, the EU’s military operation that launched on 2 December 2004 and has contributed to the maintenance of the safe and secure environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="albania"&gt;Albania&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albania is already a member of NATO and has made an application for EU membership. The UK encourages further progress on reforms, particularly rule of law and democracy, for Albania to move forward on towards their EU future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bosnia-and-herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK remains wholly and actively committed to Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign, stable country with functioning state-level institutions. Significant political progress is needed if progress towards NATO and EU membership is to be made, but such progress will bring benefits to citizens throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia will accede to the EU in July 2013. The European Commission’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2012/package/hr_rapport_2012_en.pdf"&gt;Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Croatia’s state ofpreparedness for EU membership&lt;/a&gt;, published in October 2012, noted the progress made by Croatia in its preparations for accession. The commission also identified a number of areas where further improvements are necessary in order to fully meet all membership requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06327"&gt;Croatia Accession Bill&lt;/a&gt; would allow the UK to ratify Croatia’s accession treaty. All existing EU member states must ratify the accession treaty before Croatia can join the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK recognised Kosovo’s declaration of independence in February 2008 and is a longstanding supporter of Kosovo’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The UK is a firm supporter of a stable, prosperous and multi-ethnic Kosovo making progress towards eventual EU and NATO membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK supports Macedonia’s progress towards EU and NATO membership. Since March 2002, the European Commission has reported regularly to the EU Council and Parliament on progress made by the countries of the Western Balkans region. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2012/package/mk_rapport_2012_en.pdf"&gt;2012 report&lt;/a&gt; describes the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in preparing for EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="montenegro"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/fule/headlines/news/2012/06/20120629_en.htm"&gt;Montenegro opened accession negotiations&lt;/a&gt; with the EU in June 2012. The UK supports an early focus on rule of law issues in the negotiations, notably strengthening the judiciary and tackling organised crime and corruption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="serbia"&gt;Serbia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK is a long-standing supporter of Serbia’s EU future and welcomed Serbia becoming an official EU candidate in March 2012. We urge Serbia to make further progress normalising its relations with Kosovo in order to meet the criteria for opening accession negotiations with the EU. Domestic reforms and regional cooperation remain important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Countering weapons proliferation </title>
    <summary>Securing global safety by preventing countries and terrorists access to the materials needed for weapons of mass destruction.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread of weapons of mass destruction (&lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;) poses a threat to the UK and the international community. Indiscriminate trade in conventional arms and the use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (&lt;abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear"&gt;CBRN&lt;/abbr&gt;) weapons and ballistic missiles raises serious humanitarian and security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working around the world to champion and implement UK policies as set out in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-counter-proliferation-strategy-2012-2015"&gt;National Counter-Proliferation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the spread of &lt;abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear"&gt;CBRN&lt;/abbr&gt; weapons and ballistic missiles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK works with international partners and through organisations such as the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt;, G8, NATO and the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; to reduce terrorists’ ability to create, obtain or use &lt;abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear"&gt;CBRN&lt;/abbr&gt; materials and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="counter-proliferation-programme"&gt;Counter-Proliferation Programme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the FCO’s tools to combat these threats is our &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/countering-weapons-proliferation/supporting-pages/counter-proliferation-programme"&gt;Counter-Proliferation Programme&lt;/a&gt;. In the financial year 2012 to 13, the value of the programme is £3 million. This funding is used to support projects around the world which increase political will or technical capacity to reduce the threat of weapons proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="national-counter-proliferation-strategy"&gt;National Counter-Proliferation Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government published its &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-counter-proliferation-strategy-2012-2015"&gt;National Counter-Proliferation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; in March 2012. The strategy’s main aims are to deny terrorists the materials and expertise to make and use &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;; to stop countries such as Iran and North Korea from obtaining &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt; or advanced conventional weapons; and to build up the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.iaea.org/About/"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency (&lt;abbr title="International Atomic Energy Agency"&gt;IAEA&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; and other organisations and treaties that help us meet our goals through the international community and which help to protect global security and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="chemical-weapons"&gt;Chemical weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK supports the destruction of remaining chemical weapons stocks and works to encourage full national implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (&lt;abbr title="Chemical Weapons Convention"&gt;CWC&lt;/abbr&gt;) by all countries. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/countering-weapons-proliferation/supporting-pages/the-chemical-weapons-convention"&gt;Chemical Weapons Convention&lt;/a&gt; bans the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="biological-weapons"&gt;Biological weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has signed up to the global implementation of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/%28httpPages%29/04FBBDD6315AC720C1257180004B1B2F?OpenDocument"&gt;Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (&lt;abbr title="Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention"&gt;BTWC&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of the convention is to help prevent states acquiring or keeping biological and toxin weapons, and prevent them ever being used by states or terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention"&gt;BTWC&lt;/abbr&gt; doesn’t have a verification system like that of the &lt;abbr title="Chemical Weapons Convention"&gt;CWC&lt;/abbr&gt;. Participating countries are required to submit relevant data and declarations, or confidence-building measures, to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs. This increases openness and gives participating countries confidence that others are complying with the convention. The UK’s confidence building measures are published on the the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/%28httpPages%29/CEC2E2D361ADFEE7C12572BC0032F058?OpenDocument"&gt;Implementation Support Unit website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="nuclear-weapons"&gt;Nuclear weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working-towards-nuclear-disarmament"&gt;working towards nuclear disarmament&lt;/a&gt;. The UK is one of 189 states that have signed the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/countering-weapons-proliferation/supporting-pages/nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (&lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. The treaty aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and ultimately eliminate them. The &lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt; has three equally important ‘pillars’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to work towards non-proliferation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to champion nuclear disarmament &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to encourage the peaceful use of nuclear energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="nuclear-security"&gt;Nuclear security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK will continue work to strengthen international nuclear security including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;securing fissile material in Kazakhstan, in a joint project with the US &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; to build a central store for spent radioactive sources in Ukraine  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping to create new jobs for 3,000 former weapons scientists in Russia and other former Soviet Union countries  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assisting many other countries through our collaboration with the &lt;abbr title="International Atomic Energy Agency"&gt;IAEA&lt;/abbr&gt; on its Nuclear Security Fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue to offer funding and expertise for physical nuclear security upgrades and help support the strongest possible security.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are supporting the full implementation of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/328/43/PDF/N0432843.pdf?OpenElement"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; Security Council Resolution 1540&lt;/a&gt;, which requires all states to refrain from supporting non-government agents from developing, acquiring, manufacturing, possessing, transporting, transferring or using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their delivery systems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="state-programmes"&gt;State programmes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the international legal framework, conventions and treaties, some countries have active programmes to develop and produce &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;. Of particular concern is Iran’s nuclear programme; the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme and willingness to provide weapons to other countries; and Syria’s possession of chemical and biological weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK works through various international organisations to seek peaceful means to reduce the threat from these programmes and the networks that support them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="arms-trade-treaty"&gt;Arms Trade Treaty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a legitimate arms trade, there is also an urgent need for more effective and coherent international regulation of that trade. The UK is working to achieve an international arms trade treaty to provide clearer and more effective control of the illegal arms trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; conference in July 2012 was unable to adopt an Arms Trade Treaty (&lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt;). However, the UK will continue to play a leading role in future negotiations to help to secure one. An &lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt; will help to reduce the flow of weapons from legitimate trade to the illicit market.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further details on the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; process towards an &lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt; and submissions from states (including the UK’s views on an &lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt;) are available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/ga/first/63/documentation.shtml"&gt;United Nations General Assembly website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="export-licensing"&gt;Export licensing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has joined other governments around the world to pursue &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/3849543/eu-arms-export"&gt;collective implementation of export controls&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the proliferation of &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;. The 4 main export control regimes are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mtcr.info/english/index.html"&gt;Missile Technology Control Regime&lt;/a&gt;, which controls the proliferation of missile systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/Leng/default.htm"&gt;Nuclear Suppliers Group&lt;/a&gt;, which controls the supply of nuclear related technologies and materials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.australiagroup.net/en/index.html"&gt;Australia Group&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to ensure that exports do not contribute to the development of chemical or biological weapons &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.wassenaar.org/"&gt;Wassenaar Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;, which promotes greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read further details about the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-non-proliferation-and-arms-control-regimes"&gt;international non-proliferation and arms control regimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s regulatory authority responsible for assessing and issuing strategic export licences to UK exporters is the Export Control Organisation (ECO), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Read more about the UK’s policies and procedures for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/controlling-defence-security-and-dual-use-strategic-exports--2"&gt;controlling defence, security and dual-use strategic exports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (&lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt;) was borne out of fear that the Cold War era would lead to a nuclear arms race and is still the basis of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. All states are now party to it apart from India, Israel, Pakistan and South Sudan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt; provides for a Review Conference every 5 years, both to review developments over the previous 5 years and to look ahead to the future. At the last &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2010/"&gt;Review Conference in 2010&lt;/a&gt; a series of action plans were agreed to enhance implementation of the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.iaea.org/"&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; was set up as the world’s ‘Atoms for Peace’ organisation in 1957 within the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; family, and supports the &lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt;. The agency is at the centre of international efforts to address Iran’s nuclear dossier and to ensure the benefits of safe and secure peaceful nuclear energy are accessible to everyone, not just to the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.thenuclearsecuritysummit.org/eng_main/main.jsp"&gt;Seoul Nuclear Security Summit&lt;/a&gt; assembled 53 countries, the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt;, the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, the &lt;abbr title="International Atomic Energy Agency"&gt;IAEA&lt;/abbr&gt; and Interpol, to continue work to secure vulnerable nuclear material around the world within 4 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 December 2008 in the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; General Assembly, 133 States voted in favour of a draft resolution ‘Towards an Arms Trade Treaty’. There was a clear majority view that, working together, the international community can shape an Arms Trade Treaty into an effective legally binding mechanism to regulate the international trade in arms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our detailed guides on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/sanctions-embargoes-and-restrictions"&gt;Sanctions, embargoes and restrictions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions"&gt;Current arms embargoes and other restrictions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (&lt;abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy"&gt;CFSP&lt;/abbr&gt;), the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; applies restrictive measures in pursuit of the specific &lt;abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy"&gt;CFSP&lt;/abbr&gt; objectives set out in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/index.htm"&gt;Treaty on European Union&lt;/a&gt; (see particularly Article 11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/sanctions/index_en.htm"&gt;&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; External Action website&lt;/a&gt; provides an overview of restrictive measures adopted in the framework of the &lt;abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy"&gt;CFSP&lt;/abbr&gt; that are currently in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/list_compend.shtml"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; Security Council Sanctions Committees website&lt;/a&gt; contains links to the latest versions of all &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; Security Council targeted sanctions lists. The individuals and entities included in these lists are subject to the relevant measures imposed by the Security Council, and all member states are obliged to implement these measures. Each separate list is maintained by the relevant Security Council Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
