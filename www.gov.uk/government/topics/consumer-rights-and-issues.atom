    <title>Providing better information and protection for consumers</title>
    <summary>How the government is changing some laws to help consumers</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government believes that consumers who are well-informed about their rights and what they’re buying are more confident and more likely to spend money. We also think that consumers who feel properly protected by the law are more likely to spend money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to give consumers more confidence - and legal back-up - to deal with bad service or shoddy goods. We also want to encourage consumers to spend money, as this will help the economy grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="consumer-bill-of-rights"&gt;Consumer bill of rights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We intend to simplify and clarify consumer law with a new bill (Act of Parliament). This will contain a clear list of rights for consumers, along with new measures to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/consumer-bill-of-rights" title="Consumer bill of rights"&gt;Consumer bill of rights&lt;/a&gt; will also contain remedies for when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="consumer-and-competition-landscape-reform"&gt;Consumer and competition landscape reform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘consumer landscape’ is the network of organisations that help consumers - Citizens Advice, for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘competition landscape’ is the network of organisations that deal with competition issues and anti-competitive activities in business – the Office of Fair Trading, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re planning to reorganise both the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/consumer-and-competition-landscape-reform" title="consumer and competition landscapes"&gt;consumer and competition landscapes&lt;/a&gt; between now and 2014, to make them both simpler to understand and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementing-the-consumer-rights-directive-201183eu"&gt;Implementing the Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/implementing-the-consumer-rights-directive-2011-83-eu" title="Consumer Rights Directive."&gt;Consumer Rights Directive (CRD)&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; measure. All &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; members have agreed to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRD gives consumers additional rights when buying in the UK and the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. We’re aiming to make the CRD part of UK law by June 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="misleading-and-aggressive-selling"&gt;Misleading and aggressive selling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/misleading-and-aggressive-selling" title="Misleading and aggressive selling."&gt;improving the rights of people who have been misled into buying something&lt;/a&gt;, or who have been pressured into buying something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="personal-data"&gt;Personal data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re helping consumers make better buying decisions by giving them improved access to the personal data companies hold about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/personal-data"&gt;midata project.&lt;/a&gt;. We’re working with business, consumer and privacy groups. The project is led by an independent data expert. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The midata project runs on a voluntary basis, but we’ll pass a law to make industry cooperation compulsory if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-buying"&gt;Community buying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers can combine their buying power to buy goods and services together. This can get them better deals. The government is supporting community buying in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by providing clear advice to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/community-buying" title="Community groups"&gt;community groups&lt;/a&gt; who want to get started&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by running the ‘Buy better together challenge’, which has a £60,000 fund to be shared amongst innovative collective purchasing projects - the challenge was won by Smarterbuys, an organisation that helps provide affordable loans to disadvantaged people so they can buy essential goods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="who-can-i-contact-for-help-and-advice"&gt;Who can I contact for help and advice?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t help with individual problems – but here are &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/consumer-protection-rights" title="Help and advice"&gt;some people who can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till now, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/" title="Trading Standards."&gt;Trading Standards&lt;/a&gt; have worked on mainly local cases and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://oft.gov.uk/" title="Office of Fair Trading."&gt;Office of Fair Trading&lt;/a&gt; (OFT) worked on some national ones. A National Audit Office (NAO) report was critical of this split and the ‘enforcement gap’ it caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/consumer-and-competition-landscape-reform" title="Consumer and Competition Landscape Reviews."&gt;Consumer and Competition Landscape Reviews&lt;/a&gt; were published in spring 2012. They recommended a number of changes including transferring the main responsibility for consumer advice to the Citizens Advice service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consulted in June 2011 with proposals for reforming consumer institutions – the ‘consumer landscape’. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/empowering-and-protecting-consumers?cat=closedwithresponse" title="Empowering and Protecting Consumers: Consultation"&gt;Empowering and protecting consumers&lt;/a&gt; had 184 responses and closed in September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted in summer 2012 about whether we should have an ‘order-making power’ for midata. This power would give us the legal authority to make businesses release personal data to their customers. Following the consultation, we announced that we would legislate if companies didn’t release customers’ data voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-937-enhancing-consumer-consultation-supply-of-goods-services-digital.pdf" title="proposals to update and simplify consumer law"&gt;proposals to update and simplify consumer law.&lt;/a&gt;  How would they affect consumers and businesses? That consultation closed on 5 October 2012. We’ll publish the results in spring 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-937-enhancing-consumer-consultation-supply-of-goods-services-digital" title="Goods, services, digital content"&gt;Consultation on the supply of goods, services and digital content (July 2012)&lt;/a&gt; here and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/s/12-961-supply-of-digital-content-impact.pdf" title="Impact assessments on the supply of goods, services and digital content."&gt;Impact assessments on the supply of goods, services and digital content here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/12-1008-consultation-ban-above-cost-payment-surcharges" title="Early implementation of a ban on above cost payment surcharges."&gt;Early implementation of a ban on above cost payment surcharges&lt;/a&gt; This closed on 15 October with the government response due in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/12-999-consultation-implementation-of-consumer-rights-directive.pdf" title="Consumer rights consultation"&gt;implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive&lt;/a&gt; This closed on 1 November. The government response is due in spring 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-543-enhancing-consumer-confidence-effective-enforcement-consultation.pdf" title="Consumer law enforcement powers"&gt;Simplifying consumer law enforcement powers.&lt;/a&gt; The government response is expected in spring 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re consulting on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/12-1193-civil-enforcement-remedies-consultation-on-extending" title="Extending the range of remedies available to public enforcers of consumer law."&gt;Extending the range of remedies available to public enforcers of consumer law&lt;/a&gt;. This opened on 2 November and closes on 31 December with government response due early in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to know your views on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/12-1193-civil-enforcement-remedies-consultation-on-extending"&gt;Give your views about extending the range of remedies available to public enforcers of consumer law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked with a number of partners to produce our ‘Guide for community buying groups’. All of the organisations below contributed or checked material for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action with Communities in Rural England (ACRE)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allen Valleys Oil Buying Co-operative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brighter Living Partnership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citizens Advice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Co-operatives UK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oxfordshire Rural Community Council&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The R Shop Bulk Buying Project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solar 100 Project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sustain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up2Us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also worked with the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, who both did studies on misleading and aggressive selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Making consumer credit markets fairer</title>
    <summary>The government wants to make sure that lenders treat borrowers fairly.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poorly regulated lenders and debt collectors can cause people problems or add to their problems when they borrow money or they’re in debt. People with debt problems can become vulnerable to unfair practices by credit or debt firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to make sure that lenders treat borrowers fairly. We also want to make the credit market itself fairer for all borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working to make borrowing money fairer and more transparent. For example, we’re working with finance trade associations to make it clearer how payday loans work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-consumer-credit-markets-fairer--6/supporting-pages/consumer-credit-markets" title="Consumer credit markets"&gt;Consumer credit markets&lt;/a&gt; will make it easier for people to get debt advice if they fall into money problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re proposing to move responsibility for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-consumer-credit-markets-fairer--6/supporting-pages/consumer-credit-regulation" title="Consumer credit regulation"&gt;consumer credit regulation&lt;/a&gt; from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in April 2014. We believe this will provide a more responsive organisation along with stronger consumer protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government published its response to the &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; select committee’s report on debt management in May 2012. We set out a number of actions relevant to the committee’s report. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transferring consumer credit powers from the OFT to the Financial Conduct Authority&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with payday loan trade associations to agree better protection for consumers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;holding an industry-wide meeting on debt management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/11-1341-consumer-credit-and-insolvency-response-on-credit.pdf" title="Consumer credit and personal insolvency review"&gt;Consumer credit and personal insolvency review&lt;/a&gt; finished in November 2011. The review suggested actions on unfair bank charges, store cards and the high cost credit market, many of which have since been taken forward in 2012.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Making it easier to trade</title>
    <summary>How the government is updating some of the older laws covering estate agents and street traders.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the laws designed to protect consumers are now so out of date that they’re hampering economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to simplify or repeal these laws without losing any that give consumers the protection they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="estate-agents"&gt;Estate agents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Estate Agents Act was written before the internet existed. Parts of the Act make it difficult to run some online property sites - the kind that puts buyers and sellers in touch with each other, but don’t offer personal advice. We’re changing the law to make trading easier for this kind of online business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be making these changes in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="street-traders"&gt;Street traders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the laws covering street traders date from the 19th century. This makes some of them unfit for the 21st century and they need to be updated. Additionally, new European regulations say the UK’s street trading laws are too complex. We need to make some changes to the law for street traders as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be making these changes in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2010 survey by the Office of Fair Trading found that, although many buyers use the internet as a way of looking for property, there wasn’t much choice for consumers who wanted to buy or sell a home without using an estate agent. The government felt that there was space in the market for new players to provide online property marketplaces for private sellers, as long as we made some changes to the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laws on street trading and pedlary are part of retail law. This means they come under the EU’s European Services Directive. As a result, we have to change any street trading or pedlary laws to meet the directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="estate-agents-1"&gt;Estate agents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/p/12-931-proposal-amend-estate-agents-act-1979.pdf" title="Encouraging new business models - proposal to amend the Estate Agents Act 1979"&gt;Encouraging new business models - proposal to amend the Estate Agents Act 1979&lt;/a&gt;     closed in August 2012. We published our response on 13 September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had over 400 responses from 271 different organisations and individuals. These included traditional estate agents, owners of online property sites, the National Association of Estate Agents, the National Federation of Property Professionals, Trading Standards offices and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="street-trading"&gt;Street trading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;England, Wales and Northern Ireland jointly opened a consultation on street trading laws on 23 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/s/12-605-street-trading-compliance-with-services-directive-consultation.pdf" title="Street Trading and Pedlary Laws"&gt;Street Trading and Pedlary Laws: consultation on draft regulations to ensure compliance with the requirements of the European Service Directive&lt;/a&gt; asks about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new definition of what a pedlar is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing people under 17 to trade as pedlars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;letting councils grant street trading licences for longer than 12 months&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taking away some local authority powers for refusing or revoking a street trading licence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation also contains a proposal to repeal the UK-wide Pedlars Acts to comply with the European Services Directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;

    <title>Buying Smarter Together</title>
    <summary>Better shopping deals for the consumer gets a boost as the winner of the UK Buy Better Together Challenge is announced.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;28 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Smarterbuys’ scheme, which helps provide affordable loans to disadvantaged people so that they can buy essential goods, has scooped the £15,000 Buy Better Together Challenge prize, presented by Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge was launched by BIS and Co-operatives UK in December 2011 to encourage groups of consumers to get together and negotiate discounted rates for buying goods and services in bulk. The Challenge received 110 entries, which were whittled down by a panel of independent judges to seven finalists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Fair Food Carlisle’ was awarded the runner-up prize for their scheme which uses buying groups to provide workplaces with a weekly supply of food from local businesses, winning £5,000 which will be invested in improving business processes and hiring staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event Jo Swinson said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;” The Buy Better Together Challenge has highlighted hundreds of fantastic ideas and examples from local communities, who banded together to make their money work harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Collective purchasing is of immense value to groups, not just to make cost savings, but to increase social links in the community and reach out to vulnerable consumers who may not have access to online research or internet shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The schemes we have heard about today aren’t just benefitting consumers though; businesses have seen first-hand how they can gain more customers by working with these groups and communities, often beating competitors in the process. Many congratulations are due to the organisers of ‘Smarterbuys’, which is a positive example of how collective purchasing can challenge existing markets and provide better results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And I also congratulate ‘Fair Food Carlisle’ in supporting local produce growers and taking an innovative approach to boosting their local food economy. These schemes are a clear example of what can be done when consumers are empowered and work together to get better deals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Street Trading and Pedlary Laws: A joint consultation on draft regulations to repeal the Pedlars Acts (UK wide) and make changes to the street trading legislation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</title>
    <summary>The UK Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Scottish Government are jointly consulting on proposals to ensure compliance with the requirements of the European Services Directive.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="background-to-consultation"&gt;Background to consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in our &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/s/11-542-street-trading-pedlar-laws-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government Response&lt;/a&gt; to the street trading and pedlary consultation, the Governments interpretation of compliance with the Directive developed in the course of the evaluation of the Directive amongst Member States. The consensus now is that the retail sale of goods is generally a service activity within the scope of the Directive and since pedlars and street traders are engaged in the retail sale of goods it has been concluded that changes are required to both of these regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="purpose-of-consultation"&gt;Purpose of consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the consultation is to ensure that the street trading and pedlary regimes comply fully with the requirements of the Services Directive.   The UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are seeking views from stakeholders in relation to the repeal of the Pedlars Acts and changes to their respective street trading regimes. The Scottish Government is only seeking views in relation to the repeal of the Pedlars Acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="areas-for-consultation"&gt;Areas for consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public views are being sought specifically in the following areas: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeal of the UK wide Pedlars Acts 1871 and 1881.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new, clear and up to date definition of what behaviour constitutes acting as a pedlar for the purposes of the pedlar exemption under the street trading regimes of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes to Schedule 4 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 to ensure compliance with the Services Directive - (the street trading regime of England and Wales).  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes to the Northern Ireland (Street Trading) Act 2001 to ensure compliance with the Services Directive.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
