    <title>Protecting the UK against terrorism</title>
    <summary>Preventing terrorist attacks on the UK, and on British people and businesses abroad.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a threat to the UK, British nationals and our interests abroad from terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of these threats come from outside the UK and cannot be resolved by concentrating efforts in the UK alone. The government is addressing these threats at their source overseas before they reach the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s Counter Terrorism Strategy, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter-terrorism/counter-terrorism-strategy/"&gt;CONTEST&lt;/a&gt;, reduces the risk from international terrorism so that people can go about their daily lives freely and with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is based on 4 main actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prevent: to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pursue: to stop terrorist attacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;protect: to strengthen our protection against terrorist attack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prepare: where an attack cannot be stopped, to mitigate its impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="prevent"&gt;Prevent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism in the UK and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;responding to the ideological challenge of terrorism and the threat we face from those who promote it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;preventing people from being drawn into terrorism and ensuring that they are given appropriate advice and support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation which we need to address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter-terrorism/prevent/prevent-strategy/"&gt;latest information on the Prevent strategy&lt;/a&gt; on the Home Office website. This includes the full text of the strategy and the outcomes of the Prevent review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="pursue"&gt;Pursue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/counter-terrorism/uk-counter-terrorism-strat/pursue/"&gt;Pursue&lt;/a&gt; strand of the strategy means working to detect and investigate terrorist networks and disrupt their activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving our ability to identify and understand the terrorist threat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disrupting terrorist activity and taking action to frustrate terrorist attacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bringing terrorists to justice through prosecution – this  includes strengthening the legal framework against terrorism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing international co-operation with partners and allies to strengthen our ability to work together to disrupt terrorist networks, for instance by using &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/protecting-the-uk-against-terrorism/supporting-pages/deportation-with-assurances"&gt;Deportation with Assurances&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="protect"&gt;Protect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/counter-terrorism/uk-counter-terrorism-strat/protect/"&gt;Protect&lt;/a&gt; strand means seeking to reduce the vulnerability of the UK and its interests overseas from terrorist attack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing accurate &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/"&gt;FCO travel advice&lt;/a&gt; on the threat from domestic and international terrorism, with advice for British companies abroad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting key foreign governments to develop their ability to protect areas such as aviation and maritime security, energy infrastructure, crowded places and ‘soft’ targets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="prepare"&gt;Prepare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/counter-terrorism/uk-counter-terrorism-strat/prepare/"&gt;Prepare&lt;/a&gt; strand means working to mitigate the impact of a terrorist attack where it cannot be stopped. This includes work to manage an ongoing attack and recover from its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preparing the FCO network to respond to terrorist attacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting foreign governments to develop their own ability to respond to terrorism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in technology by both terrorists and organised crime groups create challenges to our national security. The UK’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter-terrorism/science-and-technology/science-and-technology-strategy?view=Binary"&gt;Science and Technology Strategy for Countering International Terrorism&lt;/a&gt; uses innovation, science and technology to reduce the risk to the UK and its interests overseas from international terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Qaeda is weaker than at any time since 9/11. It has played no role in recent political change in North Africa and the Middle East. Its ideology has been widely discredited and it has failed in all its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued international pressure has further reduced its capability and the UK is working with other countries to weaken terrorist threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, al Qaeda continues to be a significant threat and other terrorist groups, some affiliated to al Qaeda, have become stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/counter-terrorism/"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for keeping the UK safe from the threat posed by terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The determination of the government and everyone involved in the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games was to create a safe and secure event that the UK and the world could enjoy. We thoroughly tested our plans to see how government departments, police and emergency services could respond to a range of incidents.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The games’ &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter-terrorism/olympics/olympic-safety-security-strategy?view=Binary"&gt;safety and security strategy&lt;/a&gt; has helped communities become more resilient to crime and the threat from violent extremism, and relationships between police and other security agencies have improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of a terrorist incident, the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism is responsible for activating and co-ordinating the Home Office response. We provide a crisis response 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. The government’s response to all kinds of emergencies, including terrorism, is set out in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.iaem.com/regions/iaemeuropa/documents/UKConOps.pdf"&gt;Central government arrangements for responding to an emergency: concept of operations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Preventing and reducing piracy off the coast of Somalia  </title>
    <summary>UK counter-piracy activity off the coast of Somalia, and HMG advice to the shipping industry and travellers.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2008 there has been a sharp rise in attacks by pirates off the coast of Somalia on ships transiting the Gulf of Aden and  Indian Ocean. Armed gangs have been hijacking vessels and demanding ransoms for the  release of both vessels and crew. These attacks affect the peace and security of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the UK is playing a lead role in international operations aimed at stopping the pirates, and providing humanitarian and development assistance to Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure pirates (and the proceeds from piracy) are stopped, and that the shipping and travel industry can conduct its business as safely as possible, the UK is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting counter-piracy missions - &lt;abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"&gt;NATO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_48815.htm"&gt;Operation Ocean Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.eunavfor.eu/"&gt;NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Operations/Enduring-Operations/Middle-East/Combined-Task-Force-151"&gt;Combined Task Force 151&lt;/a&gt; in the Horn of Africa region, and supports the UK Maritime Trade Operation (run by the Royal Navy and based in the British Embassy in Dubai) - and provide humanitarian and development assistance to Somalia to counteract the root causes of piracy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting countries in the region to let seized pirates be prosecuted regionally - the UK has agreements in place with the Seychelles, Mauritius and Tanzania&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting Somalia in reducing poverty and to enhance stabilisation, peace building and reconciliation at national, regional and local levels. This supports our counter-piracy and counter-terrorism objectives by helping, over the longer term, to bring down the causes of piracy and terrorism and to prevent their continuation. The Department for International Development’s (&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;’s) 4-year £250 million Somalia programme will play a crucial role in achieving this outcome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting the shipping industry advice on self-protection measures on how to avoid, deter and delay pirate attacks, and through government  guidelines on the use of armed guards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing advice to travellers in the region so you ‘know before you go’ and can be aware of any risks in the area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting the recognition of Somalia’s Exclusive Economic Zone, which will help protect its natural maritime resources up to 200 nautical miles from its coastal baselines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leading efforts to undermine the piracy business model, including through establishing a Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Co-ordination Centre (&lt;abbr title="Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre"&gt;RAPPICC&lt;/abbr&gt;) in the Seychelles.  The &lt;abbr title="Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre"&gt;RAPPICC&lt;/abbr&gt; will target the leaders, financiers and enablers of piracy by building evidence packages for use in their prosecutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Piracy Ransoms Task Force was established by David Cameron in February 2012 for threatened countries to work together to reduce the threat of piracy and ransom payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK continues to work with the international community to provide humanitarian and development assistance. This helps to tackle the underlying causes of piracy: long term instability and lack of development in the Somali region.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is working with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the UN Development Programme (&lt;abbr title="UN Development Programme"&gt;UNDP&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the International Maritime Organization to develop sustainable livelihoods in coastal communities, which complements &lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;’s programme of building long-term and sustainable jobs and economic opportunities in Somalia.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of such work is the Sustainable Employment and Economic Development Programme, a joint project with &lt;abbr title="UN Development Programme"&gt;UNDP&lt;/abbr&gt; Somalia.  The programme is aimed at working to improve the livelihoods of various stakeholders in the fisheries sector in Puntland.  It will result in improved regulation and development through public-private partnerships, with the aim to create 20,000 long-term jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has lead responsibility in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia for working group one, whose focus is on regional capacity development and military engagement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="legislation"&gt;Legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval operations to counter piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia operate under the authority of the UN Security Council. Since 2008, the Security Council has passed a number of resolutions authorising military operations, the most recent of which is the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/604/21/PDF/N1160421.pdf?OpenElement"&gt;UN Security Council Resolution 2077&lt;/a&gt; (2012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm"&gt;UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)&lt;/a&gt; defines the act of piracy and provides the basis for the prosecution of piracy and maritime crime offences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Typhoon jets arrive at RAF Northolt for Olympics role</title>
    <summary>Typhoon fighter jets arrived at RAF Northolt today to take part in a major military exercise to test security for the forthcoming London Olympic Games.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time fighter planes have been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jets’ arrival marks the start of specialist training which will result in increased flying activity over London and the Home Counties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codenamed Olympic Guardian, the nine-day exercise will put airmen, soldiers and sailors through their paces in the skies over the South East. The exercise runs from 2 to 10 May, and it is likely that people will notice an increase in highly visible air activity (particularly on 5 and 6 May).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise will test the procedures military aircrews will use to intercept and communicate with aircraft breaching restricted airspace during the Olympics, and the actions they must take in response. Pilots entering restricted airspace can expect to be intercepted by Typhoon fighters or military helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air security plan for the Olympic Games builds on the Royal Air Force’s existing defence of UK airspace, which includes round-the-clock radar surveillance and Typhoon fighters held at high readiness every day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise integrates the additional forces being used to ensure the safety of the Olympics, as part of the Ministry of Defence’s role to ensure a safe and secure Games this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the Typhoon fighters which arrived at RAF Northolt today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• RAF Puma aircraft - together with Royal Navy and Army Lynx helicopters - carrying teams of RAF Regiment snipers to intercept aircraft in restricted airspace, and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• airborne surveillance aircraft including RAF E-3D Sentry aircraft and Royal Navy Sea King ASaC (Airborne Surveillance and Control) helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An RAF Typhoon arrives at RAF Northolt" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4955/Typhoon_jets_arrive_at_RAF_Northolt_for_Olympics_role-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An RAF Typhoon arrives at RAF Northolt [Picture: Senior Aircraftman Steve Buckley, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the ground, the RAF is providing additional mobile ground radar systems (Type 101 radar), while the Army is deploying air observers and high velocity and Rapier missile systems, which also provide radar detection capability, to provide additional layers of radar coverage. A final decision on the deployment of these capabilities has yet to be taken by the Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no specific threat to the Games, we have to be ready to assist in delivering a safe and secure Olympics for all to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The fact that our state-of-the-art Typhoons will be stationed at RAF Northolt underlines the commitment of the Ministry of Defence and our Armed Forces to keeping the public safe at a time when the world will be watching us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Vice-Marshal Stuart Atha, Air Component Commander for Olympics Air Security, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we undertake this essential training, there will be a visible and audible presence of RAF Typhoon and military helicopters operating above Greater London and the Home Counties. There will also be flights occurring throughout the exercise period to allow pilots and other forces to become familiar with operating in the London and Home Counties airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have sought to limit the amount of flying to the minimum required to ensure that our Forces are ready for their important role delivering air security for the Olympics, balancing this against the need for us to reduce disturbance to a minimum. But we hope that people will understand the need for this very important training, and we thank them for their continued strong support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/parental-child-abduction-is-a-worldwide-problem"/>
    <title>Parental Child Abduction is a worldwide problem</title>
    <summary>New figures reveal that the number of parental child abduction cases dealt with by the Foreign Office has risen by 88% in under a decade.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year alone the Foreign Office’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/child-abduction/" title="International parental child abduction"&gt;Child Abduction Section&lt;/a&gt; fielded an average of four calls per day to its specialist advice line, more than half of which were new cases .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-worldwide-problem"&gt;A worldwide problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parental child abduction – where a parent takes a child without the permission of those with parental responsibility – is now a worldwide issue. In 2003/04 we worked on cases in 51 countries; now cases relate to 84 different countries, showing just how widespread the problem has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also fear that these statistics are just the tip of the iceberg; many cases go unreported as parents seek custody of their children through foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="raising-awareness"&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public understanding of parental child abduction is alarmingly low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research we commissioned shows that half the UK population believes the government can intervene to order the return of a child to the UK if he or she has been abducted by a parent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that whilst help is available, parental child abduction cases can take years to resolve. This has significant impact on those concerned and there is the strong possibility that the child may never be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also much harder to return a child from a country that has not signed the 1980 Hague Convention, an international agreement between certain countries which aims to ensure the return of a child who has been abducted by a parent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="legal-and-financial-reality"&gt;Legal and financial reality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite parental child abduction being against the law, a quarter (24%) of people do not think, or are unaware, that it’s a crime for a parent to take their child overseas without the consent of others with parental responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked which parent they thought was more likely to abduct a child, three quarters (74%) of people thought it was fathers. Yet according to statistics from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.reunite.org/" title="reunite"&gt;Reunite International Child Abduction Centre&lt;/a&gt;, 70% of the charity’s cases concern mothers taking the child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as this emotional distress, both parents may often face severe financial difficulties as they fight for custody of their child through foreign courts. The statistics show that people tend to underestimate just how much getting a child back costs, including legal fees overseas and in the UK which may continue to mount up even after  the child is returned to this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be a lack of awareness about who pays the costs of resolving a parental child abduction case involving a non-Hague country. Sixty-two per cent either didn’t know or responded with the wrong answer, and only 38% answered correctly by saying it was the parents who would pay, not the UK Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-expert-view"&gt;The expert view&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daisy Organ, head of the Foreign Offfice Child Abduction Section said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The increase in parental child abduction cases is a major cause for concern, particularly in the lead up to the school holidays; we know that before or during school holidays is one of the most common times for a child to be abducted. We hope that this campaign will help inform and educate the UK public and encourage parents thinking of abducting their child to think twice before they cause significant distress to themselves and their family. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Shalaby, Chief Executive of Reunite, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important to remember that parental child abduction is not faith or country specific. 71% of the UK public thought that parents most commonly abduct their children to the Middle East, India and Pakistan but it can happen to anyone, from any background. Countries where children are abducted to can range from Australia, to France, to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have seen a 20% increase in calls made to our helpline in the first half of 2012 compared to 2011  and a 67% increase in the number of children who have been abducted by a parent to a non-Hague country between 2001 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This issue is not going away and with a 47% increase in the number of child abduction cases Reunite has worked on between 2001 and 2011, we are urging parents to think twice before they abduct their child or seek help if they think their child is at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="contact-information"&gt;Contact information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned, or if your child has been abducted, you can call the FCO’s Child Abduction Section on 0207 008 0878 or visit &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/child-abduction/" title="Child Abduction Section"&gt;http://www.fco.gov.uk/childabduction&lt;/a&gt;, or Reunite on 0116 2556 234.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Piracy Ransoms Task Force publishes recommendations</title>
    <summary>Today the Piracy Ransoms Task Force presented its conclusions on how to work together to reduce the threat of piracy and ultimately ransom payments to pirates.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force was established by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, after the London Conference on Somalia in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14-nation Task Force, brought together policy makers from some of the world’s largest Flag States (countries where vessels are registered), nations whose seafarers are most commonly at risk, and those countries at the forefront of the military response to piracy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force made four recommendations in its final report to the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia in New York:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a new strategic partnership between Flag States, the private sector and law enforcement agencies that brings together those tackling piracy and those subjected to it in a united effort to break the piracy business model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a more co-ordinated approach to information-sharing to provide evidence to pursue and prosecute all involved in piracy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strengthen co-ordination between Flag States, the private sector and military responders to prepare for potential hostage situations; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage implementation of anti-piracy measures, including greater compliance with Best Management Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s conclusions from the Piracy Ransoms Task Force are a welcome step in the right direction. International action, led by the UK, is starting to beat back in the global fight against piracy. The dramatic reduction in pirate activity in the past year shows how important collective action is, and the recommendations of the Task Force should make it harder for pirates to receive, and to profit from, ransom payments. But seafarers of all nations remain at risk, and we must continue to work to break the piracy business model, with the ultimate ambition of bringing an end to ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK Government firmly supports and endorses the conclusions of the Piracy Ransoms Task Force. Only through the international community working together to break the pirates’ business model will we reach a position whereby pirates are no longer able to receive or profit from ransom payments. The Government will continue to work as a leading member of the Contact Group and with industry in taking forward the implementation of the task force’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Skiers: avoid injury and expensive medical bills</title>
    <summary>We urge winter sports holidaymakers to know their limits before hitting the slopes.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are launching a campaign aimed at Britons visiting European winter sports resorts this winter to explain the dangers of attempting slopes beyond your level of ability, or going off piste without the correct safety equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re heading off a ski or snowboarding holiday this winter, please don’t put yourself at risk by trying to keep up with more experienced members of your party. The number of reported accidents on French slopes in 2012 was high, including seven deaths out of 12 serious incidents*. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="research"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to new research from the FCO**, of those British nationals that go on winter sports holidays the majority class themselves as beginner or intermediate. Only 1% of respondents classed themselves as expert. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of winter sports travellers admitted they would ski or snowboard on slopes above their experience in order to stay with a group. More than half (53%) also said they would follow a group of mates off piste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventy per cent admitted they do not always wear a helmet when skiing or snowboarding, and one in five (21%) said they wouldn’t wear a helmet if others in their group weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Taylor, Consul, based in Marseille, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last year we saw a high number of British nationals end up in hospital with serious injuries. Sadly this included a number of deaths. Many of these accidents can be prevented by taking simple precautionary steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t make the mistake of assuming you’ll be fine if you’re with more experienced skiers or snowboarders. It is significant that a large number of cases we have dealt with have involved off piste skiing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those lucky enough to survive an accident and end up in hospital can face months of recovery, so it is important to think carefully beforehand about the very real risks out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="insurance"&gt;Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a third (38%) of winter sports holidaymakers admitted that they don’t always take out travel insurance. One in three (31%) also said they don’t always check their policy to ensure they are covered for winter sports activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Taylor continued:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many people will be unaware that failing to wear a helmet or skiing off piste can invalidate some insurance policies, so if something does go wrong you could end up with hefty medical bills. In many cases family members then have to help with funds which can put a huge strain on families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The FCO cannot pay for hospital treatment or for medical repatriation back to the UK, which is why it is so important to check your insurance covers you for everything you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="top-tips-to-stay-safe-on-the-slopes"&gt;Top tips to stay safe on the slopes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take out insurance – and check what it covers. It might not cover off piste skiing unless you are with a qualified guide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a check-up before you ski - one of the major causes of hospitalisation and death on the slopes is heart attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t drink and ski. Alcohol can affect you more quickly at high altitudes and dangerously limits your awareness of risk and cold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most skiing injuries are caused by collisions with other skiers – watch your speed and distance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t attempt slopes you’re not experienced or fit enough to tackle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to go off piste, go with a qualified guide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If going off piste carry a shovel, a probe and a transceiver in case of an avalanche. Also remember that you need proper training on how to use a transceiver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are going out on a glacier, you must wear a harness. If you fall into a crevasse, this will help the rescue team get you out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure someone knows where you’re going and tell them of any changes to your plans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only go off piste skiing or climbing with someone you have met previously and can trust. You need to know his/her capabilities, what you’ll be doing and where.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Figures taken from FCO 2011/12 consular assistance data &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Survey conducted by ICM. Total sample size was 2,023 UK adults aged 18 and over. Fieldwork was undertaken in November 2012. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all UK adults aged 18 and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council </title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister David Lidington has updated parliament on the Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council in a Written Ministerial Statement.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, and I will attend the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-russia-summit"&gt;EU-Russia Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the EU-Russia Summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. Whilst I do not expect conclusions to be issued, we will aim to ensure that this meeting, the 30th such summit, delivers concrete results for the EU in its relationship with Russia. The discussion provides an opportunity for the UK to steer the EU’s objectives for the Summit and to ensure discussion focuses on concrete achievable outcomes, such as: resolution of the Siberian overflight charges; movement on market reform; positive developments in the energy relationship; underlining Member States’ concerns on human rights and democratic standards; and a more effective Partnership for Modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="western-balkans"&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review the situation in the countries of the Western Balkans, in advance of the discussion of EU enlargement at the GAC the following day. This will be an opportunity to consider the latest developments in the EU-facilitated dialogue between the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo: the UK welcomes the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this and is keen to see further improvement in the relations between the two sides. There may also be some discussion of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the pace of reform has recently slowed and renewed progress is badly needed, as well as consideration of the situations in Macedonia and Albania. I do not expect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a discussion on Syria. Further to a UK drive to increase EU support to Syrian civil society, I anticipate that the EEAS will present its vision on how the EU can support civil society in coping with the consequences of the ongoing conflict and better prepare it for political transition. We also expect discussion on the relationship between EU Member States and the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. Having successfully amended the EU arms embargo (and sanctions package) by setting a three-month renewal period, we will make fresh arguments in support of amending the arms embargo ahead of the March 2013 deadline in a way that offers sufficient flexibility to increase practical support to the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may also take stock of recent events in Libya, including how to support the priorities of the new Prime Minister, Ali Zidan, and his government which has now taken office. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council may discuss events in Egypt following President Mursi’s 22 November Constitutional Declaration. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but we will argue for the EU to respond appropriately to the latest developments and clearly underline support for continued progress towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the Middle East Peace Process will focus on follow-up to the 29 November UN General Assembly Resolution, including the EU’s response to the Israeli decisions to build 3,000 new housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, to unfreeze planning in the area known as E1 and to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority. EU Ministers will also discuss facilitating a rapid return to credible negotiations in order to secure a two-state solution. We will reiterate our condemnation of the Israeli decision, underlining the threat this poses to the two-state solution, and stress the need to continue work to build on the May FAC conclusions. We will also emphasise the need for the US, with the strong and active support of the EU, to do all it can in the coming weeks and months to take a decisive lead and push the peace process forward urgently. Additionally the UK will stress the need to build on the Gaza ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons. The UK will support conclusions covering these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-us"&gt;EU-US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item has been re-scheduled from November’s FAC. Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama.  I expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy and a possible EU-US free trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
We also expect Ministers to agree conclusions on Ukraine and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council"&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a substantial agenda for the GAC in December. There is a legislative deliberation on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union; a presentation by the Commission on the Annual Growth Survey; Preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December; endorsement of the 18 month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece; and a discussion on Enlargement, covering all potential candidates and including the adoption of EU Common positions for the Accession Conference with Iceland. Due to the large agenda, I expect many of these items to be brief and I expect most of the discussion to focus on the preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December and on Enlargement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statute-of-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union"&gt;Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency hopes to secure agreement on a selection method for additional judges at the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union: we have not yet received the final proposal for this.  I remain concerned at the current backlog at the General Court, which is damaging to the interests of British business.  My priorities in the discussion will be: to ensure that there is proportionate common law representation among any additional judges; that the costs of additional judges are covered within existing budgets; and that the selection method provides the Court with the stability it requires to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-semester-and-the-annual-growth-survey"&gt;European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present key elements of the 2013 annual growth survey which can be found on the Commission’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual growth survey sets out the Commission’s views on the economic priorities for Europe for 2013, focusing on fiscal consolidation, promoting economic growth and employment. The survey, which represents the first stage of the 2013 European Semester, focuses on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures across the EU.  The European Semester is the EU-wide framework for coordinating structural reforms and growth-enhancing policies. We do not expect this item to be opened for substantive discussion but, in the event that it is, I will be supporting the focus on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-for-the-december-european-council"&gt;Preparation for the December European Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the December European Council will cover: economic policy, including Economic and Monetary Union and Banking Union; defence; enlargement; and foreign policy. The last two items are covered by the separate sections of this Written Ministerial Statement on enlargement and on the Foreign Affairs Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the European Council meeting will focus on agreeing a legislative framework for Banking Union and an agenda for further Economic and Monetary integration in the Eurozone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the December European Council the Prime Minister will seek to ensure the integrity of the Single Market at 27, including in the context of the Banking Union and the European Banking Authority. We will also press for further progress on growth and ensure that the timetable for further integration in the Eurozone progresses at the right pace and in the right way.  I will argue that these concerns should be addressed prior to the December European Council so that solutions to these issues can be put to leaders on 13 and 14 December.
The December European Council agenda item on defence will pave the way for further discussion in 2013.  I will argue for a focus on developing capabilities, enhancing operational effectiveness and strengthening the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-18-month-programme-for-the-presidencies-of-ireland-lithuania-and-greece"&gt;The 18-month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAC has been asked to endorse the 18-month programme of the Council. This sets out the combined programme for the Irish, Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies of the European Council covering the period January 2013 to June 2014. I expect the programme to be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enlargement"&gt;Enlargement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will seek to agree conclusions taking stock of progress on EU enlargement, and on the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans. The Commission released their Annual Enlargement Package on 10 October.  In this communication, the Commission recommended: (i) opening accession negotiations with Macedonia; and (ii) granting Albania candidate status subject to the completion of three specific measures and evidence of continued commitment in the fight against organised crime and corruption. We believe the communication to be a broadly fair and balanced assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek conclusions reconfirming the European Council’s support for EU enlargement and recognising that the accession process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform and reinforces peace, democracy and stability. We agree with the Commission’s view that closer relations with the EU should be based on the principles of delivery on commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality, and good communication with the public. We agree that key challenges remain for most enlargement countries, including in the area of the rule of law. We also support a focus on freedom of expression and regional co-operation, particularly for the Western Balkans countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out the Government’s views on the Commission’s reports in my explanatory memorandum of 18 October. We will seek Council conclusions welcoming Croatia’s continued progress towards meeting all of its commitments in full before its expected accession on 1 July 2013, while reiterating the Commission’s call for Croatia to sharpen its focus to ensure this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will seek conclusions that provide a fair and balanced assessment of Turkey’s progress, which will inject much needed momentum into the process to allow accession negotiations to move forward in 2013. I will argue that Iceland should be commended on the progress made in accession negotiations this year, while recalling the need for Iceland to address existing obligations, such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority under the European Economic Area Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also expect the Council to welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, while calling for early progress in the area of the rule of law, in line with the new approach to accession negotiations endorsed by the Council in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the FAC discussion of 10 December, the GAC will discuss the Commission’s enlargement package for the Western Balkans countries. We remain fully supportive of a future for all of the Western Balkans countries in the EU, once conditions are met. We want the European Council to commend good progress on reform in Macedonia through the High Level Accession Dialogue, and hope the European Council will be able to build on this by agreeing to the Commission’s fourth successive recommendation to open accession negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a further report from the Commission, the December European Council will not be in a position to grant candidate status to Albania; we will want it to call on Albania to make early progress on reform implementation and establish a track record on tackling organised crime and corruption to enable a decision in 2013. I will argue for Council conclusions that underline that Serbia still needs to make real progress to deliver a “visible and sustainable improvement” in its relations with Pristina before accession negotiations can be opened, while noting that this remains in reach if recent progress continues.  We want the Council to welcome the Commission’s assessment that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo is feasible and to signal that negotiations should begin as soon as possible.  We agree with the Commission’s assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on its EU agenda has stalled. We will want the Council to press the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress and deliver quickly on those issues they themselves have agreed to, for example, on the EU road map agreed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Monmouth sharpens skills for the Gulf</title>
    <summary>The ship's company of Royal Navy warship HMS Monmouth have been keeping themselves in shape and ready for operations in the Gulf while transiting the Mediterranean.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plymouth-based Type 23 frigate and crew of 215 left Plymouth last month and will be policing busy shipping lanes in the Gulf crucial to maritime trade in order to disrupt and deter piracy and other illegal activities at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the ship at a high level of readiness takes a lot of training and hard work, so, during the ship’s transit to the region, the crew have been taking part in a wide variety of physical and military exercises to keep themselves ready for operational duties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A period in the eastern Mediterranean allowed the weapon engineering department to take advantage of a NATO training exercise in Crete and prove the accuracy of all sensors and weapon systems on board. This also allowed the ship’s Royal Navy and Royal Marines boarding teams to participate in multiple boarding exercises with Greek forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dramatic element of the training was ‘fast roping’ down to the ship from a Lynx helicopter operated and maintained by members of the ship’s flight from 815 Naval Air Squadron, who are embarked for the deployment. The warfare department also provided gun shoots and small-arms firings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marine White takes part in a continuation shoot on board HMS Monmouth whilst transiting the Mediterranean en route to the Gulf " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1587/HMS_Monmouth_sharpens_skills_for_the_Gulf2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Marine White takes part in a continuation shoot on board HMS Monmouth whilst transiting the Mediterranean en route to the Gulf [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Ben Shread, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While shooting, fast roping and simulated boarding of small boats took place above deck, the chefs were busy cooking meals for the ship’s company but still found the time to make a replica chocolate version of Nelson’s flagship Victory for the wardroom’s Trafalgar Night dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sailors themselves are also being put through their paces by Leading Physical Trainer Danny Card who has been running boxing circuits and early morning workouts each day to keep them fighting fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Almost 100 per cent of the ship’s company are in date for their standard fitness test and the majority are highly motivated to get fitter during the deployment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high demand for lots of different types of fitness training, with every range of fitness represented taking part in physical exercise on board each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This busy period for the ship’s company supplements the months of operational training they had before leaving the UK - the crew of HMS Monmouth is ready in all respects if called into action in the patrol area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
