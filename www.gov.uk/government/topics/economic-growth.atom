    <title>Revisions to the levels of funding required by goods and public service vehicle licence holders</title>
    <summary>Revised figures announced for holders of goods and public service vehicle licences operating for hire or reward.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport has given notice of revisions to the levels of funding required by holders of goods and public service vehicle operators’ licences operating for hire or reward. This is a requirement of EU Regulation 1071/2009 which affects holders of standard national and standard international licences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Traffic Commissioners retain their discretion to set the financial standing levels for restricted licence holders (not covered by the regulation) and they propose to maintain the current rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised figures are set out below and are based on the euro exchange rate on the first working day in October 2012 – as prescribed by EU Regulation 1071/2009. The new rates will come into force on 1 January 2013 and will remain in place until the 31 December 2013 (previous rates are in brackets). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Minimum financial level requirement&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standard national and standard international licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£7,200 (£7,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£4,000, ( £4,200)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Restricted licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£3,100 ( £3,100)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£1,700 ( £1,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits set by EU Regulation 1071/2009 are 9000 euros for the first vehicle and 5000 euros for each subsequent vehicle. For member states not participating in monetary union, the regulation requires the equivalent in their currencies to be revised every year, using the euro exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the first working day of October in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport for everyone </title>
    <summary>Putting accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker is calling on operators and local authorities to work with government to put accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help them to do this, the Department for Transport has published 2 action plans which set out priorities, as well as highlighting areas where action is in the pipeline or already underway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Transport for everyone’ outlines how operators, local councils and the Department can help to make it easier for people using public transport – particularly those with disabilities - to get to where they need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action plan builds on the success achieved in improving accessibility on public transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. At the heart of the plan is the importance of improving door-to-door journeys rather than addressing issues in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s equality action plan looks at how we can encourage a more inclusive transport network and underlines the importance of ensuring that policy makers at all levels are alive to the particular needs and concerns of different groups in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include affordability issues for young people and pensioners and the ability for all people to travel in safety and free from harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A good transport system allows people to access jobs, opportunities and vital services - it needs to work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise the concerns that specific groups of people have about public transport and so we have pulled together ideas from across the transport sector on how these concerns can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The action plans will help policy makers, as well as transport operators, to tackle problems head on and - more importantly - to level the playing field for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Sayce OBE, Disability Rights UK Chief Executive, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An accessible transport infrastructure is essential for what Disability Rights UK wants to achieve – disabled people playing a full and equal part in society. Over the past 20 years we have come a long way as our practical guide ‘Doing transport differently’ shows but there are still too many attitudinal, communication and physical barriers facing disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Action plan’ is a step change towards making further progress. We welcome the commitment that the Department for Transport will continue to work in partnership with disabled people and our organisations to ensure the most effective steps are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Accessibility action plan’ builds on the transport successes of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and aims to create a long lasting legacy of improved access and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Olympic and Paralympic Games, public transport operators carried thousands of spectators with disabilities and work was done to ensure that the travelling public had easy access to information. One of the aims of the ‘Accessibility action plan’ will be to build on the Games Spectator Journey Planner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new planner would cover a wider geographical area and more types of transport as well as being made accessible to people with visual impairments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other measures outlined in the plan include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering where £100 million of extra funding might be best spent in the long term to improve accessibility of railway stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;possible further amendments to the Blue Badge scheme to tackle abuse and fraud in this area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building on guidance for mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs to encourage training for those using this equipment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Equality action plan’ sets out in one place what the department is doing to ensure people from all parts of society have the option to use public transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points addressed in the plan include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility to public transport for young people, older people and those living in rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety and personal security for women travellers, particularly at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling hate crime and bullying on buses and other public transport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promoting employment of under-represented groups within the transport industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both documents include lists of issues and the actions that have been, or will be, taken to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Release of the accessibility action plan and equality action plan.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today pleased to be publishing the department’s accessibility action plan &lt;a href="/government/publications/accessibility-action-plan"&gt;‘Transport for Everyone: an action plan to improve accessibility for all’&lt;/a&gt;, and, for comment, a draft &lt;a href="/government/publications/equality-action-plan"&gt;equality action plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has already been achieved in making transport more accessible, and the accessibility action plan seeks to address the challenges that remain. In doing so, we also want to draw on the success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games which demonstrated what can be done to provide those using our public transport system with a positive experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility action plan focuses not only on improving physical accessibility, but also on providing better information for the traveller, and on improving attitudes and behaviour, especially towards disabled passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In identifying our priorities in the action plan, we have worked with a large number of representative organisations, individuals, transport operators and local authorities. I am grateful for the support and input that they have provided.  We want transport to be accessible by all and the plan moves us further towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equality action plan presents some of the activities we are undertaking to meet our duties under the equalities legislation, and provides an initial set of priorities for promoting equality and well-being, based on the evidence we have gathered and the engagement we have already had with transport organisations and other interested parties. We are seeking comments on this initial draft and will publish a final version following further engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="latest-data"&gt;Latest data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisional data show that 82.3% of journeys made on Highways Agency managed roads between November 2011 and October 2012 were ‘on time’. This is 0.3 percentage points lower than the previous rolling year, ending in September 2012..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During October 2012, provisional data show that 79.6% of journeys on Highways Agency’s motorway and ‘A’ road network were ‘on time’. This is 3.4 percentage points lower than the equivalent figure for October 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The annual reliability measure consistently increased up to March 2012, but has fallen in the last seven months, and has now dropped below the level observed at the end of 2011. The recent downward trend in reliability reflects the substantial amount of rainfall experienced since spring compared with the same period in 2011. In fact, rainfall in each of the last seven months has been higher in 2012 compared to the same month in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background-information"&gt;Background information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicator monitors the reliability of journeys made on Highways Agency’s motorway and A road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indicator is measured by the percentage of ‘journeys’ on these roads that are ‘on time’. For this measure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a ‘journey’ represents travel between adjacent junctions on the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an ‘on time journey’ is defined as one which is completed within a set reference time, drawn from historic data on that particular section of road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reference journey times are updated for the April data each year - further information on the impact of updating reference times can be found in section 3 of the latest &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/road-congestion-and-reliability-statistics"&gt;statistical release&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, information about the reliability of journeys on individual routes, or between particular junctions on the network, are not sufficiently robust to be presented as official statistics. This is due to the range of different sources used to calculate journey times across the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is working with the Highways Agency to address these issues of comparability. It is likely that any actions to address these issues will also require some historic adjustment to the national series although the trends reported in national reliability to date are unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this programme is complete, the Highways Agency will publish information about journey time reliability at a sub-national level through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk"&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011, 39% of urban trips under 5 miles in England were taken by walking or cycling and 9% were taken by public transport.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proportion of urban trips under 5 miles taken by (i) walking or cycling; (ii) public transport: England, 2010 and 2011 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;39% were taken by walking or cycling in 2011 compared with 37% in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;9% were taken by public transport in 2011, compared with 10% in 2010. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London was the region with the highest proportion of walking or cycling and public transport trips, 43% and 22% respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The region with the lowest proportion of walking or cycling trips was the West Midlands (32%). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The South West had the lowest proportion of public transport trips (4%).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boosting private sector employment in England</title>
    <summary>Supporting private sector projects and partnerships that have the potential for long-term economic growth in the UK</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-issue"&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain parts of the country have been dependent on the public sector for employment. To help these areas grow their private sectors - and create more jobs - the government has established a regional growth fund (RGF) of £2.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have up to £1 billion of funding to allocate under the RGF to stimulate economic growth and encourage private sector investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/regional-growth-fund/how-to-apply" title="apply for funding"&gt;apply for funding&lt;/a&gt; from now until 13 June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund will support private sector projects and public/private partnerships that have the potential for long-term economic growth and the creation of sustainable jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="who-can-apply-for-funding"&gt;Who can apply for funding?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private or public-private organisations in England can apply for funding. It can be used for capital investment, research and development or training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations must apply for a minimum of £1 million funding. Funding can be a grant, loan or loan guarantee. We will assess projects on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;location  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value for money for taxpayers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ability to create jobs in the private sector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;project management expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects must fit the European Union’s rules on state aid - we need to ensure any funding does not give a company unfair competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, we allocated £1.4 billion of the RGF in 2 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round 1, April 2011: £450 million was allocated to 50 bids, attracting £2.5 billion in private sector investment. The projects will create or safeguard over 27,000 direct jobs, with around 100,000 more in companies that are suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Round 2, October 2011: £950 million was invested in 126 bids, attracting nearly £6 billion of private investment. Around 200,000 jobs will be created or protected: around 37,000 direct jobs, with more than 164,000 in companies that are suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Increasing the UK’s exports and attracting inward investment</title>
    <summary>Helping businesses increase their exports and making the UK more competitive.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inward investment into the UK economy created or secured more than &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/aboutukti/item/344820.html"&gt;112,000 jobs in 2011 to 12&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to help double the UK’s exports to £1 trillion by 2020 and attract more inward investment in UK infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are determined to remain one of the top countries for ease of doing business, by providing more support for British businesses to export their goods and services, and reducing corporation tax to competitive levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment’s (&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/301280.html"&gt;Passport to Export&lt;/a&gt; is an assessment and skills-based programme that gives new and inexperienced exporters the training, planning and ongoing support needed to succeed overseas. Passport to Export also helps companies to research, visit and select markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British businesses can carry out export marketing research on all the major aspects of any export venture using &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/howwehelp/exportmarketingresearchscheme.html"&gt;Export Marketing Research Scheme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/109254.html"&gt;Export Communications Review&lt;/a&gt; gives companies impartial advice on language and cultural issues to improve their competitiveness in export markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/corporate_tax_reform_part1a_roadmap.pdf"&gt;simplifying and reducing corporation tax&lt;/a&gt; to encourage inward investment. The reduction to the rate of 24% means that the UK now has the lowest main rate in the G7 and the fifth lowest in the G20. We plan to reduce the rate to 21% from April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt; established the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/ukadvisorynetwork.html"&gt;UK Advisory Network&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 to provide high-quality and trusted support to investors setting up in the UK and UK companies doing business overseas through closer working between the government and the private sector. The network makes access to private sector expertise easier and more effective and allows those experts to share knowledge and market information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;FCO’s Business Charter&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2011, shows how FCO resources can meet the needs of British business. It is part of the FCO’s work to create lasting prosperity for the UK, explaining the specific contribution that the FCO makes to support business across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="www.ukti.gov.uk"&gt;&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has an ongoing programme of research that looks into the effect of exporting on UK companies across the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/download/160040/4/68420_EET_Acc_Access.pdf.html"&gt;Bringing home the benefits: how to grow through exporting&lt;/a&gt; found that for many UK companies the decision to grow through exporting has been profitable. Those companies who venture into new export markets tend to be rewarded both directly through boosted turnover, and indirectly through improved levels of efficiency, innovation and credibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/download/160040_117340/New%20markets,%20new%20ideas.pdf.html"&gt;New markets, new ideas: How exporting fosters innovation and growth&lt;/a&gt; suggests that many British companies are embracing a new era of internationalisation. This can be seen in both an increasing number of companies doing business overseas and the rising number of firms that export from an early stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also investigates the benefits business experience as a result of exporting including increased levels of growth, productivity and innovation. More young companies are grabbing international opportunities from an early stage; almost one in five (17%) new companies currently active abroad are classified as ‘Born Global’ - so have been doing business overseas since the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many internationalised firms experience a ‘virtuous circle’ where exporting led to innovation, and where those innovations then led to further exporting. Over half of all firms (53%) said that a new product or service evolved because of their business overseas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strengthening UK relationships in Asia, Latin America and Africa to support UK prosperity and security</title>
    <summary>Opening up new markets for secure trade and investment with British businesses.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic and political weight is shifting east and south. This means that fast-growing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa are essential to our interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to increase Britain’s prosperity and security by improving links with the economic and political powers of tomorrow. We are helping these markets grow so UK business can enjoy the mutual benefits of trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has already reallocated resources to boost the UK’s presence in the fastest-growing parts of the world. Ministers across government are planning their overseas travel strategically to meet influential politicians, business and community leaders in the fastest-growing parts of the world, and host them when they visit the UK. These meetings concentrate on building links, including trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emerging Powers Fund launched in autumn 2012, supporting projects to the value of £1.8 million over 3 years to build links with the fastest-growing parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prosperity Fund was launched in April 2011 so that the UK can create the conditions for sustainable global growth and development. In its first year the fund gave £19.4 million to 248 projects in 14 countries and regions to build links with the fastest-growing parts of the world. In 2012-2013, the fund is allocating £19 million in 15 countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment’s (&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;) new strategy, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/148300.html"&gt;Britain open for business&lt;/a&gt;, launched in May 2011, explains our plans to provide practical support to exporters and inward investors over 5 years, including winning high-value overseas opportunities for UK businesses. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;Business Charter&lt;/a&gt; launched alongside the &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s strategy, shows how the government supports UK business abroad, including in the fastest-growing parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every overseas post, Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (&lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;) staff undertake press and communications work, which includes building relations with local media, and communicating the advantages of investing in and trading with the UK. A small London-based team works with the 1,700 London-based international media to ensure they understand the UK’s economic strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; operates websites in 53 local languages around the world, which attract 10 million visitors every year. These platforms are used to champion the UK’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since publishing the white paper on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/international-trade-investment-and-development/docs/t/11-717-trade-investment-for-growth.pdf"&gt;Trade and investment for growth&lt;/a&gt;  in February 2011, the government has: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supported businesses to secure more than £800 million of high-value opportunities overseas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helped more than 20,000 small and medium-sized enterprises to export and break into new high-growth markets like India, China, Brazil and Turkey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched new export finance products to support smaller businesses to sell their products abroad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced Strategic Relationship Management for large UK exporting firms and important inward investors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked with the World Trade Organisation to agree Russia’s accession, after 18 years of negotiations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade and investment for growth white paper: &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade-white-paper-progress-and-achievements-in-year-1"&gt;Progress and achievements in year one&lt;/a&gt; explains the progress made against the commitments in that white paper as part of the government’s effort to rebalance the UK economy through trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Business Charter&lt;/a&gt;, launched in May 2011, describes the support the &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; provides to British businesses, helping them to identify and pursue new opportunities overseas, manage risks and build relationships abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charter was launched alongside the &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s 5-year strategy, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/148300.html"&gt;Britain open for business&lt;/a&gt;, which explains how the government is generating growth through trade and supporting exporters and inward investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
