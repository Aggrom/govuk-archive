    <title>Reducing the impact of regulation on business</title>
    <summary>Cutting red tape, improving existing regulations and avoiding unnecessary new regulations.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some regulations are ineffective and unnecessary. Complying with them costs businesses time and money, and can restrict growth. Red tape can also make running charities and community groups more difficult than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to ensure all regulations are fair and effective. We want to strike the right balance between protecting people’s rights, health and safety and freeing them from unnecessary bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure regulations in the UK are fair and effective, we are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;controlling the number of new regulations by &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-impact-of-regulation-on-business/supporting-pages/operating-a-one-in-two-out-rule-for-business-regulation"&gt;operating a ‘one in, two out’ rule for business regulation&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We publish &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;keywords=&amp;amp;publication_filter_option=guidance&amp;amp;topics%5B%5D=all&amp;amp;departments%5B%5D=department-for-business-innovation-skills"&gt;guidance for all government policymakers&lt;/a&gt; to help design better regulations or find other options instead of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, regulations - and the inspections and bureaucracy that go with them - have piled up. Businesses say the amount of new regulation is one of their biggest problems, preventing them from growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf"&gt;coalition agreement&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2010, we said that we would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cut red tape for businesses and individuals &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not rely on rules and regulations by themselves to get things done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-were-consulting-with"&gt;Who we’re consulting with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re running a series of reviews called ‘Focus on enforcement’ to get businesses’ views on how we could improve the way we enforce regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/"&gt;Have your say on how we enforce regulations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also running the Red Tape Challenge, asking businesses and the public which regulations they think could be removed or improved. See what businesses are saying: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Tell us which regulations you think should be removed or improved.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Government support for small to medium sized businesses and start-ups - from finance to help and advice</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people feel that starting a business is not for them, either because they’re worried about finding funding and making money or because they don’t think they have the skills or experience needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, research shows that existing small and medium enterprises (&lt;abbr title="small to medium enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;) can be put off growing their business because of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of access to finance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not being able to recruit people and lacking the right skills in new and existing staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;day-to-day cash flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a scheme with the Bank of England to enable banks and building societies to borrow from them at cheaper rates so that they can then lend to small to medium businesses (&lt;abbr title="small to medium enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;) at lower interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new business bank that will provide more funding to &lt;abbr title="small to medium enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-it-easier-to-set-up-and-grow-a-business--6/supporting-pages/helping-businesses-and-start-ups-get-advice-and-support"&gt;providing funding and programmes to encourage private sector investment in small businesses&lt;/a&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve launched websites that provide information to &lt;abbr title="small to medium enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; on how to run and grow their business – Business in You, GrowthAccelerator, Mentorsme and Manufacturing Advisory Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of private sector businesses in the UK increased to 4.8 million at the start of 2012 – a record high. Barclays estimate there were just under 500,000 business start-ups in England and Wales in 2011; also a record number and 12,700 (2.6%) more than in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same period about 500,000 businesses closed. Businesses have told us that they need access to finance and less red tape in order to keep running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve developed our policies to support start-ups and &lt;abbr title="small to medium enterprises"&gt;SMEs&lt;/abbr&gt; so that they can continue to grow and make a contribution to the economy and so that they get access to finance and support that hasn’t been previously available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work closely with businesses, financial institutions and other government departments to help make sure the environment is right for UK businesses to start up, grow and succeed. Our work covers:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ensuring the future of the universal postal service and Post Office network services</title>
    <summary>How the government is making sure there will always be a universal postal service.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universal postal service - the six-day-a-week, one-price-goes-anywhere service to every address in the UK - is important for communities and the economy. The government needs to make sure the future of the service is secure and that everyone continues to have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Post Office network is a unique national asset that provides convenient access to vital social and economic services to local communities across the UK. It needs to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wholly owns both Royal Mail Group Ltd (which provides the universal postal service in the UK) and Post Office Ltd (which runs the network of post offices). This shareholding is managed by the Shareholder Executive in the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="attracting-private-capital-into-royal-mail"&gt;Attracting private capital into Royal Mail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help protect the future of the universal postal service, we aim to end Royal Mail’s dependence on unpredictable funding from the taxpayer by attracting private capital into the company.  We intend to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/ensuring-the-future-of-the-universal-postal-service-and-post-office-network-services/supporting-pages/attracting-private-capital-into-royal-mail"&gt;sell shares in Royal Mail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="funding-and-modernising-the-post-office-network"&gt;Funding and modernising the Post Office network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have committed £1.34 billion of funding for the network from financial year 2011 to 2012 to financial year 2014 to 2015. This will enable the Post Office to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/ensuring-the-future-of-the-universal-postal-service-and-post-office-network-services/supporting-pages/funding-and-modernising-the-post-office-network"&gt;maintain and modernise its network&lt;/a&gt; to help safeguard its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="separating-the-post-office-and-royal-mail"&gt;Separating the Post Office and Royal Mail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Mail and the Post Office are different businesses, facing different challenges. In order to maintain the Post Office in public ownership and enable private sector investment in the Royal Mail letters and parcels business, we separated Post Office Ltd from Royal Mail Group Ltd in April 2012 to become a sister company of Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that the two companies will no longer work together. The Chief Executive of Royal Mail has called it “unthinkable” that there would not always be a strong relationship between Royal Mail and the Post Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the continuation of their existing business relationship, at the time of separation, the management of Royal Mail and the Post Office put in place a commercial contract between the two parties (with the longest possible contract length permitted by law).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="funding-royal-mail-pensions"&gt;Funding Royal Mail pensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 1 April 2012 we transferred Royal Mail’s historic liabilities of around £40 billion from Royal Mail’s pension scheme to a new public sector scheme (the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme, RMSPS) to be administered by the government.  At the same time around £28 billion of Royal Mail’s pension assets were transferred to government. The pension scheme left with Royal Mail was left with matching assets and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="changing-the-regulator"&gt;Changing the regulator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From October 2011 we transferred regulatory responsibility for the postal market from Postcomm to Ofcom, the regulator responsible for the wider communications sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2012 Ofcom put in place new regulations for postal services for the next 7 years. Ofcom’s primary duty is to make sure there continues to be a universal postal service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/coalition-documents"&gt;Coalition Agreement&lt;/a&gt; we said we would aim to inject private capital into Royal Mail, and explore opportunities for employee ownership. We also pledged to retain Post Office Ltd in public ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the request of the Business Secretary Vince Cable, Richard Hooper CBE, the former deputy chairman of Ofcom, updated his December 2008 report, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file49389.pdf"&gt;Modernise or decline&lt;/a&gt; on the maintenance of the universal postal service in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Hooper made three main recommendations in his September 2010 report, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/saving-the-royal-mails-universal-postal-service-in-the-digital-age-an-update-of-the-2008-independent-review"&gt;Saving the Royal Mail’s universal postal service in the digital age&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Mail should have access to private sector capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;its historic pension deficit should be resolved; its deficit of £8 billion sapped cash from the business, making it difficult to compete with other operators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the way postal services are regulated needed to be better balanced so as to allow competition whilst ensuring the universal service remains available  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We agreed and introduced the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/5/contents"&gt;Postal Services Act 2011&lt;/a&gt; to implement the recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011 we &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/post-office-mutualisation"&gt;consulted on the move towards an agreed model for a mutual Post Office&lt;/a&gt;. Our response to the consultation was published in July 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Acts specifically cover postal services in the UK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/5/contents"&gt;Postal Services Act 2011&lt;/a&gt;, which lifted restrictions on the ownership of Royal Mail, allowed for a future mutual ownership model for Post Office Limited (ie ownership across a mix of invested stakeholders, such as employees, subpostmasters and consumers, with no one party having an overall majority), enabled the transfer of the Royal Mail’s historic pension liabilities to government and put the framework in place to deliver a new regulatory regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/26/contents"&gt;Postal Services Act 2000&lt;/a&gt; - some of which was replaced or amended by the 2011 Act - has a number of important provisions still in force. These include provisions relating to offences in relation to the mail, the schemes (ie setting out details of services’ terms and conditions) of universal service providers, application of customs and excise legislation to postal packets, and financing and restructuring of the Royal Mail group of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Postal Services Directives require member states to ensure the provision of a universal postal service.  The requirements of the directives are implemented in UK law by the above Postal Services Acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt; - the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK’s communications industries, and its responsibilities now include the postal sector.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/"&gt;Consumer Focus&lt;/a&gt; - champions the needs of consumers, across markets, including the postal services sector, with a particular regard to the vulnerable, including those who have been or are about to be disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Business regulations are necessary to protect the public and workers from safety risks and prevent pollution and environmental damage, but they can also stop businesses from reaching their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to reduce the number of unnecessary regulations that hold back businesses while ensuring that both workers and the public are protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of Companies Act 2006 was completed in October 2009 and made many changes to simplify and improve company law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a full consultation on reforming the UK system for registering company charges government has developed &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-law/docs/c/12-1025-companies-act-amendment-part-25-regulations-draft.pdf"&gt;draft regulations with a view to amending Part 25 of the Companies Act 2006&lt;/a&gt;.  These regulations are due to be laid before Parliament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shareholders and the public have lost confidence in the way companies are run and they believe that companies should be rewarded for success not failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making companies more accountable in how they work - and showing that they are improving - will increase investor and public confidence, making them more attractive to investors and giving the public more trust in their products and services.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make companies more accountable to their shareholders and the public, the government is:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Controlling defence, security and dual-use strategic exports</title>
    <summary>Regulating exports of military and dual-use equipment and technology to help ensure global security</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wide range of items including goods designed for a military purpose and some commercial goods are controlled under export licence legislation administered by the Export Control Organisation (ECO), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). ECO also regulates the export of certain dual-use goods - commercial items that have the potential to be used for military purposes or terrorism. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;components from the aviation or telecommunications industries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;certain chemicals &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;information security products like encryption software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;radioactive materials &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECO also regulates the export of goods that could be used for capital punishment, torture, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as well as other goods suject to sanction or embargo such as imports or Iranian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are exporting or trading in controlled items you will require a licence issued by the ECO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a licence is required depends on various factors such as whether the items are listed on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items"&gt;UK Strategic Export Control Lists&lt;/a&gt;, subject to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weapons-of-mass-destruction-wmd-end-use-control"&gt;End-Use Controls&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions"&gt;arms embargoes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk"&gt;apply for a licence using SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="goods-passing-through-the-uk"&gt;Goods passing through the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECO applies the same rules to goods passing through UK ports or airports (transit and trans-shipments) as to exports from the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="trade-outside-the-uk"&gt;Trade outside the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECO also controls the trade in certain &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-controls-on-controlled-military-goods"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/brokering-trade-of-dual-use-items"&gt;dual-use&lt;/a&gt; items outside the UK, if a UK citizen or UK company is involved. This regulation is known as ‘trade controls’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="end-use-control"&gt;End-use control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ECO suspects any commercial goods (even if not listed on the Control Lists) will be used for the production of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or for other military purposes, it can make them licensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="taking-decisions-on-export-licence-applications"&gt;Taking decisions on export licence applications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Export Control Organisation (ECO) assesses export licence applications for controlled strategic exports. We assess each application against the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/assessment-of-export-licence-applications-criteria-and-policy"&gt;Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria&lt;/a&gt;. The government updates the law on export and trade controls regularly to reflect changes in the Government’s foreign and security policy and international development goals. For information about these changes subscribe to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol"&gt;Notices to Exporters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECO is part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). ECO works with other government departments as part of the licence decision making process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These departments include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) – on human rights issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ministry of Defence (MOD) – on military capability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Department for International Development (DFID) - on development issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) – on energy, nuclear and chemicals issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also work with industry trade associations like the Export Group for Aerospace and Defence (EGAD) and JETSECC, a policy forum on legislation with particular emphasis on dual-use exports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enforcing-our-decisions"&gt;Enforcing our decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Border Force (BF) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) work together to enforce the UK’s strategic export and trade controls and sanctions and embargoes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMRC has a policy unit which develops and manages enforcement policy. Staff at HMRC’s National Clearance Hub undertake checks on customs export and import declarations and supporting documentation – including checking BIS export licences – to ensure appropriate risk assessment is undertaken.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Border Force officers carry out physical examinations of cargo at ports and airports to detain, disrupt and seize unlicensed or sanctions-breaching goods.  These seizures can result in criminal investigations by HMRC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If exports of military or dual use goods are detected without an export licence, this may result in a prosecution being brought through the Central Fraud Group within the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strengthening UK relationships in Asia, Latin America and Africa to support UK prosperity and security</title>
    <summary>Opening up new markets for secure trade and investment with British businesses.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic and political weight is shifting east and south. This means that fast-growing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa are essential to our interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to increase Britain’s prosperity and security by improving links with the economic and political powers of tomorrow. We are helping these markets grow so UK business can enjoy the mutual benefits of trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has already reallocated resources to boost the UK’s presence in the fastest-growing parts of the world. Ministers across government are planning their overseas travel strategically to meet influential politicians, business and community leaders in the fastest-growing parts of the world, and host them when they visit the UK. These meetings concentrate on building links, including trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emerging Powers Fund launched in autumn 2012, supporting projects to the value of £1.8 million over 3 years to build links with the fastest-growing parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prosperity Fund was launched in April 2011 so that the UK can create the conditions for sustainable global growth and development. In its first year the fund gave £19.4 million to 248 projects in 14 countries and regions to build links with the fastest-growing parts of the world. In 2012-2013, the fund is allocating £19 million in 15 countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment’s (&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;) new strategy, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/148300.html"&gt;Britain open for business&lt;/a&gt;, launched in May 2011, explains our plans to provide practical support to exporters and inward investors over 5 years, including winning high-value overseas opportunities for UK businesses. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;Business Charter&lt;/a&gt; launched alongside the &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s strategy, shows how the government supports UK business abroad, including in the fastest-growing parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every overseas post, Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (&lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;) staff undertake press and communications work, which includes building relations with local media, and communicating the advantages of investing in and trading with the UK. A small London-based team works with the 1,700 London-based international media to ensure they understand the UK’s economic strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; operates websites in 53 local languages around the world, which attract 10 million visitors every year. These platforms are used to champion the UK’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since publishing the white paper on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/international-trade-investment-and-development/docs/t/11-717-trade-investment-for-growth.pdf"&gt;Trade and investment for growth&lt;/a&gt;  in February 2011, the government has: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supported businesses to secure more than £800 million of high-value opportunities overseas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helped more than 20,000 small and medium-sized enterprises to export and break into new high-growth markets like India, China, Brazil and Turkey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched new export finance products to support smaller businesses to sell their products abroad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced Strategic Relationship Management for large UK exporting firms and important inward investors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;worked with the World Trade Organisation to agree Russia’s accession, after 18 years of negotiations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade and investment for growth white paper: &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trade-white-paper-progress-and-achievements-in-year-1"&gt;Progress and achievements in year one&lt;/a&gt; explains the progress made against the commitments in that white paper as part of the government’s effort to rebalance the UK economy through trade and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Business Charter&lt;/a&gt;, launched in May 2011, describes the support the &lt;abbr title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; provides to British businesses, helping them to identify and pursue new opportunities overseas, manage risks and build relationships abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charter was launched alongside the &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s 5-year strategy, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/148300.html"&gt;Britain open for business&lt;/a&gt;, which explains how the government is generating growth through trade and supporting exporters and inward investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Increasing the UK’s exports and attracting inward investment</title>
    <summary>Helping businesses increase their exports and making the UK more competitive.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inward investment into the UK economy created or secured more than &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/aboutukti/item/344820.html"&gt;112,000 jobs in 2011 to 12&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to help double the UK’s exports to £1 trillion by 2020 and attract more inward investment in UK infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are determined to remain one of the top countries for ease of doing business, by providing more support for British businesses to export their goods and services, and reducing corporation tax to competitive levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment’s (&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/301280.html"&gt;Passport to Export&lt;/a&gt; is an assessment and skills-based programme that gives new and inexperienced exporters the training, planning and ongoing support needed to succeed overseas. Passport to Export also helps companies to research, visit and select markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British businesses can carry out export marketing research on all the major aspects of any export venture using &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/howwehelp/exportmarketingresearchscheme.html"&gt;Export Marketing Research Scheme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/uktihome/item/109254.html"&gt;Export Communications Review&lt;/a&gt; gives companies impartial advice on language and cultural issues to improve their competitiveness in export markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/corporate_tax_reform_part1a_roadmap.pdf"&gt;simplifying and reducing corporation tax&lt;/a&gt; to encourage inward investment. The reduction to the rate of 24% means that the UK now has the lowest main rate in the G7 and the fifth lowest in the G20. We plan to reduce the rate to 21% from April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt; established the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/ukadvisorynetwork.html"&gt;UK Advisory Network&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 to provide high-quality and trusted support to investors setting up in the UK and UK companies doing business overseas through closer working between the government and the private sector. The network makes access to private sector expertise easier and more effective and allows those experts to share knowledge and market information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-charter-for-business"&gt;FCO’s Business Charter&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2011, shows how FCO resources can meet the needs of British business. It is part of the FCO’s work to create lasting prosperity for the UK, explaining the specific contribution that the FCO makes to support business across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="www.ukti.gov.uk"&gt;&lt;abbr title="UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment"&gt;UKTI&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has an ongoing programme of research that looks into the effect of exporting on UK companies across the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/download/160040/4/68420_EET_Acc_Access.pdf.html"&gt;Bringing home the benefits: how to grow through exporting&lt;/a&gt; found that for many UK companies the decision to grow through exporting has been profitable. Those companies who venture into new export markets tend to be rewarded both directly through boosted turnover, and indirectly through improved levels of efficiency, innovation and credibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/download/160040_117340/New%20markets,%20new%20ideas.pdf.html"&gt;New markets, new ideas: How exporting fosters innovation and growth&lt;/a&gt; suggests that many British companies are embracing a new era of internationalisation. This can be seen in both an increasing number of companies doing business overseas and the rising number of firms that export from an early stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also investigates the benefits business experience as a result of exporting including increased levels of growth, productivity and innovation. More young companies are grabbing international opportunities from an early stage; almost one in five (17%) new companies currently active abroad are classified as ‘Born Global’ - so have been doing business overseas since the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many internationalised firms experience a ‘virtuous circle’ where exporting led to innovation, and where those innovations then led to further exporting. Over half of all firms (53%) said that a new product or service evolved because of their business overseas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
