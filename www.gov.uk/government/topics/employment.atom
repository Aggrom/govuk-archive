    <title>Making the labour market more flexible, efficient and fair</title>
    <summary>How the government is changing employment laws to encourage companies to hire staff while protecting employee rights. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses say current employment laws are difficult to cope with and put them off taking on staff. This slows the growth of businesses and the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simpler, more flexible employment laws will make it easier for companies to hire and manage staff, while protecting basic workers’ rights. This should encourage employers to create new jobs, supporting enterprise and growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the labour market more flexible, efficient and fair the government is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed to review employment law in May 2010 as part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition-agreement-may-2010_0.pdf" title="Coalition Agreement"&gt;Coalition Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Tape Challenge to reduce regulations launched in April 2011 and includes a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/employment-related-law/" title="review of employment law"&gt;review of employment law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extended the time you need to be employed to be able to claim for unfair dismissal from 1 to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enterprise-and-regulatory-reform-bill-policy-paper" title="Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill"&gt;Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill&lt;/a&gt; which will make changes to the employment tribunal system, including ensuring all employment tribunal claims go to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461" title="Acas"&gt;Acas&lt;/a&gt; and introducing a simpler process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;removed the compulsory retirement age, making it easier for older people to carry on working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Regional-Mediation-Pilot-Schemes-up-and-running-67b90.aspx"&gt;pilot scheme&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the use of mediation to resolve disputes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reviewed how employment rights are enforced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-we-are-consulting"&gt;Who we are consulting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve carried out consultations on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/r/11-511-resolving-workplace-disputes-consultation"&gt;resolving workplace disputes&lt;/a&gt; more quickly without having to go to an employment tribunal &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/publications/6529"&gt;changing the rules on large-scale redundancies&lt;/a&gt;  so that employers can restructure more effectively while also carrying out good quality consultations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/e/12-1037-ending-the-employment-relationship-consultation.pdf" title="changing the rules on ending the employment relationship"&gt;changing the rules on ending the employment relationship&lt;/a&gt;, the use of settlement agreements and changes to the compensation limit in unfair dismissal cases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/employment-tribunal-rules-review-by-mr-justice-underhill"&gt;changing employment tribunal rules&lt;/a&gt; to make them more flexible and effective and to get better value for the taxpayer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve carried out an impact assessment on the benefits of &lt;a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/publications/5450" title="resolving workplace disputes"&gt;resolving workplace disputes&lt;/a&gt;. We estimate these changes will save businesses £40 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
