    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <summary>This toolkit can be used to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (LCEB).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Business rates</title>
    <summary>Written Ministerial Statement by Brandon Lewis on business rates.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 18 October, the government announced our intention to postpone the next business rates revaluation in England from 2015 to 2017. Clause 22 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/growthandinfrastructure.html"&gt;Growth and Infrastructure Bill&lt;/a&gt; currently before the House of Commons will deliver upon this commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the recent Westminster Hall debate on business rates and during the second reading debate on the Bill, ministers committed to provide more information on the analysis which has informed the government’s position to assist parliamentary scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full assessment would require a revaluation, which in itself would cost £43 million and take a significant amount of time. However, the Valuation Office Agency have today published their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/News/2012/newsRelease_November_2012.html"&gt;high level estimates of non-domestic rental and rating assessment movements for England&lt;/a&gt; as at January 2012; it provides an illustration of the potential impact those rateable values would have had on business rate bills. The Agency’s analysis is based on professional judgements informed by limited rental market evidence up to January 2012. The analysis has been prepared independently of ministers and published in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last revaluation was based on April 2008 valuations and rents set at the height of an unsustainable property boom. Since then, the economy and property market have faced exceptional changes. Rents have fallen since that property boom. Some groups have assumed that falling business rents would entail falling business rates. However, this is not the case. While aggregate rateable values have fallen, this would automatically be offset at the revaluation by a higher rating multiplier. Firms would just be required to pay a higher proportion of their rateable value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Agency’s estimates are based on an increase in the multiplier of 16%. My department has actually forecast an increase of 20%, as a consequence of inflation and the adjustment required to the multiplier for appeals; in this context, in practice, the losers would be likely to be even greater than those presented in the Agency’s paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Agency’s analysis suggests that 800,000 premises would have seen a real term increase in their rates at a 2015 revaluation. This compares to 300,000 seeing reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sectors would have faced big hikes including petrol stations (+28% tax paid), the self-catering industry such as caravan parks (+29% paid), hotels (+6% tax paid), theatres (+25% tax paid), and pubs (+11% tax paid). The retail sector overall would have seen a tax rise of 1% above inflation, and food retail and convenience stores in particular would have faced significant tax increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given business rates are the third biggest outgoing for local firms after staff and rent, such changes would invariably feed through to more expensive prices for family’s weekly shop, more expensive pints in pubs and a significant hit on Britain’s tourism trade. Indeed, as Community Pubs Minister, I am very aware of the concern expressed by honourable members on the pressures being faced by local pubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revaluations should be revenue-neutral, and equally, postponing the revaluation will be revenue-neutral. Overall the revaluation would not change the total business rates paid in England, so some sectors and locations would have seen reductions at 2015. During recent parliamentary exchanges, it was unfairly suggested that that this change was being done to assist southern parts of England at the expense of other parts of the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, our analysis shows that offices in central London would have seen by far the greatest reductions in tax paid if the 2015 revaluation had gone ahead (a fall in aggregate rateable value that is one of the reasons why the multiplier has to be increased by so much to make up for the lost revenue). There are complex variations by both locality and by sector in different parts of the country, but what is clear is that there would be far more losers than winners across the country as a whole. In making this decision, ministers are seeking to support the national interest and the economy as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that as a very direct form of taxation, business rates are not popular. Local government finance is too often opaque and confusing. However, we are acting in an open and transparent manner. This independent evidence shows that by postponing the 2015 revaluation, we will protect local firms and local shops from sharp changes in business rates bills at a time when we want to ensure the economy is growing. It will provide business with a stable economic environment in which to invest and support jobs for the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of the document will be placed in the Library together with a copy of the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growth-and-infrastructure-bill-impact-assessment"&gt;Impact Assessment for the Growth and Infrastructure Bill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Eric Pickles acts to limit town hall chiefs' golden goodbyes</title>
    <summary>The legal minefield that can pressure councils into giving large pay offs to chief executives they want to dismiss is to be ended.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow and costly bureaucracy that requires councils to appoint an independent person, usually a Queen’s Counsel, to review dismissal and disciplinary cases for chief executives is to be changed. The Isles of Scilly Council has recently suspended its chief executive pending one of these investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils seeking to dismiss a chief executive for misconduct or poor performance often pay out inflated lump sums to avoid the cost of taking this bureaucratic route. Eric Pickles intends to remove this expensive roadblock, which does not exist in other parts of government or the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local government estimates the review process can cost between £100,000 and £250,000 in legal fees not counting independent investigation costs and salary for the suspended officer. One case cost £420,000 and took 16 months to adjudicate. Ministers believe decisions by full council ensure proper democratic accountability, without the need for a centrally dictated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post of chief executive is not set in statute, which means there are no central barriers to removing the role. It only takes a simple democratic decision by the council. Several councils have done this in the past year. The statutory head of paid service role can be done by another senior officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles has also today written to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.local.gov.uk/" title="Local Government Association"&gt;Local Government Association&lt;/a&gt; to urge them to take steps to improve their performance management of senior posts. Better management can make it easier and quicker to tackle performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A town hall chief executive costs a lot of money, but if they are simply not up to the job, councillors must be able to get rid of them quick smart without having to throw away thousands in parachute pay-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is ridiculous that councils feel forced to give bumper pay offs to dismiss inadequate chief executives simply to avoid these unnecessary golden goodbye reviews from expensive lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Scrapping this bizarre bureaucratic ritual will save taxpayers money and put the decision firmly back in democratically elected hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act requires councils to publish their pay policies so that local remuneration arrangements - particularly for chief officers - are out in the open and provide value for money for local taxpayers. The associated guidance states councils should vote on pay deals over £100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles announced he intends to toughen up the guidance before councils publish their pay policies for next year. For example, if smaller councils do not pay staff above £100,000 they should consider setting a lower vote threshold. Ministers will reserve the right to regulate should councils not act on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also states that councils should also publicly justify any big bonuses; above inflation pay rises; hiring staff already in receipt of public sector retirement or severance money; and avoid any perceptions of minimising tax payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a public worried about the cost of living and all parts of the public sector looking to make deficit savings, ministers believe these steps will show taxpayers that value for money is being fully considered for top paid staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Changes to the Audit Commission Board</title>
    <summary>The Department for Communities and Local Government has launched a recruitment process to find 3 new board commissioners. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of appointment for 7 commissioners comes to an end on 31 December 2012. The Secretary of State has taken the decision, with support from the chairman of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Pages/default.aspx" title="Audit Commission"&gt;Audit Commission&lt;/a&gt;, to offer reappointment 4 of the existing board members, and a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://publicappointments.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/" title="Public Appointments website"&gt;recruitment exercise&lt;/a&gt; has commenced to find 3 new members of the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new commissioners will work alongside other board members to achieve an efficient and effective closedown and, in the lead up to closure, oversee the smaller Commission’s remaining duties and the transfer of continuing functions to other bodies. The full programme of reforms to local audit and inspection, and the closure of the Commission, will bring in a more localist approach and are expected to save £650 million in public money over the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Making local councils more transparent and accountable to local people</title>
    <summary>We want local councils to provide more information on how they are spending public money and about the decisions they make.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public should be able to hold local councils to account about the services they provide. To do this, people need information about what decisions local councils are taking, and how local councils are spending public money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If councils publish their data in open formats with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/government-licensing/about-the-ogl.htm" title="The National Archive: open government licences"&gt;open licenses,&lt;/a&gt; people will be able to use and reuse the data for many different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="publishing-council-spending-and-salaries-online"&gt;Publishing council spending and salaries online&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) has asked all local councils and fire and rescue authorities in England to publish spending information over £500 online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve created guides on publishing &lt;a rel="external" href="http://localtransparency.readandcomment.com/" title="Local transparency: guides to publishing data"&gt;local spending data,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel="external" href="http://localsalaries.readandcomment.com/" title="Local transparency: senior salaries"&gt;senior salary information&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://localnewcontracts.readandcomment.com/" title="Local transparency: new contracts &amp;amp; tenders"&gt;new contracts.&lt;/a&gt; The guidance was produced by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.local.gov.uk/" title="Local Government Association"&gt;Local Government Association,&lt;/a&gt; working with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/local-public-data-panel" title="Data.gov.uk: Local Public Data Panel"&gt;Local Public Data Panel.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local councils must now produce &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people/supporting-pages/publishing-details-of-local-council-pay-and-jobs" title="Publishing details of local council pay and jobs"&gt;policy statements about staff pay&lt;/a&gt;, including senior and lower-paid staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="peoples-rights-to-see-council-accounts"&gt;People’s rights to see council accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have 20 days a year to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people/supporting-pages/peoples-rights-to-see-council-accounts" title="People's rights to see council accounts"&gt;inspect town hall accounts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="local-government-transparency-code"&gt;Local government transparency code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve drawn up a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-data-transparency-code" title="Local authority data transparency code"&gt;code of recommended practice for local authorities on data transparency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="local-council-publicity"&gt;Local council publicity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve introduced a new &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-code-of-practice-for-local-authority-publicity" title="Recommended code of practice for local authority publicity"&gt;publicity code for local councils in England&lt;/a&gt;. The code provides guidance on the content, style, distribution and cost of local authority publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="reforming-local-audit"&gt;Reforming local audit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are replacing the Audit Commission with new local arrangements for auditing local councils. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local bodies will be able to appoint their own auditors from an open and competitive market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oversight by the National Audit Office, Financial Reporting Council and professional accountancy bodies will make sure that high standards of auditing continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="local-procurement"&gt;Local procurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re encouraging all councils to make regular use of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder" title="Contracts Finder"&gt;Contracts Finder,&lt;/a&gt; a tool that helps match up providers and bidders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made it easier for small and medium-sized companies to bid for contracts by removing the need for bidders to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire to tender for contracts under £100,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="accountability-system-statement-for-local-government"&gt;Accountability system statement for local government&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; publishes an annual &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accountability-system-statement-for-local-government--2" title="Accountability system statement for local government"&gt;‘Accountability system statement for local government’&lt;/a&gt;. This sets out the funding systems, laws and guidance that apply to local councils and fire and rescue authorities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="demonstrating-the-benefits-of-local-transparency"&gt;Demonstrating the benefits of local transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In partnership with the London Borough of Lambeth, &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; has developed &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lambeth-in-numbers.co.uk/" title="Lambeth in Numbers"&gt;Lambeth in Numbers&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how better access to information can help people to understand and solve problems in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using this demonstration project to stimulate further debate in Lambeth and other local council areas about open data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://openlylocal.com/" title="Openly Local"&gt;Openly Local&lt;/a&gt; project now makes use of the data provided by more than 140 local councils. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing more council information will also put the voluntary sector and small businesses in a stronger position to bid for contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="gathering-better-financial-information-from-local-government-to-help-make-public-services-more-efficient"&gt;Gathering better financial information from local government to help make public services more efficient&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask local authorities in England to report &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people/supporting-pages/quarterly-revenue-outturn" title="Quarterly revenue outturn"&gt;revenue expenditure and forecast outturn&lt;/a&gt; every 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also published the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people/supporting-pages/single-data-list" title="Single data list"&gt;single data list&lt;/a&gt;. This is a list of all the datasets that local government must submit to central government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with HM Treasury requirements, &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; collects returns from English local authorities for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-local-councils-more-transparent-and-accountable-to-local-people/supporting-pages/local-data-for-whole-of-government-accounts" title="Whole of Government Accounts"&gt;Whole of Government Accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir Bob Kerslake, Permanent Secretary of &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;, published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accountability-adapting-to-decentralisation--2" title="Accountability: adapting to decentralisation"&gt;report on the transparency of local public services&lt;/a&gt; in September 2011. The report recommended ways to make sure that local councils are transparent and accountable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this report, all government departments started to publish annual ‘accountability system statements’ about the money they provide to local bodies. These statements demonstrate to Parliament that appropriate checks on spending are still in place following the move to a more local approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/local-authorities-data-transparency-code" title="Local authorities data transparency code consultation"&gt;consulted on the draft local government transparency code&lt;/a&gt; in early 2011. The consultation was published in February 2011 and the responses to the consultation were published in September 2011. In October 2012, we &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/improving-local-government-transparency" title="Improving local government transparency"&gt;consulted on updating the code and making it mandatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on the draft Local Audit Bill in July and August 2012. This Bill will abolish the Audit Commission and put in place new local arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/local-authority-publicity-code" title="Local authority publicity code consultation"&gt;consulted local authorities about our draft revised Publicity Code&lt;/a&gt; in 2010. The Communities and Local Government Select Committee also undertook a short inquiry looking at the draft revised Code. Their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmcomloc/666/666.pdf" title="The Communities and Local Government Select Committee report: proposed code of recommended practice on local authority publicity"&gt;report (PDF 4.2MB)&lt;/a&gt; was published on 27 January 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public accountability of local government is covered in several Acts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted" title="Localism Act 2011"&gt;Localism Act 2011&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Double boost for carbon cutting buses</title>
    <summary>An extra £20 million is being made available for the government’s Green Bus Fund.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extra £20 million is being made available for the government’s Green Bus Fund Transport Minister Norman Baker has announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a second boost for low carbon buses Mr Baker has today launched an easy-to-use toolkit to allow local authorities and bus operators to make informed decisions on investing in carbon cutting buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £20 million funding will be the fourth round of the Green Bus Fund, bringing the total support for this initiative to £95 million since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional funding has been found from an underspend in the Department for Transport’s budget and those wishing to buy green buses will be able to apply for the round four support this financial year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cutting carbon emissions from transport is not a choice, it is a necessity and that is why I am prioritising green buses and giving operators and local authorities an extra £20 million to deliver on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our new toolkit will be indispensible in allowing those considering investment in low carbon buses to see the advantages for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new online low carbon bus calculator will make it easier to quickly work out the savings that can be made over time through cheaper running costs and fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the bidding process and eligibility will be published soon on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new low carbon bus toolkit will help operators and local authorities work out how the finances might stack up, with or without support from the Green Bus Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those wanting to work out how long it will take for a low carbon bus to pay for itself can now go online and use the new calculator which will allow them to quickly work this out using assumptions around capital costs and fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While buses using low carbon technologies tend to be more expensive than conventional buses many are eligible for government support and running costs are usually lower so that, over time, they are actually the more economical choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit launched today will allow councils and operators to see at a glance how quickly they can expect a return on investment in low carbon buses using a variety of carbon saving technologies such as hybrid or electric buses. It also shows operators and local authorities the savings on offer through reduced running costs from low carbon buses compared with running a bus using conventional fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit also allows the user to tailor the calculation of costs to their specific circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/low-carbon-bus-calculator"&gt;toolkit is available&lt;/a&gt; on the department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Round 4 of the Green Bus Fund was launched on the 6 November 2012. Bidding and eligibility guidance for the 4th round will be issued shortly on the Department for Transport website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scotland is holding a separate £3 million competition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The budget for round 4 of the Fund is £20 million with the funding coming from an underspend in the department’s budget.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the fourth round of the government’s grant. Round one was launched in 2009 and paid up to 100 per cent of the difference, with round two paying up to 90 per cent and round three up to 80 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further details on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/background-to-the-green-bus-fund"&gt;fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buses funded through the Green Bus Fund are eligible for the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) Low Carbon Bus incentive of 6p for every kilometre operated in service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous rounds of the Green Bus Fund have part funded diesel hybrid buses, which run on a combination of diesel and a battery, fully electric buses and biomethane-fuelled gas buses. Eligibility for the 4th round will be published shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each year, every low carbon bus in London saves around 26 tonnes of CO2 compared with its diesel equivalent, with buses outside London estimated to save around 22 tonnes.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Town hall pension changes could unlock up to £22 billion for infrastructure</title>
    <summary>Councils could invest as much as as £22 billon more of pension fund investments into infrastructure under new proposals.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councils would be free to pump as much as £22 billon more of pension fund investments into infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is supporting the government’s ambitions to build more homes, roads or high speed railway under proposals announced by local government secretary Eric Pickles today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/local-government-pension-scheme-investment-in-partnerships" title="local government pension scheme: investment in partnerships - consultation"&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; would potentially allow councils to double the amount they can legally invest from their pension funds directly into key infrastructure projects in a new and more efficient way that ensures long-term value for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment in infrastructure is a vital part of the government’s economic growth strategy. Innovative approaches that increase the amount of finance available for projects are needed to back ambitions for the economy and to help manage the inherited deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local government pension scheme for England and Wales is administered by 89 separate local funds that hold combined investment assets worth £150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pension fund rules are there to make sure investment risks are spread across different types of investments to give taxpayers long-term protection. Fund managers are currently limited in the amount they can invest via partnership arrangements, which includes many types of infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals published for consultation today include an option to increase the current limit of 15% to 30%. This would clear the barriers standing in the way of better council investment giving them the scope to inject up to £45 billion in such arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Unlocking town hall pension pots so they can be used to invest in vital infrastructure projects is a common sense decision that will help this country complete on a global scale and get Britain building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By lifting the restrictions controlling local pension investments councils could pump a further £22 billion directly into job-creating infrastructure projects that will boost our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is potentially a huge development and investment opportunity we simply cannot afford to ignore that also allows us to maintain long-term value for money for the taxpayer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report by the Future Homes Commission said council pension funds could be used to build key infrastructure projects like new homes in the UK without increasing the government deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment decisions remain for individual local pension funds, which have a duty to protect the local council taxpayers, and local services and to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Investment in green buses</title>
    <summary>Written statement by Norman Baker MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce today that the department is making a further £20 million available to help bus operators and local authorities in England buy low carbon emission buses through a fourth round of the Green Bus Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operators and authorities will be able to bid for a share of this funding to meet the additional up-front cost of purchasing these buses, and we calculate that this will allow for around 300 new low carbon buses to be bought. This investment will aid the department’s overarching objectives of helping to create growth and cut carbon, as well as help to support UK manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guidance document will be published later this month giving more details of how bus operators and local authorities can bid for a share of this fund. Copies of this will be placed at the same time in the libraries of the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/low-carbon-bus-calculator"&gt;toolkit has also been published today&lt;/a&gt; advising bus operators and local authorities on how quickly they can expect a return from investing in low carbon emission buses.&lt;/p&gt;
