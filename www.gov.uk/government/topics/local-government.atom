    <title>Improving local government transparency</title>
    <summary>Consultation about making the 'Code of recommended practice for local authorities on data transparency' a legal requirement.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of the ‘Code of recommended practice for local authorities on Data Transparency’ in September 2011, ministers would now like to make the code a legal requirement via regulations, subject to consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to enforce the code through regulations via the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/65/contents" title="Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980"&gt;Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980&lt;/a&gt;, Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers wish to hear from all those local authorities listed in paragraph 4 of the code. They would also like to hear from relevant bodies, open data experts, developers, citizen activists and other interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Technical reforms to Council Tax: when dwellings should not be liable to the empty homes premium</title>
    <summary>Consultation about the government's proposals on homes that should not be charged the empty homes premium.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Finance Bill includes provisions that will allow a billing authority to charge an empty homes premium to provide a stronger incentive to get homes back into productive use and remove the blight of such properties on local neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium was subject to a consultation, ‘Technical Reforms to Council Tax’, which ended on 29 December 2011. The government published its response on 28 May 2012, which confirmed its intention to proceed with the premium and stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will not be payable until a dwelling has been empty and unfurnished for 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the maximum premium that an authority will be able to charge will be 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on the government’s proposals on exceptions to the premium: dwellings which may otherwise be liable for the premium, but which are subject to circumstances that mean that it would not be appropriate for it to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

The proposed new code will be underpinned by 7 guiding principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give effect to the government’s commitment to stop unfair competition by local authority newspapers, the proposed new Code now contains specific guidance on the frequency, content and appearance of local authority newspapers or magazines. It also proposes to prohibit the use of lobbyists where the expenditure is intended to influence local people on political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003</title>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation invites views on the draft consolidation of the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003 and 4 amending instruments, and incorporation of a series of technical amendments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an increase in the threshold below which a body is classed as a smaller body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a revised procedure for the approval and publication of statements of accounts and other accounting statements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;new provision for the accounts of Passenger Transport Executives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the removal of criminal penalties for non-compliance with the regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft also restructures the regulations with the aim of making them easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation is part of a regular series of updates to the Accounts and Audit Regulations designed to keep them in line with developments in financial governance, accounting and audit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous updates were made most recently in 2003, 2006, and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Future of local public audit</title>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 13 August 2010 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced plans to disband the Audit Commission, and refocus audit of local public bodies on helping local people hold those bodies to account for local spending decisions, the very essence of localism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to replace the current, centralised audit systems managed by the Audit Commission, with a new decentralised regime, which will support local democratic accountability, and one that will also cut bureaucracy and costs, while ensuring that there continues to be robust local public audit. This consultation sets out proposals on the new audit framework where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audit quality is regulated within a statutory framework, overseen by the National Audit Office and the accountancy profession&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;local public bodies will be free to appoint their own external auditors with stringent safeguards for independence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
