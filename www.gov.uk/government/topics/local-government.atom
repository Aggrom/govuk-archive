    <title>Giving local authorities more control over how they spend public money in their area</title>
    <summary>We're handing back control to councils, and letting them share in the financial benefits of generating growth in their areas.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;England’s local government finance system is one of the most centralised in the world. This means that local authorities don’t have the autonomy and flexibility they need to make sure public money is spent on the things that matter in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government believes that local authorities are better placed to make decisions about the needs of their local communities than central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="local-services-support-grant"&gt;Local Services Support Grant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2013, local councils will be able to decide how most of their grants from central government should be spent in their area. The only exceptions are schools funding and the new public health grant. The new
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/local-services-support-grant" title="Local Services Support Grant"&gt;Local Services Support Grant&lt;/a&gt; is a single grant paid by central government to individual councils to help support and protect local services. Councils can decide themselves how they wish to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="protecting-funding-in-areas-that-are-most-reliant-on-central-government-funding"&gt;Protecting funding in areas that are most reliant on central government funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some areas are more dependent than others on central government funding, because they have a higher proportion of people who pay lower levels of Council Tax. The 2012 to 2013 local government finance settlement includes measures to protect those councils most reliant on central government funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="business-rates-retention"&gt;Business rates retention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re introducing a new &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/business-rates-retention" title="business rates retention scheme"&gt;business rates retention scheme&lt;/a&gt; from 2013 to 2014. This will allow councils to keep a share of growth in business rates in their area and reduce their dependency on central government grant funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-budgets"&gt;Community Budgets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/community-budgets" title="Community Budgets"&gt;Community Budgets&lt;/a&gt; are a new way for local public service providers to work more effectively together. Community Budgets allow providers of local services to contribute to a shared fund, so they can co-ordinate their work more effectively and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investment-in-buildings-land-vehicles-and-machinery"&gt;Investment in buildings, land, vehicles and machinery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils need to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/investment-in-local-government-capital-assets" title="Investment in local government capital assets"&gt;invest in their capital assets&lt;/a&gt;, including buildings, land, vehicles and machinery. We will ensure that the system gives councils the resources and flexibilities to make this investment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="localising-council-tax-support"&gt;Localising Council Tax support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From April 2013, councils in England will design their own &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/localising-council-tax-support" title="Localising Council Tax support"&gt;Council Tax support schemes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="local-government-resource-review"&gt;Local government resource review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government set up a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06030" title="Review of local government resource"&gt;review of local government resources&lt;/a&gt; in March 2011 to consider how to give local councils more control over their money. The first phase of the review considered how local authorities could promote local economic growth by allowing them to keep at least a proportion of the locally generated business rates (the tax paid by businesses to local councils). This would replace the current formula grant arrangements which are a combination of business rates, revenue support grant and police grant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phase of the local government resource review looked at extending financial autonomy to communities and local people through &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2/supporting-pages/community-budgets" title="Community Budgets"&gt;Community Budgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="local-government-funding"&gt;Local government funding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities fund their activities from 3 main sources: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grants from central government &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Council Tax &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;other locally generated fees and charges for services &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central government funding for local councils is announced each year in the annual local government finance settlement. In 2012 to 2013, the finance settlement includes formula grant. For 2012 to 2013 formula grant is £28 billion, an average reduction of 7.2% on the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) ran a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/localising-support-for-council-tax" title="Localising Council Tax support consultation"&gt;consultation on proposals to localise support for Council Tax&lt;/a&gt; between 2 August and 14 October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also ran a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/localising-support-for-council-tax-funding-arrangements" title="Localising Council Tax support: funding arrangements"&gt;funding consultation&lt;/a&gt; from 17 May to 12 July 2012. The consultation paper explained how the government intends to distribute funding to support local schemes. It included proposals to adjust the way money is allocated to authorities, to make sure all authorities have what they need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/localising-support-for-council-tax-council-tax-base" title="Localising Council Tax support: Council Tax base"&gt;consultation paper on the Council Tax base&lt;/a&gt; and funding for local precepting authorities. Precepting authorities are councils from other levels of local government such as a county or parish councils and other agencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/business-rates-retention" title="Business rates retention"&gt;consulted on our proposals for a business rates retention scheme&lt;/a&gt; in summer 2011. We set out our proposition for a new business rate retention scheme on 19 December 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; also regularly meets and consults with representatives from local councils and other organisations involved in local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/localgovernmentfinance.html" title="Local Government Finance Act"&gt;Local Government Finance Act&lt;/a&gt; gained Royal assent on 31 October 2012. It provides a legal basis for business rates retention and localising Council Tax support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities must have regard to the ‘Prudential code for capital finance in local authorities’ when carrying out their duties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in England and Wales under &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/26/contents" title="Local Government Act 2003"&gt;Part 1 of the Local Government Act 2003&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in Scotland under &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/1/part/7" title="Local Government in Scotland Act 2003"&gt;Part 7 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in Northern Ireland under &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2011/10/enacted" title="Local Government Finance Act (Northern Ireland) 2011"&gt;Part 1 of the Local Government Finance Act (Northern Ireland) 2011&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="localising-council-tax-support-1"&gt;Localising Council Tax support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prescribed Requirements regulations prescribe requirements for all local Council Tax reduction schemes and come into force on 27 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note for Prescribed Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedules 1 to 6 apply to pensioners (as defined) only &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schedules 7 to 8 apply to all applicants (ie working age and pensioners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Default Scheme Regulations, which prescribe the default Council Tax reduction scheme which will apply to any council which has not made its on scheme on or before 31 January 2013, comes into force on 18 December 2012.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Default Scheme Regulations contain provisions about applicants in receipt of an award of universal credit, and we will be publishing a further guidance note on this approach, with worked examples.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cash boost to get England cycling</title>
    <summary>An extra £20 million for cycle infrastructure</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities, towns and villages across England are set to benefit from an extra £20 million for cycle infrastructure.  The new funding was announced today by Transport Minister Norman Baker, at a conference in Leicester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new funding will help people take to two wheels.  Projects could include better cycle facilities at railway stations, improved cycle links, or projects to improve the layout of road junctions to make them more cycle-friendly. Previous investment has seen some great projects making a real difference in communities, including better cycle routes from residential areas to schools to encourage the next generation of cyclists to cycle more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s conference in Leicester, attended by Public Health Minister Anna Soubry and Norman Baker, explores how councils’ health and transport officials can work better together to deliver better options for cycling and walking in their local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is great for your health, the economy, and for the environment so we are determined to make it easier for people to cycle whether for leisure, getting to the shops or as part of their commute to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Following the success of the Olympics, there is a huge appetite for more cycling provision from the travelling public and we need to capitalise on this enthusiasm at local and national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why we are investing £20 million in cycling infrastructure and getting councils to bring an end to silo working in their offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Health Minister Anna Soubry said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being active helps us stay healthy and protects against life threatening conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is a great way for adults to get their recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week and this funding will help encourage more people to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £20 million announced today is in addition to £30 million already announced for similar projects this year which drew in an additional £15 million in matched funding from local sources.  The projects to be funded will be announced later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/additional-funding-for-cycling-infrastructure"&gt;written statement&lt;/a&gt; was laid in Parliament this morning &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence today also published new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/"&gt;guidance on public health for local authorities&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Additional funding for cycling infrastructure</title>
    <summary>An additional £20m for existing infrastructure projects to support cycling.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government has today made available an additional £20m for our existing infrastructure projects to support cycling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding will increase the total available for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Community Linking Places Fund (in addition to the £15m announced on 7 February 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving cycle safety at junctions (in addition to the £15m announced on 26 June 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Community Linking Places Fund is primarily for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure, facilities and links. This includes improving access to the rail network by bicycle. In addition the fund aims to support jobs, enhance access to employment and encourage greater use of more environmentally friendly transport.   Projects currently being supported were announced on 6 March 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in junctions - for use by English local authorities outside London - will help to tackle accident hotspots where cyclists have been killed or seriously injured, or are deemed to be at greater risk.  Local authorities are currently submitting bids for funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand from local authorities, Sustrans and train operating companies, who are delivering the infrastructure, has been high.  An increase of £20m to the total funding available will allow the Government to support more high quality proposals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the projects to be supported under the additional funding will be published early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Green light for Weston transport improvements</title>
    <summary>Work on a new package of public transport and road improvement measures in Weston-super-Mare has been given final approval today. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on a new package of public transport and road improvement measures in Weston-super-Mare can now start after receiving final approval from Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will support economic growth in Weston-super-Mare and reduce congestion in the town centre. The work will also improve links between local roads and the M5 motorway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improvements to increase capacity of the M5 Junction 21&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new link road for buses to access Worle railway station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bus priority measures at junctions and bus only sections to improve bus access to the south of Worle Station, linking it with regeneration areas at Weston Airfield and Locking Parklands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new 320 space car park with a bus interchange, drop-off and cycle facilities together with improvements to the north-side car park at Worle Station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increased capacity between the town centre and the regeneration areas through road widening and new routes for pedestrians and cyclists as well as bus priority measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a great scheme that will support employment, reduce congestion and make it easier for people using public transport in and around Weston-super-Mare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The £10.4 million we are putting into this scheme shows that the coalition government is serious about investing in the infrastructure the country and the region needs to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weston package scheme was one of the schemes given funding approval last year as part of the Spending Review process.  Work is currently planned to start in March 2013 with the package scheduled to open in April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today’s announcement grants full (final) approval to the Weston package scheme enabling work to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The package of measures, promoted by North Somerset Council, is scheduled to open in April 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
