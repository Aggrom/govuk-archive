    <title>Campaign to reward designated drivers launched by Coca-Cola Great Britain and THINK!</title>
    <summary>Designated drivers will be rewarded with a buy 1 get 1 free deal on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero this Christmas. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designated drivers will be rewarded with a ‘buy 1 get 1 free’ deal on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero, this Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the winter period designated drivers across the UK will give lifts to friends and family as they enjoy a festive night out at pubs and bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain and the Road Safety Minister, Stephen Hammond MP, will today celebrate and pledge to reward responsible drivers, at the launch of this year’s designated driver campaign at the Mason Arms pub in Central London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in its 5th year the nationwide designated driver campaign will reward drivers who choose not to drink alcohol with a ‘buy 1, get 1 free’ offer on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and CokeZero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme will run for 3 weeks from 6 to 31 December and is part of an ongoing partnership with the THINK! driver friendly campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated website has also been set up to encourage consumers to take advantage of the offer. From the 6 December designated drivers and their friends can visit &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/"&gt;http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/designated-driver/&lt;/a&gt; to find a participating pub in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hammond, Road Safety Minister, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our THINK! campaign makes it clear that drink drivers risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am pleased that THINK! will be teaming up with Coca-Cola and pub chains across the country to reward designated drivers as well as reminding people of the consequences of getting a drink drive conviction. No one wants to spend their Christmas in a police cell.  My message is clear: don’t drink and drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Woods, General Manager, Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Designated drivers provide an amazing service to friends and family. They allow people to have a good night and also help keep roads safe, so everyone can enjoy the Christmas period.  By rewarding drivers who choose not to drink with a free Coke, Diet Coke or Coke Zero, we hope even more people will be encouraged to do the right thing and become responsible drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kieron Murphy, Licensee, Masons Arms: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We see a lot of people come in over the Christmas period who are responsible for driving their friends and family home at the end of the night.  That’s why we are delighted to be participating in Coca-Cola’s designated driver campaign this year.  It will reward our regulars and make sure they still have a good night out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch event will take place on 6 December (7.30-9am) at the Mason Arms, Maddox Street, London. The designated driver campaign forms part of Coca-Cola Great Britain’s pledge to promote the positive role in which soft drinks can play as credible alternatives to alcohol. The designated driver campaign is a key feature of Coca-Cola Great Britain’s overall commitment to responsible marketing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="about-the-research"&gt;About the research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research was conducted by Populus for Coca-Cola in November 2011 with 2000 adults. Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;79% of women have used a designated driver at the end of a night out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;men are more likely to abstain from alcohol with 63% having given it up to drive friends/family home before &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;62% of adults plan to go to a pub or bar over the Christmas and New Year period&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two thirds of those aged 65+ have been a designated driver compared to just over half of 18-24 year olds &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;however 18-24 year olds will give the most lifts over the Christmas and New Year period, on average taking 5 people &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the majority of those polled never drive home after drinking more than one alcoholic drink on a night out (83%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nearly half of respondents thought that the best thing about designated drivers is that they stop people drink driving, while 3 in 4 believe it is because they ensure people can get home safely at the end of a night out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="about-coca-cola-great-britain"&gt;About Coca-Cola Great Britain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Great Britain is responsible for marketing 21 brands and over 100 products to consumers across Great Britain, focusing upon developing new brands, extending existing brands and protecting trademarks including Coca-Cola (recognised as the world’s most valuable brand). Other Coca-Cola Great Britain brands include Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Fanta, Sprite, Dr Pepper, Oasis, Glaecauvitaminwater, Oasis, Schweppes, 5 Alive, Lilt, Kia Ora, Relentless Energy Drink and Powerade. The Coca-Cola Great Britain portfolio is worth £1,998 million with value sales growth of 8.4% year on year.

&lt;h3 id="about-the-think-drink-drive-campaign-and-driver-friendly-initiative"&gt;About the THINK! drink drive campaign and driver friendly initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of people killed in drink drive accidents has been reduced by over three-quarters since 1979 thanks to more than 30 years of government education campaigns and measures to improve enforcement. However, drink driving is still a problem and provisional statistics show that 280 people lost their lives in drink drive accidents on Britain’s road in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The THINK! campaign has had a long-standing and well supported partnership with the on-trade and soft drinks industry. In December 2009, this was developed into the ‘driver friendly’ campaign which aims to support the designated driver through the provision of promotional offers and ‘rewards’, linked to the purchase of soft drinks, on their night out. Coca-Cola GB is leading the way for Christmas 2012, and their designated driver promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Full speed ahead as government appoints new Director General to oversee HS2</title>
    <summary>David Prout to be Director General taking charge of the delivery of HS2.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s commitment to delivering a new national high speed rail network has been underlined by the appointment of a new Director General to oversee the crucial project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/government/people/david-prout"&gt;David Prout&lt;/a&gt;, currently a Director General at the Department of Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;), will join the Department for Transport (DfT) in the New Year in a newly-created post taking charge of the delivery of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a national high speed rail network linking London, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, the East Midlands, with each other and cities beyond it, to drive regional growth, improve connectivity and create extra space and capacity on our railways and roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his current role, David Prout has been at &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; since 2009, with responsibility for localism, and additional responsibility as deputy for &lt;a href="/government/people/bob-kerslake"&gt;Sir Bob Kerslake&lt;/a&gt; given the latter’s role as Head of the Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/government/people/philip-rutnam"&gt;Philip Rutnam, DfT Permanent Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a hugely important programme for the future of the UK. I am very pleased that David Prout will be taking charge at such an exciting time. He will be leading a team which is already hard at work delivering this project, as well as liaising closely with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; Ltd, as we work together to introduce the legislation into Parliament on time next year that will make &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Prout said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Making &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; a reality is absolutely crucial to our country’s future prosperity and I am very pleased to have been asked to take leadership of this much-needed programme at this time. I look forward to helping to take the project through Parliament and continuing to demonstrate the very real need for more capacity for people and freight on our railways, which will help make Britain a more prosperous and less congested country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>THINK! Don’t drink drive this Christmas</title>
    <summary>THINK! and the Association of Chief Police Officers are joining forces to warn about drink driving this Christmas.
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;THINK! and the Association of Chief Police Officers (&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;) are joining forces to warn drivers that getting behind the wheel after a festive tipple could see them end up behind bars this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting television advert highlighting the consequences of drink driving will be shown throughout December as part of the Department for Transport’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; today also launched its anti-drink and drug driving enforcement campaign, warning that young drivers and people driving the morning after a night of drinking pose a huge risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drivers should be in no doubt that if they get behind the wheel after drinking this Christmas, they risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Christmas should be a time for a celebration not a night in the cells. That is why our TV advert reminds drivers of the consequences of a drink drive conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, 280 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. Our message is clear: Do not let a selfish decision ruin your life or someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; roads policing lead, Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t drink and drive this Christmas you reduce the risk of killing an innocent person, or yourself. It is really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an absolute scourge on our society and shameful that in 2012 some drivers fail to realise the impact of drink or drug driving. Next year’s figures could include them or one of their family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, drivers aged between 20 and 24 failed more breath tests than any other age group. This year’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign is aimed at young people who are shown to be consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures.* &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s enforcement campaign targets well-intentioned drivers who do not think they are breaking the law but may be over the legal limit by the time they get into their cars in the morning. Police forces will be taking to roads across the country to stop and check drivers. Those found to be over the limit will face prosecution, which can lead to a jail sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCC Davenport added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some drivers who think they are obeying the law but are in fact breaking it by getting into their cars the morning after a night of drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People may be surprised to hear that last year between the hours of 6am and 11am more than 400 people failed breath tests (or refused to provide a specimen), which is more than those caught for the hour before or after midnight. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drivers need to be aware that regardless of the time of day they are caught, whether they are going to work or taking children to school, they will face the same penalties as someone who has chosen to drink heavily in a pub and driven at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Gifford, Executive Director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is good to see the department re-launching the Christmas drink-drive campaign. This advert reminds drivers that the choice is theirs but the responsibility for the wrong choice will stay with them for years to come. If in doubt, do not try to mix two activities. Stay sober at Christmas and during the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the THINK! campaign, the Department for Transport is currently consulting on a package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers. This includes removing drink drivers’ rights to demand a blood or urine test. This is because evidence shows it is used as a delaying tactic by drivers caught over the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is provisionally estimated that 2011 saw 280 deaths, 1290 serious injuries and 9,990 total casualties directly related to drink driving incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The THINK! Christmas Drink Drive campaign budget totals £783,925 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The THINK! TV advert - Moment of Doubt - will be aired 4 December to 23 December. For a high-resolution copy of the advert contact the Department for Transport’s press office on 020 7944 6898&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;THINK! campaign posters can be downloaded directly from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://think.direct.gov.uk/drink-driving.html"&gt;campaign site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Christmas campaign runs from 1 December 2012 to 1 January 2013 &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Institute of Advanced Motorists </title>
    <summary>A broad overview of some of the government’s key road safety priority areas.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank-you also for asking me along - it’s an absolute pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="not-complacent"&gt;Not complacent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I took up my post I inherited a road safety record second to none. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This country is a genuine world leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean for a single minute that it’s ‘job done’ or ‘mission accomplished’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, the provisional figures for the year ending June 2012 show a reduction in fatalities compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, it is very welcome news that, for all road users, the numbers killed and seriously injured are down 17% compared with the 2005-2009 average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s also worth remembering that, while the 2011 figures were slightly up on 2010, the 2010 figures were exceptionally low, and that 2011 was still lower than 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in spite of all we have achieved, we should never forget that road deaths are not statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are someone’s mother or father, brother or sister, son or daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are real lives cut short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as Simon (Simon Best – &lt;abbr title="Institute of Advanced Motorists"&gt;IAM&lt;/abbr&gt;) reminded us, road accidents also hit the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers and the graphs may change from year to year, but one thing stays constant - accidents carry a heavy human cost and a huge economic price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why this government is not complacent on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we will continue to do all we can to make our roads safer in our ambition to be the safest we can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the short time I have today I don’t want to talk you through every last dot and comma of the government’s road safety agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I would like to do is give you an insight into my thinking around some of the key priority areas as I see them - a brief but broad overview if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="localism"&gt;Localism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let me touch on an issue Simon mentioned in his speech - the important road safety role of local authorities, especially in terms of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are testing economic times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I recognise that local government, just like central government, faces tough spending choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know that it is local communities, rather than Whitehall bureaucrats, who are best placed to design local road safety solutions to meet local road safety challenges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that includes deciding where to focus their resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what localism is all about - the power to choose for yourself, backed by the funding to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are giving more than £1 billion to local councils enabling them to improve the transport infrastructure – including the design of better and safer roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re investing £600 million in local transport through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund – which again gives authorities greater power to deliver their own transport projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Transport for Manchester secured £32.5 million from the Fund for their ‘Let’s get to work project’ - a project designed to give people the kind of viable travel options that allow them to make their journey to work in way that is healthier and safer, cleaner and greener, whether it’s walking, cycling or hopping on the local bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the &lt;abbr title="Local Sustainable Transport Fund"&gt;LSTF&lt;/abbr&gt; projects contain a cycling element – not just providing better routes, but also making roads safer for cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take the issue of cycle safety very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial at a time when thousands of people are taking up bike riding - inspired by the heroics of our Tour de France, Olympic and Paralympic cyclists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the department has recently launched a THINK! cycle safety campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made £30 million available to tackle dangerous junctions for cyclists across the country&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have made it simpler for councils to put in place 20mph zones - and install Trixi mirrors to improve the visibility of cyclists at junctions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycle safety is about embracing technology and changing behaviour. So we will continue to develop new ideas and initiatives to build on the progress we’ve already made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="drug-driving"&gt;Drug driving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that one of the great successes of road safety over the last 40 years has been the extent to which drink driving has become socially unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the number of drink drive deaths has fallen by more than 75% since 1979. The culture has completely changed from social necessity to social pariah, such is the view of today’s drink drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sadly, people are still losing their lives because of drink drive collisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;280 were killed last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, through our award winning THINK Campaign, we continue to push home the message that people who drive while over the limit risk losing their licence, being fined or even going to prison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, they have to be aware that they could injure, or worse kill someone – including someone they love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve also just launched a drink-drive consultation which includes proposals to close down the legal loopholes where some drivers try to avoid prosecution by demanding to replace their breath test with blood or urine tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink driving kills. Fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in my view, it is just as socially unacceptable and dangerous to drive while impaired by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we tackled drink driving in the 1980s, now in the 2010s, it’s time to defeat drug driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I believe we have to make sure that drug drivers face the full force of the law, just like drink drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the government is taking three major steps to do just that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type approval will shortly be given to drug testing devices for police stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we expect to introduce road-side drug screeners during 2014&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and the new law to prosecute drug-drivers will also come into come into effect by the summer of 2014 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government is on the side of the motoring majority who abide by the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to the reckless minority of drivers who think they can take drugs, jump behind the wheel and get away with it, my message is clear and it’s simple - you will be caught and you will be punished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-hard-core-few-and-the-law-abiding-many"&gt;The hard core few and the law abiding many&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now say a few words about the hard core few and the law abiding many. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re targeting enforcement efforts against the dangerous behaviour of the hardcore few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drivers who commit serious, deliberate and repeated offences - the ones with a poor attitude rather than poor skills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told you about cracking down on drink drivers. But there’s no hiding place for the uninsured either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, for example, we’re making full use of existing powers to seize an offender’s vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police seized around 140,000 vehicles for this offence last year, and the level of uninsured driving has decreased from around 2 million drivers in 2005 to 1.2 million drivers in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also introduced the continuous insurance enforcement scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurance industry estimate that, with the introduction of this scheme - assuming that police enforcement continues at its current rate - the level of uninsured driving could be reduced by up to 40% in the next 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the law abiding many that’s good news, both for road safety and, I hope, for future insurance premiums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe it’s absolutely vital to support the law abiding many.
The motorists who want to do the right thing and who just need a nudge in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, that means offering more educational options to drivers who make genuine mistakes, display poor skills or commit occasional low level offences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means improving training and testing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason we’ve made changes to the practical portion of the driving test so that, instead of being taught how to pass a test, people will actually learn how to drive safely on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s why we want to tackle careless driving with proportionate sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 June, the government consulted on proposals to make careless driving a fixed penalty offence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorists who commit less severe examples of the offence - such as driving too close to another vehicle - would be offered training to help them improve their safety skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if anyone knows the benefits of driver education and training, then it’s this Institution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You understand the positive impact it can have on road safety by preventing collisions and crashes from taking place in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="older-drivers"&gt;Older drivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also recognise the impact of changing demographics on motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so do I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Simon pointed out, with an ageing population the number of older drivers on our roads is set to increase over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the report you’ve just launched about older drivers is a welcome contribution to the on-going debate about what this might mean for road safety and road users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the overall aim must be to maintain a balance between freedom of movement for older drivers and road safety for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; is not considering compulsory testing for older drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned the crucial factor for road safety is not age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is skills and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is the physical and mental fitness of the driver to drive competently and safely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that applies to young drivers as well as older drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognise that we have to do everything we can to make sure young motorists are as safe as they can be on our highways, whether they are driving on the motorway, through town or along country lanes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the safety and ability of young drivers is a key priority for the government which is why we have adapted the driving test to reflect real conditions on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of ongoing measures to reduce the risks of accidents, the department is working with young people, the insurance industry, and other partners to identify what more can be done - and we are considering several options to ensure that newly qualified drivers are properly prepared and able to drive safely &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the use of telematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-car technology like this means insurers now have a real time data feed which allows them to see an individual’s driving behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some evidence suggests that young drivers could see their annual premiums fall by 20% more with a black box installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But research so far also shows that telematics can significantly reduce crash rates and levels of risky driving behaviours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome the increasing number of insurers who are making use of this technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are supportive of any measures that make driving safer and also want to see improvements in young driver safety reflected in their insurance premiums. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I was always taught that there isn’t much point in silent gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as well as thanking everyone here for your hospitality today, I’d also like to say a big ‘thank-you’ to the Institute itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you don’t just campaign for safer roads - you actively do something to make them a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than half a century you have raised driving and riding standards and improved the skills of road users, both on two wheels and four wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down the years you have helped to prevent accidents, save lives and make Britain’s highways some of the safest on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as the Road Safety Minister, I want to pay tribute to everyone at the Institute - your hard work and your expertise makes a real and lasting difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK Air-Rail Conference</title>
    <summary>The economic importance of air-rail connections, and the government’s record of investment and modernisation.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along, it’s a genuine pleasure to be here this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-nation-was-ever-ruined-by-trade"&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Benjamin Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers, who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That statement was spot on when Ben Franklin made it back in the 18th century and it is spot on today, in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade is Britain’s economic lifeblood. We’re an island nation that’s at our best when we’re a trading nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the very reason this government is re-balancing our economy - moving Britain from a ‘spend and borrow’ past to a ‘make and sell’ future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if they’re going to trade, then our entrepreneurs have to connect - connect with customers and markets, connect with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the modern world that usually means a business trip and a seat on a plane - which also means a journey to an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why air-rail links matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the theme of your conference rightly reminds us, these links are all about ‘connecting for growth’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now ‘growth’ is the word on everyone’s lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s hardly surprising in these testing times of a Eurozone crisis, a fragile global economy and a record-breaking inherited debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while there is sill a long way to go, recent economic figures show we are moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do think there is a tendency in some quarters to talk about growth as though it’s an abstract concept - something that’s separate and stand-alone; something with a life-force all of its very own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as though some commentators believe growth will magically appear of its own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that it’ll come about if you say the word often enough, or you want it badly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well actually, out there in the real world, you can’t talk or wish an economy into growing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t wave a wand and conjure up growth from thin air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can’t sit back and wait for it to fall in your lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth comes through hard slog: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the competitive company and the skilled workforce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the inventors and innovators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the risk takers and wealth creators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and yes… a supportive and empowering government &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is who and what drives growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where transport can play such a massive part - by providing the vital connections that help to support and sustain growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the bottom line is - the government understands the overriding economic imperative of modernising our railways, our airports and the links between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="railways"&gt;Railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take each of those areas in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the railways, where we’re engaged in a massive effort to renew and rebuild Britain’s rail networks - and just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to electrify more than 850 miles of track, compared to the 10 miles electrified by the last administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, right across the country, we’re making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our focus doesn’t begin and end with the conventional railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recognise the huge potential benefits of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re going to build with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only links London and Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will, of course, give people much quicker journey times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is so much more than simply a faster way to get from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; also means more capacity and better connected cities and regions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets, win new customers and attract new investment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will create and support tens of thousands of jobs and so help to power up the recovery and put people back to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to deliver better life chances for millions of people by opening up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a persuasive environmental case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because it will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no exaggeration to say that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make no mistake - the government’s commitment to this game-changing project is full on and flat out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="airports"&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the subject of airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity in a box-shaped biplane made of spruce and covered in cotton, air travel has shrunk our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons, personal and business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So airports have a front and centre role in keeping our country prosperous, as well as keeping it connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we’re working hard to make sure the aviation sector continues to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Civil Aviation Bill, legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve consulted on our draft Aviation Policy Framework - a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to increase reliability and reduce delays, we’ve been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thinking ahead too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about the future as just the next 4 or 5 years, but in terms of the next 4 and 5 decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about what those solutions should look like including, I’m sure, many of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports’ Commission to explore the evidence, consider the options and make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Howard has now named the members of his commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its terms of reference have been published. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of work is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let me be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to this country’s aviation needs, and we believe that the Airports’ Commission is the way to do precisely that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="air-rail-links"&gt;Air-rail links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you take a look at this country’s major airports you will probably notice any number of things that mark them out and make them unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look again though and you’ll also see there are 2 things they have in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they act as global gateways to new markets and new customers - which means they are not just national transport assets, they are national economic assets too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But second, they’re set to become much easier places to get to and fly from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because we’re making real and lasting improvements to those crucial connections between the train and the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me highlight some of the key investments and modernisations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;electrification of the Midland Mainline improves access to Luton, while Valleys electrification improves access to Cardiff Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;electrification and capacity enhancements between Leamington and Coventry enables more Crosscountry trains to run via Birmingham Airport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra platform capacity at Redhill means more opportunity for Gatwick services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in Greater Manchester the Metrolink tram extension is due to open in 2016 and will take passengers from the city centre into Manchester Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as part of the Northern Hub improvements, there will be an extra platform at Manchester Airport, which will allow more and longer trains to serve the airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;investment in the Ordsall Chord and additional platforms at Piccadilly station means that trains from Bradford, Halifax and Rochdale will be able to get to Manchester Airport for the first time &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new £500 million rail link will give direct western access to Heathrow Airport and is expected to cut passenger journey times from the Thames Valley, the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands by around half an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;once it’s completed, Crossrail will provide new services linking Heathrow with the West End, the City of London and Canary Wharf.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to Thameslink, Gatwick will get new direct services to destinations north of London, such as Cambridge, Stevenage and Welwyn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, not only will &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; make it much easier for passengers from London and the south-east to get to Birmingham Airport… &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will also mean that people and businesses in the Midlands and the north of England get improved access to Heathrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an impressive list of projects and programmes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you add it all up, what you get are train services that work for rail passengers and air passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay - whenever I make a speech I’m always conscious of the words of President Bill Clinton who gave the following advice about public speaking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if you can’t say what you want to say in 20 minutes or less, you should go away and write a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m sure that lovers of literature everywhere will be greatly relieved to know that I have no plans whatsoever to be an author - which means it’s time for me to conclude my speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I finish up though there’s something I want you to know, and it’s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting for growth isn’t just at the top of your priority list – it’s right at the heart of our transport policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seamless air-rail journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better, faster, closer links between the station platform and the check-in desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our vision, that’s our ambition and, step by step, that’s what we’re delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cash boost to get England cycling</title>
    <summary>An extra £20 million for cycle infrastructure</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities, towns and villages across England are set to benefit from an extra £20 million for cycle infrastructure.  The new funding was announced today by Transport Minister Norman Baker, at a conference in Leicester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new funding will help people take to two wheels.  Projects could include better cycle facilities at railway stations, improved cycle links, or projects to improve the layout of road junctions to make them more cycle-friendly. Previous investment has seen some great projects making a real difference in communities, including better cycle routes from residential areas to schools to encourage the next generation of cyclists to cycle more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s conference in Leicester, attended by Public Health Minister Anna Soubry and Norman Baker, explores how councils’ health and transport officials can work better together to deliver better options for cycling and walking in their local areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is great for your health, the economy, and for the environment so we are determined to make it easier for people to cycle whether for leisure, getting to the shops or as part of their commute to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Following the success of the Olympics, there is a huge appetite for more cycling provision from the travelling public and we need to capitalise on this enthusiasm at local and national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That is why we are investing £20 million in cycling infrastructure and getting councils to bring an end to silo working in their offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Health Minister Anna Soubry said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being active helps us stay healthy and protects against life threatening conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cycling is a great way for adults to get their recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week and this funding will help encourage more people to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The £20 million announced today is in addition to £30 million already announced for similar projects this year which drew in an additional £15 million in matched funding from local sources.  The projects to be funded will be announced later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Relocation of Falkirk driving test centre to Grangemouth</title>
    <summary>This initial screening was carried out to find out the impact of relocating the driving test centre at Falkirk to Grangemouth.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) has closed the driving test centre at Falkirk and opened a new one in Grangemouth. This is to improve facilities for driving examiners and candidates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new test centre opened on 9 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; considers that driving test candidates and staff won’t have any significant or detrimental impact on their journeys to the centre, or on its driving test routes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new centre is easily accessible via the network of main roads in the area. It’s located 4.2 miles away from the original centre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
