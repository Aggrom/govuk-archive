    <title>UK condemns Palestinian refugee camp bombing in Damascus</title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt has condemned the attack by the Syrian regime which killed at least 20 people yesterday.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on reports of Syrian government air strikes on the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I condemn the Syrian regime’s aerial bombardment of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, which killed at least 20 people yesterday. They are among four hundred Syrians killed across the country this weekend in yet another tragic reminder that the Assad regime continues to attack its own people with brutality and without remorse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Syrian government actions have already driven hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians from their homes into neighboring countries. The senseless targeting of Palestinian refugees, who had hitherto looked to Syria for shelter and protection, will only exacerbate the risk of contagion across the region. Our objective remains an end to the violence and a transition to a more democratic and stable Syria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Supporting the Overseas Territories</title>
    <summary>Working with the Overseas Territories on the challenges they face and encouraging strong local economies.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a broad responsibility to support the Overseas Territories and to ensure their security and good governance. Britain and territory governments share significant challenges: building more diverse and resilient economies; cutting public sector deficits; regulating finance businesses effectively; and protecting biodiversity and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-overseas-territories-programme-fund"&gt;The Overseas Territories Programme Fund&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overseas Territories Programme Fund supports the work of government to maintain the security, stability and prosperity of the Overseas Territories. This fund supports the economic, security, environmental and governance strategies in the government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/publications/overseas-territories-white-paper-0612/ot-wp-0612"&gt;white paper on the Overseas Territories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Where-we-work/Overseas-Territories/"&gt;Department for International Development (&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; provides budgetary support for Montserrat, Pitcairn and St Helena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/ovseas-terr-dept-2011.pdf"&gt;Department for International Development’s Operational Plan 2011-2015&lt;/a&gt; explains how money is allocated to the territories and how expenditure is monitored for effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="environment-and-climate-fund-darwin-plus"&gt;Environment and climate fund: Darwin Plus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government launched &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/10/17/2-million-a-year-overseas-territories-fund/"&gt;Darwin Plus: Overseas Territories Environment and Climate Fund&lt;/a&gt;, an environment and climate fund for the UK’s Overseas Territories, in October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fund consists of contributions from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (&lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;DEFRA&lt;/abbr&gt;), and &lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;. The fund will disburse around £2 million per year dedicated to a range of environment and climate-related projects to improve long-term natural resource management in the Overseas Territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guidance and application forms for the fund are available on &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;DEFRA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://darwin.defra.gov.uk/news/2012-10/darwin-plus/%20%E2%80%9CDarwin%20Initiative%E2%80%9D"&gt;Darwin Initiative website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="protecting-the-overseas-territories"&gt;Protecting the Overseas Territories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the UK’s main military tasks is to provide security to the nation and its overseas territories. The Ministry of Defence (&lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;) published a security policy in 2011, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/1AD4AFE6-4946-4BAC-A3A6-7AFBF9AA25BF/0/overseas_territories.pdf"&gt;Overseas Territories: the Ministry of Defence’s contribution&lt;/a&gt;, which explains how the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; will protect the Overseas Territories from 2012 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="supporting-the-public-sectors"&gt;Supporting the public sectors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have set up the Jubilee Programme to share experience between public servants in the territories and the UK by giving territory officials opportunities to train and work with colleagues in the UK, and vice versa, encouraging long-term partnerships between the territories and public bodies in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Overseas Territories are very diverse, with thousands of small islands, vast areas of ocean, but also, in Antarctica, land 6 times the size of the United Kingdom. They include one of the world’s richest communities, in Bermuda; the most remote community, in Tristan da Cunha and one of the smallest, with only 54 people living on Pitcairn Island. The total population of the territories is roughly a quarter of a million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 14 British Overseas Territories and most have a permanent resident population. The exceptions are the British Indian Ocean Territory and the British Antarctic Territory, and South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. The latter two have research stations. The Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus have a resident population of Cypriot nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14 Overseas Territories are:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Private Security Companies</title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds has updated parliament on the development of a regulatory system for private security companies.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government aims to raise the global standards of private security companies (&lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt;) working in complex and high risk environments overseas. To this end, we have been working closely with interested partners, including industry and civil society, to establish a voluntary, independently audited and internationally recognised regulatory system that is practicable, effective and affordable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certification to professional standards is the next step towards effective voluntary regulation. First the Government endorsed the Montreux Document in 2008, in which States commit to observe existing international legal obligations relevant to the operations of &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; in areas of armed conflict. Secondly, in 2010, an International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers (&lt;abbr title="International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers"&gt;ICOC&lt;/abbr&gt;) was created. This provides a set of principles to guide companies. The &lt;abbr title="International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers"&gt;ICOC&lt;/abbr&gt; has now been signed by over 500 &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt;, around a third of them British. We have reviewed options on setting new professional standards to make the Code effective. We now intend to issue an HMG publication specifying that ASIS PSC 1-2012 is the applicable standard for UK-based &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; working in complex environments on land overseas. I will place a copy of the publication in the libraries of both Houses. Companies, independent auditors and the UK Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="UK Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) will then take the further steps to enable auditing against these standards to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers"&gt;ICOC&lt;/abbr&gt; mandated the development of auditable standards to ensure that signatory companies are implementing their commitments under the code. In response to this requirement, the international security trade association, ASIS, was funded by the Department of Defense to develop the standard – ‘PSC1’ – for the regulation of private security companies operating on land in complex environments overseas. This standard was drafted in a multinational and multi-stakeholder forum in which UK Government, UK industry and UK civil society fully participated.  It was published in March 2012 as an approved American National Standard and is the only standard currently available for companies operating in this field. &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; seeking certification in the UK to this new standard will have to be audited by independent third party auditors accredited by &lt;abbr title="UK Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;. Our trade association partners, the Security in Complex Environments Group, will, in consultation with Government, develop guidance to help British &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; meet the requirements of the new standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ambition is to have a single, internationally agreed standard and we therefore welcome the fact that PSC1 was recently submitted to the International Standards Organisation (ISO) to be considered for adoption as an international standard for &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; working in complex environments. This process may take some time. We will review the need for a separate HMG publication of this standard once the ISO process has been completed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working with other States, industry and civil society internationally to ensure that there should be globally recognised standards and that UK companies are not unfairly disadvantaged by raising their standards. We expect that the &lt;abbr title="International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers"&gt;ICOC&lt;/abbr&gt; governing board, when established, will advise that certification to the PSC 1 standard by suitably accredited independent auditors will meet the Code’s requirements for &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; to have auditable professional standards. We are still consulting with industry and civil society partners on what additional steps &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; might need to take to obtain full certification by the &lt;abbr title="International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers"&gt;ICOC&lt;/abbr&gt; that they are meeting the Code’s principles but I can confirm that there will be no need for &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; to go through duplicate auditing procedures to become certified.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers"&gt;ICOC&lt;/abbr&gt; was drafted with land-based &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; in mind. However, since 2010 there has been a rapid rise in the number of &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; working on anti-piracy operations at sea. Although many of the principles relating to &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; working on land and at sea are similar, there are important legal and practical differences. The Government is therefore also contributing to an international drafting process under the ISO for an equivalent professional standard for &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; working in the maritime sector. A draft maritime standard was introduced at the International Maritime Organisation in late November. If and when this standard is adopted, &lt;abbr title="UK Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; will start the process of accrediting suitably qualified independent third party auditors to certify UK-based maritime &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; under it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarity on the standards against which &lt;abbr title="private security companies"&gt;PSCs&lt;/abbr&gt; should be audited is an important step forward in the drive to raise standards in this industry through voluntary action, but independently audited. It is also a practical illustration of the Government’s commitment to human rights and to working with business and civil society to find effective ways to implement our commitments even in the most challenging environments.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This week at the Foreign Office </title>
    <summary>A look at the work of the Foreign Office and its embassies overseas this week. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h4 id="syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary outlined the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-remarks-at-the-friends-of-syria-meeting" title="Foreign Secretary remarks at Friends of the Syrian People meeting"&gt;immediate priorities for the Friends of the Syrian People&lt;/a&gt; at the meeting in Marrakesh this week. He said “Syria needs a political transition leading to an inclusive new government, with full executive authority. This is the course most likely to achieve stability in the country.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="international-human-rights-day"&gt;International Human Rights Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On International Human Rights Day Baroness Warsi launched the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-baroness-warsi-marks-human-rights-day" title="Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi marks Human Rights Day"&gt;UK’s campaign for election to the Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;. She said: “We believe in a Human Rights Council that can make its voice heard, even when the issues are unpopular or difficult to hear.” The Foreign Office marked &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/" title="16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence"&gt;16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&lt;/a&gt; ending on Monday with a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/post/37632415718/helen-pankhurst" title="guest post"&gt;guest post from Dr. Helen Pankhurst&lt;/a&gt; from CARE international. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="foreign-office-website-moves-to-govuk"&gt;Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-website-moves-to-gov-uk" title="Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK"&gt;Foreign Office began publishing its news&lt;/a&gt;, speeches, policy, publications and corporate information on GOV.UK – the single home for all government services and information. Our travel advice and consular information, and our Embassy and High Commission websites will follow by March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea-dprk"&gt;Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-condemns-dprk-s-satellite-launch" title="Foreign Secretary condemns DPRK’s satellite launch"&gt;condemned the DPRK’s satellite launch&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday saying that the launch was a clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 because it involved the testing of ballistic missile technology. The Permanent Under Secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/north-korean-ambassador-summoned-to-foreign-and-commonwealth-office" title="DPRK Ambassador summoned"&gt;summoned the DPRK’s Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in London to the Foreign Office to make clear to the UK’s condemnation of the DPRK’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="parental-child-abduction"&gt;Parental Child Abduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New figures revealed that the number of parental child abduction cases dealt with by the Foreign Office has risen by 88% in under a decade. The child abduction section at the Foreign office launched a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/parental-child-abduction-is-a-worldwide-problem" title="Parental Child Abduction"&gt;campaign to increase understanding of the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-met-the-king-of-jordan" title="The Foreign Secretary met the King of Jordan"&gt;the Foreign Secretary met His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan&lt;/a&gt; they discussed the situation in Syria, the Middle East Peace Process and institute reforms in Jordan that would bring about greater political participation, transparency and economic opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that the Iranian investigation into the death of the blogger Sattar Beheshti whilst in custody had &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/iranian-investigation-into-detained-blogger-is-missed-opportunity-for-justice" title="Iranian investigation is missed opportunity for justice"&gt;failed to deliver justice&lt;/a&gt;. The Minister said: “The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="also-this-week"&gt;Also this week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington set out the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-europe-renews-uk-commitment-to-eu-enlargement" title="UK’s commitment to EU enlargement"&gt;UK’s commitment to EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister for Africa Mark Simmonds called for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-calls-for-an-immediate-return-to-civilian-rule-in-mali" title="UK calls for an immediate return to civilian rule in Mali"&gt;an immediate return to civilian rule in Mali&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt visited Libya to strengthen &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fco-minister-shows-continued-uk-support-to-libyan-people-on-trip-to-region" title="Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt visit to Libya"&gt;UK relations with the new Libyan government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>UK welcomes new counter terrorism centre in UAE</title>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt has welcomed the opening of a Centre of Excellence on Countering Violent Extremism in Abu Dhabi.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harnessing the broad experience and expertise of the 30 Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF) founding member nations, the Centre will lead global research on the drivers of terrorism, deliver training to address these, and identify practical, operational initiatives to reduce the threat from terrorism. It was launched at the third ministerial meeting of the GCTF in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which was attended by representatives from all member nations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from Tunisia, where he is on an official visit, Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s launch in Abu Dhabi of the Centre of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) is an important milestone in the global fight against terrorism. In particular I welcome the leadership that His Excellency Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed has shown and the Emirati commitment to host the Centre and make it a reality. The UK will continue to give it our full support. We have nominated an expert to serve as a Member of the International Steering Board and are seconding a Director of Training &amp;amp; Capacity-Building into the Centre’s senior management team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are determined to do our utmost to tackle the root causes of terrorism by ensuring a collaborative international approach to the common threat of terrorism.

    <title>Liam Fox: NATO support crucial to building Afghan forces</title>
    <summary>Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, has welcomed the rapid progress in training the Afghan National Security Forces, and the role of the NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan, but insisted that NATO allies still need to up their game.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He confirmed Afghanistan as the highest foreign policy priority of the new British Coalition Government, and the top priority for the Ministry of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the last day of his first NATO meeting in Brussels, Dr Fox said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The British Government supports both the mission and the counter-insurgency strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I encourage allies to demonstrate strategic patience and give time for the counter-insurgency strategy to work, but stress the need to be able to show significant progress, consolidating ISAF’s hold in central Helmand, and accelerating the training of the Afghan security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to step up our approach to communicating the vital importance of the mission in Afghanistan. We need to produce a stronger narrative alongside the political leadership we are providing to ensure that our troops get the support they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox emphasised that the NATO Training Mission is key to ISAF’s strategy for transition, to ensure the Afghans can take the lead in securing their own country in future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General McChrystal told this meeting that the Afghan National Security Forces [ANSF] are making quick progress in terms of training, but we still have some way to go in terms of improving the Afghan National Police and getting the numbers and quality of training up to the level we require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise the vital role of the training mission. We will assess whether we can contribute more and urge others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me be direct: we are aware of the difficulties that some countries face in sending combat troops - politically and even constitutionally. However, there is no excuse for any country here not to send trainers to the Afghan mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we fail in the NATO Training Mission it will signify a lack of political will and a failure of moral resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to ensure we can build up that critical mass of the ANSF, so that when we do leave Afghanistan, we leave behind a secure country, and not a security vacuum. There is a moral duty on every member of NATO to contribute to that training mission, and that’s the message I give to our NATO partners today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr Liam Fox (right) meets NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in Brussels" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5594/Liam_Fox-_NATO_support_crucial_to_building_Afghan_forces_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Liam Fox (right) meets NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in Brussels [Picture: NATO, 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox welcomed progress that is beginning to be made on planning for transition, in advance of the Kabul Conference in July:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important to ensure that both ISAF contributors and the Government of Afghanistan are involved in developing the plan for transition and that the process should be transparent, allowing ISAF partners to communicate progress towards transition to domestic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Security criteria should be the most important in assessing readiness for transition. Though some level of governance and development is essential for delivering security, we must not set the bar too high. Governance and development efforts will continue through and beyond transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox also reaffirmed that NATO remains the most important strategic relationship for the United Kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NATO is the core of the security and defence of all its members, on both sides of the Atlantic. It is the UK’s instrument of first resort for collective security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why NATO remains so important and so successful is its ability to change as risks and threats evolve. Afghanistan is one example of a task that would have been inconceivable a decade ago. Then the alliance was being told to go out of area or out of business. Today, it is very much in business but facing even greater challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox emphasised that NATO has primacy in terms of Europe’s security and the starting point should be that the EU only acts militarily when NATO cannot or chooses not to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I recognise, of course, that there will be occasions when it is appropriate for the EU to intervene but the EU should avoid duplicating the functions NATO already performs and the capabilities it already possesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In today’s economic climate, the last thing any Defence Minister needs to put to his or her Finance Minister or Generals is a case for militarily unnecessary duplication. NATO and the EU need the strongest possible links and what matters most is what works best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox expressed concern over the state of NATO’s finances but said that he was encouraged by the Secretary General’s report to members which made it clear that much has been done to bring these under proper control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During two days of meetings in NATO Headquarters, Defence Ministers discussed NATO reform, resources, capabilities and missile defence, and met in ISAF and KFOR formats to discuss Afghanistan and Kosovo. There were also meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Nuclear Planning Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the margins of the formal meetings, Dr Fox met the NATO Secretary General and the Defence Ministers of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Norway, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands, France, Afghanistan, Canada, Turkey, Portugal, Latvia, Australia, the United States and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Scots Guards home after handover to Afghan forces</title>
    <summary>Soldiers from the Scots Guards have returned home from Afghanistan after handing security in their area of Helmand over to Afghan forces.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 50 Guardsmen from the Right Flank of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/23989.aspx" title="1st Battalion Scots Guards"&gt;1st Battalion Scots Guards&lt;/a&gt; have returned to their barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, as the checkpoints they manned have been closed and the Afghan National Civil Order Police (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Civil Order Police"&gt;ANCOP&lt;/abbr&gt;) are now taking responsibility for security in Helmand’s Upper Gereshk Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots Guards are serving with Task Force Helmand, currently led by the British Army’s &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.army.mod.uk/structure/29027.aspx" title="4th Mechanized Brigade"&gt;4th Mechanized Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, known as ‘The Black Rats’, and the Right Flank form part of the first 500 British troops to be sent home from Afghanistan as announced by the Prime Minister last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The troops were based at Checkpoints ‘Barcha’ and ‘Pan Kalay’ and Observation Post ‘Tegha’ in the Upper Gereshk Valley - the northernmost area of operations for Task Force Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardsmen have been working alongside the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Civil Order Police"&gt;ANCOP&lt;/abbr&gt; to bring security and allow freedom of movement for traffic on Route 611, the main road between Sangin and Gereshk, but that job has been successfully handed over to the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Sayed Farid, the new Afghan Commander from the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Civil Order Police"&gt;ANCOP&lt;/abbr&gt;’s 5th Brigade taking over from the Scots Guards in Pan Kalay, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe all the Afghan forces are now well-equipped, well-armed and ready to take on the security of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since we have been here we have some really good relations with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/" title="Afghanistan International Security Assistance Force"&gt;&lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forces. They have really helped us out. We are only sad because our friends are leaving. They did their part of the job and we did ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Guardsman Alan Primrose " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5529/AMOCCCT-2012-240-295g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Guardsman Alan Primrose on board an RAF C-17 Globemaster aircraft at Camp Bastion [Picture: Corporal Jamie Peters RLC, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platoon Commander Second Lieutenant James Westlake, attached to the Right Flank from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/regiments/24680.aspx" title="Honourable Artillery Company"&gt;Honourable Artillery Company&lt;/a&gt;, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was quite apparent to everyone in the platoon, not just higher up, that the job is done. The time is right to be going back and the Afghan forces in those locations are ready to take over - there is just not a job for us to do by staying there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So everybody is satisfied that it is a job well done and, once you take that into account, everybody is looking forward to getting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checkpoints and observation post are the first on the main 611 highway in Task Force Helmand’s area of operations to be closed. During the closure process, the facilities were removed and the bases reduced to a more basic level for the few troops that remained until the final day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follwing some leave, the Scots Guards will be responsible for providing support to the battle groups deploying to Afghanistan in April 2013, when the Guardsmen will be reunited with the rest of the battalion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister announced last year that 500 British personnel would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2012, reflecting the continuing progress in Helmand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawdown is consistent with the process of transition to Afghan forces agreed by &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; nations at Lisbon in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has emphasised the UK’s commitment to Afghanistan for the long term, pledging £70 million per annum in funding for the Afghan security forces, in addition to the taking the lead in setting up an Afghan National Army Officers’ Academy in Kabul after the combat mission ends in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Soldiers offer ground expertise to aerial assets in Afghanistan </title>
    <summary>When ground troops find themselves in trouble on the front line they have the reassurance of knowing that help is invariably close at hand.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Army &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx" title="Apache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are often called upon to neutralise enemy threats, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" title="Royal Air Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; plays an equally important role with their impressive fleet of fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fearsome aerial assets fly out of Kandahar and, although the pilots and support crew are based well outside &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/" title="British Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; circles, they have direct access to all things green courtesy of skilled ground liaison officers (GLOs) who are embedded within their squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such personnel act as a link between the 2 Services to ensure those in the air have a clear understanding of the situation below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornado.cfm" title="Tornado GR4"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; Force’s War Week exercise at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/" title="RAF Marham"&gt;RAF Marham&lt;/a&gt;, Captain James Perring of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/24651.aspx" title="1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment"&gt;1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about taking everything that is happening on the ground and translating that into basic speak for the aircrew. They have no idea about the situation on the ground so we talk them through the process. I get involved with anything that is Army-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to give as much information as possible so when they are up in the sky they know where people are and what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring is now on a four-month deployment with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/9squadron.cfm" title="9 Squadron"&gt;9 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan and the serviceman was quick to highlight the differences between his roles with the RAF and Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Ground Liaison Officer"&gt;GLO&lt;/abbr&gt; is a posting I applied for and is something completely different. I had no idea or appreciation of how air assets work so it has given me great insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is going to be an interesting tour and in a way I will have a greater understanding of the bigger picture in Afghanistan compared to spending 6 months on foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5427/tornadosg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring joined the Tornado Force for the War Week exercise at RAF Marham [Picture: Graeme Main, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working with the RAF has been a bit of a culture shock. Sometimes the bureaucracy can be frustrating but it works for them and it is like that for a reason. It has been hard to adjust but there are positives to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring was not the only soldier involved in War Week. Major Jeremy Higgins of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/23445.aspx" title="Royal Artillery"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt;, a reservist who is a director for Cross Country Trains, was also on hand to offer expert advice and guidance from an Army perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise is designed to test personnel on the scenarios they are likely to face in theatre and the officer was determined to add as much realism as possible. Major Higgins said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to ensure the aircrew get the training they need ahead of the deployment, while tying in with other agencies such as forward air controllers. It is about orchestrating different elements in the air and on the ground so when the jets go out they get the training they require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will be talking to troops in the field beforehand, asking what they need and what they are trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The aircrew also highlight the areas they want to work on, such as night missions, and the soldiers come up with different scenarios for them. Effectively we have two serials feeding into one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a close link between the two forces, GLOs are mindful of not overloading their airborne colleagues with unfamiliar Army tactics and thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not just UK personnel who benefit from the support offered by the Tornado crews. Major Higgins explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Preparing a Tornado for take off" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5428/tornados3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;RAF personnel preparing a Tornado for take off at Kandahar Airfield (library image) [Picture: Corporal Andy Benson RAF, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be quite challenging as we cover the whole of Afghanistan and can be allocated anywhere. It is an international role and we have to get information from soldiers who do not have English as their first language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We give the aircrews some situational awareness and that can be quite important due to the various forces we work with. They have different kit, depending on what they are doing, so a footprint of life on the ground is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Toyota Hilux with guys in the back could be perceived as being the enemy, but it may also be local allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about adding value in any way we can. We may be asked simple questions or ones that completely floor us. We interact with land troops to get a picture of what they want from the fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for aerial assets is inevitably strong as soldiers maintain the Army’s operational tempo and such requests mean the RAF are on high alert during the training cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Lisa Foy, the acting officer in command of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/aboutus/opswg.cfm" title="RAF Marham - Operations Wing"&gt;RAF Marham’s Operations Wing&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is always more demand than we can meet but we strive to match the requirements from Land whenever possible. We want to benefit the personnel on exercise while training the Tornado crews as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise that the Force needs to train with soldiers and War Week is the perfect opportunity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A lot of 9 Squadron’s training during this phase has been provided by the Army, and GLOs are critical in bringing everything together. Our expertise is in the air and these guys form a crucial link with the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report by Richard Long is taken from the December 2012 edition of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/soldier-magazine/soldier-magazine.aspx" title="Soldier magazine"&gt;Soldier&lt;/a&gt; - the magazine of the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Establishing stability in Afghanistan</title>
    <summary>How the UK is helping Afghanistan to become a more secure nation with international support. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in Afghanistan for one overriding reason - to protect our national security by helping the Afghans take control of their own. We are helping Afghanistan develop the ability to maintain its own security and prevent the return of international terrorists, such as al Qaeda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, Afghanistan is supported by a range of international partners to develop its security, governance, infrastructure, economy and ability to provide essential services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan is a top UK foreign policy priority and it is our defence main effort. We are one of more than 60 countries helping the Afghan Government establish the conditions to be able to protect its citizens, provide for their basic needs and determine the country’s future, eventually without significant help from the international community. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ukinafghanistan.fco.gov.uk/en/"&gt;British Embassy in the capital Kabul&lt;/a&gt; provides a focus for the UK’s work in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="military-support"&gt;Military support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK’s military activities in Afghanistan are conducted under a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1974%282011%29"&gt;UN Mandate&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"&gt;NATO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/"&gt;International Security Assistance Force (&lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. We are the second largest contributor to this coalition of 50 nations and the majority of our armed forces in Afghanistan operate in the southern province of Helmand. &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; conducts operations alongside the Afghan National Security Forces (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;), mainly the Army (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Army"&gt;ANA&lt;/abbr&gt;) and Police (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Police"&gt;ANP&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training the Afghan Army and Police so that they are capable of independent operations and can protect the population and provide a basic civilian policing service, will be crucial to ensure Afghanistan’s long-term stability and prevent terrorists from finding a safe haven there. As well as carrying out combat operations, &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; provides training, mentoring, advice and support to the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-transfer-of-responsibility-for-security-to-afghanistan-by-2014"&gt;The transfer of responsibility for security to Afghanistan by 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shared aim of President Karzai and the members of the &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; is that the transfer of responsibility for security to the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; is completed across the whole country by the end of 2014, when the &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; mission is due to end.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature and size of the UK’s presence in Afghanistan is changing. President Karzai and &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; members have agreed to this process of change - known as ‘Transition’ - whereby full responsibility for security and governance is taken on by the Afghans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transition has already started in large areas of Afghanistan, including Helmand Province. Over three-quarters of Afghanistan’s population now live in these areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;, established in 2002, is made up of the Afghan National Army (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Army"&gt;ANA&lt;/abbr&gt;), the Afghan Air Force (AAF) and the Afghan National Police (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Police"&gt;ANP&lt;/abbr&gt;). These groups are mentored and trained by &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; forces and other specialists from the international community, for example British Police Officers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; are growing in size and capability. By 2013 we expect them to be approximately 352,000 strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; now leads 80% of conventional operations and carries out 90% of its training. As its capability grows it is increasingly taking responsibility for more specialist tasks such as dealing with Improvised Explosive Devices (roadside bombs) and route clearance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 &lt;abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"&gt;NATO&lt;/abbr&gt; will start a new, and smaller, non-combat mission in Afghanistan based on training, assisting and advising the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;. This will take place alongside international community activities that will continue to support Afghanistan’s development in other areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK support for Afghanistan’s long-term development beyond 2014 was confirmed in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-enduring-strategic-partnership-document-between-the-uk-and-afghanistan"&gt;Enduring Strategic Partnership&lt;/a&gt; agreement signed by the Prime Minister and President Karzai of Afghanistan in January 2012. It reaffirmed both countries’ commitment to a continuing partnership and friendship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreements made at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_87595.htm"&gt;Chicago Summit&lt;/a&gt; in May 2012 the UK will contribute £70 million per year from 2015 to 2017 for the development of the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Army"&gt;ANA&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Police"&gt;ANP&lt;/abbr&gt;. Our Armed Forces will be involved in supporting the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Army"&gt;ANA&lt;/abbr&gt; through a new Afghan National Army Officer Academy in Kabul. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="economic-and-social-projects"&gt;Economic and social projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are helping Afghanistan to become a more viable state that can increasingly meet its population’s needs from its own resources. This work includes support for &lt;a rel="external" href="http://projects.dfid.gov.uk/project.aspx?Project=201023"&gt;economic and social development&lt;/a&gt; and helping the Afghan Government implement its &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/afghanistan-ministry-of-counter-narcotics-national-drug-control-strategy"&gt;National Drug Control Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK agreed to maintain our development assistance of £178 million a year until 2017 at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/News/Latest-news/2012/Tokyo-Conference-on-Afghanistan-8-July-2012/"&gt;Tokyo Conference&lt;/a&gt; in July 2012. This support will help the Afghan Government to reduce extreme poverty, create jobs and achieve long-term economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s development assistance is led by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Where-we-work/Asia-South/Afghanistan/"&gt;Department for International Development&lt;/a&gt;. It concentrates on 3 main areas to increase stability and reduce poverty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving security and political stability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stimulating the economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping the Afghan Government deliver basic services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.stabilisationunit.gov.uk/"&gt;Stabilisation Unit&lt;/a&gt; is working with the Afghan Government and its people in these 3 main areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s development into a more viable state is a long-term task that will continue to face many challenges. Our efforts are not designed to create a perfect Afghanistan but one that is able to maintain its own security and prevent the return of international terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-provincial-reconstruction-team"&gt;The Provincial Reconstruction Team&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.helmandprt.com/"&gt;Provincial Reconstruction Team (&lt;abbr title="Provincial Reconstruction Team"&gt;PRT&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; is a UK-led, multinational effort of the UK, US and Danish governments. It works with &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Regional Command South West, helping the Afghan Government establish improved governance and development across Helmand Province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As agreed by President Karzai and the international community, all &lt;abbr title="Provincial Reconstruction Teams"&gt;PRTs&lt;/abbr&gt; across Afghanistan will close by the end of 2014, in keeping with developing Afghan sovereignty and transition.  This includes Helmand.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the remainder of its presence in Helmand, the &lt;abbr title="Provincial Reconstruction Team"&gt;PRT&lt;/abbr&gt; will focus on supporting the Government of Afghanistan reach inclusive political settlements backed by good governance, strong rule of law and sustainable development in line with the Government of Afghanistan’s national ministry strategies, standards and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK is in Afghanistan because the country had become a base for terrorists that threatened our country and the rest of the world. The Taliban government gave al Qaeda safe haven in Afghanistan and this allowed terrorists to plan and carry out attacks around the world, most notably the 9/11 atrocities in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban were given the opportunity to help bring the leaders of al Qaeda to account. When they refused to do so, action was taken by members of the international community to remove them from control of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The al Qaeda training camps and Taliban regime that provided them safe haven were dismantled in the months after 9/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="political-settlement"&gt;Political settlement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stability of Afghanistan will not be achieved by security activities alone and we are supporting Afghan efforts to achieve a political settlement that will secure peace and stability. The Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and others are actively involved in trilateral talks with their Afghan and Pakistani counterparts. Everyone is committed to this and we have all called on the Taliban to break from al Qaeda and participate in a peace process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK to contribute funds to Courts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia</title>
    <summary>The Foreign Secretary William Hague has announced UK funding for Courts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia to strengthen international justice.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague has updated parliament on UK contributions to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone in a written ministerial statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can announce that in order to strengthen international justice and help secure accountability for some of the most horrific crimes against humanity in the last 50 years, the UK will make a voluntary contribution of £1,000,000 to the Special Court for Sierra Leone and a voluntary contribution of £600,000 to the international component of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s contribution will help ensure the Special Court for Sierra Leone is able to complete its work, and leave a lasting legacy for the people of Sierra Leone. On 30 May, the Court sentenced Charles Taylor, a former President of Liberia, to 50 years in jail for aiding and abetting war crimes. Taylor is the first former Head of State to be convicted by an international tribunal and the Court is currently hearing his appeal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia is delivering long awaited justice for millions of Cambodians through the trials of the most senior and responsible surviving members of the Pol Pot regime. The scale of the crimes committed and the number of victims makes it one of the most significant tribunals of its kind since Nuremberg. The Government’s contribution will help to prevent the collapse of the Court which has faced a significant shortfall in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International justice is central to foreign policy. It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states, and for securing peace and reconciliation. Through the International Criminal Court, and the separate international tribunals, we are working to make clear that those responsible for the worst crimes will be held to account and that political leaders will not enjoy impunity. Our support to these institutions is an important element in our strategy to reduce conflict, promote stability and strengthen the rules based international system. In order to give Parliament a full accounting of this work we will, from this point forward, also provide an annual statement at the start of the financial year detailing our progress on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
