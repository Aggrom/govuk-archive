    <title>Small businesses to benefit from £1.1 million innovation boost</title>
    <summary>New Innovation Vouchers for businesses who want to use public open data to develop new ideas, improve processes and target new markets.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation is vital for business growth. The aim is simple – to accelerate economic growth by stimulating and supporting business-led innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £2 million fund has been created for the Innovation Vouchers scheme, running over the next three years. The vouchers provide £5000 for a UK start-up, micro, small or medium-sized businesses to work with external experts and gain new knowledge to help their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £1.1 million announced today is for companies who want to use public open data to commercialise their ideas and develop products and prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open data business innovator or inventors could use an Innovation Voucher by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow ing services and solutions using open data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing an idea into a working prototype&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrating open data with other data sources to develop products and prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeking Intellectual Property advice in respect of ideas incorporating open data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme is already open to businesses who want to develop ideas relating to the Agri-food, Built Environment, Space industries, Energy, Water and Waste sectors, with a hundred vouchers allocated every three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures from round one show that over 200 projects were successful in the draw for Innovation Vouchers for Agri-Food, Built Environment and Space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This new wave of Innovation Vouchers will give SMEs a great opportunity to bid for funding that can make a real difference to the growth of their business ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They will be able to develop exciting proposals that can make use of open data, which have the potential to unlock great value and boost economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="innovation-vouchers"&gt;Innovation Vouchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will be able to apply for the Innovation Vouchers directly through the &lt;a rel="external" href="https://vouchers.innovateuk.org/"&gt;Technology Strategy Board&lt;/a&gt; and the Open Data Institute (ODI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business can use their Innovation Vouchers to work with knowledge suppliers such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universities and further education colleges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research and technology organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical consultancies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catapult centres&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design advisers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intellectual property advisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional funding for open data vouchers comes after BIS announced this week new measures &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-funding-to-accelerate-benefits-of-open-data-684c1.aspx"&gt;to open up access to public data&lt;/a&gt;, including a new £7.5 million Data Strategy Board Breakthrough Fund and a new £850,000 open data Immersion Programme which will assist public organisations and companies in opening up new opportunities for data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Engaging the public in science and engineering</title>
    <summary>High levels of skills in science, technology, engineering and maths are essential for the UK’s prosperity</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science and research are major contributors to the prosperity of the UK. For our prosperity to continue, the government believes we need high levels of skills in science, technology, engineering and maths (&lt;abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths"&gt;STEM&lt;/abbr&gt;), and citizens that value them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To engage the public in science and engineering we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hold the British Science Festival and the National Science and Engineering Week, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/engaging-the-public-in-science-and-engineering--3/supporting-pages/raising-public-awareness-of-science-engineering-and-technology"&gt;events that promote science and raise the public’s awareness of science issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/engaging-the-public-in-science-and-engineering--3/supporting-pages/funding-national-academies"&gt;fund the work of 3 independent national academies&lt;/a&gt;: the Royal Society, the British Academy and the Royal Academy of Engineering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/engaging-the-public-in-science-and-engineering--3/supporting-pages/making-informed-science-policy-decisions"&gt;make science and engineering policy decisions that are informed by monitoring public opinion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promote science in schools and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/engaging-the-public-in-science-and-engineering--3/supporting-pages/inspiring-students-to-study-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics"&gt;fund programmes and events that inspire students to study &lt;abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths"&gt;STEM&lt;/abbr&gt; subjects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008 the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;) funded &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-vision-for-science-and-society--2"&gt;A Vision for Science and Society - A consultation on Developing a New Strategy for the UK&lt;/a&gt; to find out how we should develop science skills, improve science communication and build public confidence in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation identified five areas for us to improve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;science for all - changing public attitudes on science&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;science and the media - training the scientific community to work with the media     &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;science and learning - inspiring young people to take an interest in and study &lt;abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths"&gt;STEM&lt;/abbr&gt; subjects     &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;science and careers - improving career advice for people wanting to work in science&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;science and trust - increasing public trust in how science is done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this consultation we have drafted a set of criteria on what we should fund, which has been open to the public for comment. The next step is to develop a new set of science and society activities ready for the next financial year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The UK excels in research, development and innovation, and innovative companies are an important contributor to economic growth. We want to use our talent to make the UK the best place in the world to run an innovative business or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trying to be smarter and more strategic in how we &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-investment-in-research-development-and-innovation-for-growth/supporting-pages/using-government-purchasing-power-to-stimulate-innovation"&gt;procure goods, works and services to encourage innovation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/11-1387-innovation-and-research-strategy-for-growth.pdf"&gt;Innovation and research strategy for growth&lt;/a&gt; on 8 December 2011.
