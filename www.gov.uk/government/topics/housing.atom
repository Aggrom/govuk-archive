    <title>Million pound boost to extend homelessness help to thousands</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A cash injection of £1.2 million will help thousands of vulnerable people into the rented homes they need, Mark Prisk said today. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visiting the London Crisis Skylight Centre, the minister said the cash will extend the charity’s work through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.privaterentedsector.org.uk/prs-funding.asp"&gt;Crisis Private Rented Sector Access Development Programme&lt;/a&gt; to provide housing help for single people at risk of homelessness, who are unable to find private accommodation on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Prisk at the Crisis Skylight centre" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/6010/mark_prisk_crisis.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mark Prisk speaks to Steve Grant at Crisis Skylight to hear the problems faced by single homeless people&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="helping-vulnerable-people-into-rental-homes"&gt;Helping vulnerable people into rental homes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Private Rented Sector Access Scheme, run by Crisis with government support, has helped nearly 4,000 people find the rented homes they need in the last 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already established in 120 areas across England, the scheme offers single people the advice and support they need to find and sustain a private rented tenancy, helping them overcome hurdles like budgeting and paying a deposit and working with local landlords to ensure the homes provided are suitable, safe and secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s £1.2 million cash injection will extend the programme, creating a further 23 local schemes. By focussing on helping those most at risk of homelessness, including young people, it aims to help a further 1,300 people in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This government has a strong safety net in place to prevent homelessness and Crisis’s programme has been a vital part of this, helping nearly 4,000 vulnerable people in just two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s why today I’m providing 1.2 million to extend that support even further. With another 23 areas on board, the scheme is set to help many more single people at risk of homelessness to find and keep the long-term home they need, providing the safety and security to get their lives back on track.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leslie Morphy, chief executive of Crisis, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To have already helped 4,000 homeless people into decent homes is an incredible achievement for the Private Rented Sector Access Development Programme and the local organisations working hard to support tenants and landlords. Challenging conditions in the private rented sector make this work difficult but all the more important as people struggle to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s announcement of funding is for a further 23 schemes that will focus on helping particularly vulnerable people with no home of their own including young people and those leaving prison - groups that too often struggle to find a home and have often not been a priority for assistance through other schemes and programmes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The department has provided £10.8 million to Crisis to run the private rented sector scheme. The £1.2 million funding announced today is part of that investment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Communities to receive cash boost for choosing development</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Planning Minister Nick Boles announces new cash incentives.
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities that tackle the legacy of inadequate house-building and choose to accept new housing will benefit directly from new generous cash incentives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neighbourhoods that take a proactive approach by drawing up a neighbourhood development plan, and securing the consent of local people in a referendum, will receive 25% of the revenues from the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/community-infrastructure-levy"&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy&lt;/a&gt; arising from the development that they choose to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cash boost will be paid directly to parish and town councils and can be used to back the community’s priorities for example to re-roof a village hall, refurbish a municipal pool or take over a community pub. Neighbourhoods without a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/neighbourhood-planning"&gt;neighbourhood development plan&lt;/a&gt; but where the levy is still charged will still receive a capped 15% share of the levy revenue arising from development in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities without a parish or town council will still benefit from this incentive, with the local planning authority retaining it and spending it in accordance with the wishes of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of hectoring people and forcing development on communities, the government believes that we need to persuade communities that development is in everyone’s interest. Incentives are key to getting the homes built that we both need for today and for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital this country increases the number of homes it builds to meet the needs of its increasing population. The failure of previous administrations to build enough homes, latterly despite the credit boom, led to a severe housing shortage that has been made worse by the rapid increase in the number of households. The number of people living alone has rocketed, and immigration has led to an influx of 1.7 million people into England in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to tackle this housing shortage and make best use of what we already have the government has invested £160 million to deal with the 250,000 homes empty for more than 6 months - 50,000 fewer then in 2009. This money combined with a share of £300 million announced in September’s housing growth package, will help put more than 15,000 empty homes back into use by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has also made clear that planning should encourage the effective use of land, including brownfield land that is not of high environmental value. The majority of all new homes - 76% of those completed in 2010 - were built on brownfield land. But this will not be enough and some undeveloped land will need to be made available for house-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Boles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a simple choice.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can decide to ignore the misery of young families forced to grow up in tiny flats with no outside space. We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally and build beautiful places like we used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This government is determined to persuade communities to accept more house-building by giving them a tangible share of the benefits it brings. By undertaking a neighbourhood plan that makes space for new development, communities can secure revenues to make the community more attractive for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neighbourhood planning is an important way to make sure that development has the backing of the community. It is right that the areas that have organised themselves to bring forward a neighbourhood plan and have taken the plan through all the stages of the neighbourhood planning (including a successful examination and referendum) should be rewarded for their positive, pro-active approach to delivering growth. This is why they are entitled to an extra 10% of the levy arising from development in their area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Community Infrastructure Levy amount passed to neighbourhoods reflects the rates the local planning authority set for the levy. These charge a rate or different rates for development in the local area in pounds per square metre. The neighbourhood funding element will be calculated based on the levy receipts from the relevant development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The levy’s charges will become due from the date that a chargeable development is commenced. The neighbourhood funding element will be passed to parish or community councils in accordance with a timetable agreed between the local planning authority and the local council.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where the money is transferred to a parish council (in England) or a community council (in Wales) they will decide how the money will be spent - although they will be expected to work with the local planning authority. Where the money stays with the local planning authority (in areas without a parish or community council) the local planning authority will engage with the communities where the development has happened to agree how best to spend this money.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In areas that have not been subject to neighbourhood planning there will be a cap of £100 per council tax dwelling on the neighbourhood funds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We aim to have these incentives in place from Spring 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We previously &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/community-infrastructure-levy"&gt;consulted&lt;/a&gt; on allowing councils the choice whether to spend their levy receipts on affordable housing but given other ongoing policies to support housing, we are not proposing to make this change at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also going to enable a mayoral development corporation to impose a Community Infrastructure Levy charge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Housing the next generation</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>Speech by Planning Minister Nick Boles at an event hosted by Policy Exchange.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This version of the speech excludes party political content].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last September, the Prime Minister declared that our mission is “to build an ‘aspiration nation’”, in which we “get behind people who want to get on in life.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s what’s always made our hearts beat faster,” he said. “It’s not just an economic mission” - but “a moral one” too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to that speech as one of David Cameron’s newest and most junior ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, though I find the Prime Minister’s message inspiring, implicit in it was a challenge that keeps me awake at night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No aspiration is more deeply embedded in the British psyche than the desire to own your own home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the prospect of doing so has been slipping ever further out of the reach of millions of hard-working people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a result of our decades-long failure to build enough houses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the root cause of that is our decades-long refusal to release enough land for development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other problems affecting the housing market in the short term: most of all, the lack of finance for buyers and developers since the credit crunch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These the government is already tackling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-people-to-buy-a-home/supporting-pages/help-for-first-time-buyers"&gt;FirstBuy&lt;/a&gt;, which helps reduce the deposit first-time buyers need to find to just 5% of the price of their new home, will invest £460 million, matched by housebuilders, to help 27,000 people by 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/newbuy-guarantee-scheme"&gt;NewBuy&lt;/a&gt; enables other households to access 95% mortgages for new build homes, and the Prime Minister announced on Monday that we will bring forward further measures to increase the availability of affordable mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my colleague, Mark Prisk, is deploying £570 million in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/get-britain-building"&gt;Get Britain Building fund&lt;/a&gt; to get building going on sites that already have planning permission, and using the £225 million fund that the Deputy Prime Minister announced to accelerate the delivery of housing on large sites like Cranbrook in Devon and Ebbsfleet in Kent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in the long term, the original source of our housing crisis is the failure of past governments to provide enough land for development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As planning minister, it is my job to persuade local authorities to make more land available so that more homes can be built and the price of new homes comes down - and thereby reverse the trend that has been heading in the wrong direction for decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now can you understand why I sleep a little uneasily?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2011 census revealed that, in the ‘noughties’, home ownership in England fell, for the first time in 60 years: from 68% to 63%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because houses became too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homelessness charity, Shelter, has shown that if the price of food had risen as fast as the price of housing in the last 30 years, a supermarket chicken would now cost £47 - and a jar of instant coffee would cost £20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, the average person setting aside 5% of their income each week could save up for a deposit on a house after 8 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it would take the same person 47 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say that this trend is inevitable, given a growing population, rising incomes and a finite supply of land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Germany real house prices have remained constant since 2000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the Netherlands, which has shared the UK’s rapid growth in population, real house prices rose by a little bit more than a fifth in the same decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did they nearly double in the UK? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve built too few houses to keep up with the rapid increase in the number of households needing a place to live, especially the dizzying increase in the number of people living on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for this growth in the number of households. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some we should celebrate - like the fact that people are living longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others we should regret - like the high rate of divorce or the immigration policies that led to a net influx of 1.7 million people into England in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of these changes have happened and all of the people concerned have the right to a decent home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Shelter estimated that we would need to build 240,000 new homes a year in England to cater for all of these new households. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2012, Alan Holmans from the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research updated these estimates using my department’s publication of new projections of the number of households. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He concluded, that, to keep pace with this trend, we now need to build 270,000 new homes a year, leading to a net increase of 250,000 a year as 20,000 of them would replace existing homes that have to be demolished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether Mr Holman’s projections will prove accurate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do know that the house-building that took place during the ‘noughties’ fell woefully short of what was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a decade of easy credit and an explicit target to build 213,000 new homes a year in England, an annual average of only 147,000 new homes were completed between 2000 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same period the population went up by 3.4 million and, from 1998 to 2008, the number of households went up by 1.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, in each year of the ‘noughties’, the Netherlands built over 4.4 new homes for every 1,000 inhabitants and the French built over 5.6 for every 1,000 inhabitants. In England, we built just 2.9. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in spite the fact that, between 2000 and 2010, total mortgage debt in the UK more than doubled - from £500 billion to £1.2 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because this debt just fuelled a massive boom in prices - and did little to boost the supply of new homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those homes that were built got smaller and smaller, as land prices went up and up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2003 the new houses we built in England were smaller than the ones we’ve already got - and 30% smaller than the new houses being built in the Netherlands, a country that is more densely populated than ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For housing, as in so many areas of our national life, the ‘noughties’ were a wasted decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loads of money sloshing around, lots of top-down targets, but very little to show for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have to build even more houses to make up the ground lost and to keep pace with future growth in the number of households needing homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s assuming we continue to tighten our grip on immigration so that net migration falls below 100,000 a year by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I do really understand why the idea of a lot more house-building makes people nervous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I certainly don’t want to see more open land developed than is absolutely necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately there is no painless way to make homes affordable for working people earning ordinary wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about all the empty homes?” people ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they are certainly right to suggest that we should make full use of our &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/empty-homes"&gt;existing housing stock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most empty homes are only empty for short periods while they change hands or are renovated or are caught up in probate after the last owner’s death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are around 259,000 houses that have been empty for more than 6 months, 50,000 fewer than in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has already invested £160 million and that, together with a share of the £300 million additional spending announced in September’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-to-boost-british-housebuilding-jobs-and-the-economy"&gt;Housing Growth Package&lt;/a&gt;, should help put over 15,000 empty properties back into use by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to see good homes standing empty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they can’t make more than a marginal contribution to the hundreds of thousands of new homes that we need every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about all the brownfield land?” people then ask - and they point to the Campaign to Protect Rural England (&lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt;) estimate that England has enough brownfield land to support 1.5 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all want to maximise the number of homes we build on previously developed land - not least because such land tends to benefit from existing links to our road and rail networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even the &lt;abbr title="Campaign to Protect Rural England"&gt;CPRE&lt;/abbr&gt; admitted that we would only get 450,000 new homes out of brownfield sites in those parts of the country where most of the new homes are needed - London, the South East and the South West. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And achieving that number would require us to build on every scrap of brownfield land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that we are already building most new homes on brownfield land: 76% of all the homes completed in 2010 as against 56% in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simply can’t squeeze much more out of brownfield sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To restrict new house-building to brownfield land would leave us a long way short of the number of new homes we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So “what about the developers’ land banks?” people then ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, I do understand why it riles people that their local councils have to find new sites for development, when the major house-builders are sitting on land with permission to build hundreds of thousands of new homes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m afraid this concern is also misplaced, resting on a misunderstanding about how the British house-building industry works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of September 2012, on sites of 10 or more units, there were 487,000 units with detailed planning permission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 246,000 of them were on sites where no building has even started - and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/growthandinfrastructure.html"&gt;Growth and Infrastructure Bill&lt;/a&gt; that I am taking through Parliament with colleagues will make it easier for developers to renegotiate the unaffordable Section 106 agreements that have made many of these schemes unviable and caused them to stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most sites with planning permission are for schemes of 150 units or more which developers generally build out over 3 to 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are going to have any prospect of getting our current house-builders to build the number of new homes we need, we need them to have a pipeline of sites representing 3 to 5 years’ supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s over a million units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with developers’ land banks is not that they exist - but that they are currently much too small to feed the level of house-building that we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am afraid that we have a simple choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can decide to ignore the misery of young families forced to grow up in tiny flats with no outside space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can turn a blind eye while the dream of a property-owning democracy shrivels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th Century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t believe that anyone really wants to go down that road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we believe in anything, we believe in the power of home ownership to motivate people to work hard, raise strong families and build healthy communities, to put down roots, take responsibility for their surroundings and look out for their neighbours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As David Cameron said, “We get behind people who want to get on in life, the young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to resolve that we will make these decisions locally, and that we will build beautiful places like we used to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way England can remain the green and pleasant land we all love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start from a good position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, contrary to media myth, we’ve got plenty of undistinguished, undeveloped land to spare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By overlaying satellite imagery onto Ordnance Survey maps, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology’s 2007 Land Cover Map shows that 8.9% of England is built up or developed as gardens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that over 90% is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty together account for around 30% - more than 3 times the amount that is built on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we include the green belts that stop our cities sprawling without limit then that goes up to around 40% of England is protected from development - more than 4 times the area that is built on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are ancient woodlands and other irreplaceable habitats which are protected by the National Planning Policy Framework, and other important sites which lie outside the official designations, that are rightly championed by organisations like the &lt;abbr title="Royal Society for the Protection of Birds"&gt;RSPB&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Woodland Trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is high quality agricultural land which all of us want to see used for the essential purpose of growing food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are much loved open spaces in villages and towns, which local people understandably want to keep intact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing that I have said and nothing that this government has done will undermine the protection of National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or stop good agricultural land being used for farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or prevent councils from identifying ancient woodland and green spaces that local people want them to protect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And nothing that I have said and nothing that this government has done involves telling communities how many new houses they should accept or where they should be built. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional top-down housing targets caused enormous resentment and as we have seen failed to deliver the goods - house-building has fallen to its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have already revoked the regional strategy for the East of England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, having considered the responses to the consultation on the environmental report, I can announce today that I have decided to revoke the equivalent edict for Yorkshire and the Humber while saving the policies to protect York’s green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be making decisions about the other regional strategies in due course, once the consultations on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/strategic-environmental-assessments"&gt;other environmental reports&lt;/a&gt; have closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the localism that Eric Pickles has unleashed is not and never has been a one-way street. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he has always said, with power comes responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively/supporting-pages/national-planning-policy-framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt; spells it out very clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they draw up their local plans, councils must assess their local housing need in an objective way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they must identify immediately developable sites sufficient to supply all of the new homes that are needed over the next 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, many councils are embracing this duty with energy and imagination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some are dragging their feet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a few are looking for ways to evade their responsibilities - or slough them off onto their neighbours because the politics of house-building is just too difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that is not acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils which do not produce credible plans to meet local housing need will find that the presumption in favour of sustainable development will trump local decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they will have to explain to local residents why their failure to produce a robust local plan exposed their communities to speculative development in places where it is not welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not defend and the government will not support those local councils who abdicate their responsibility to meet their fair share of our common housing needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to pretend that it will be easy for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councillors will have to find a way to persuade the people who elect them that substantial further house-building is in the interest of the whole community, including those who are living there now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are giving them the tools they need to go about this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that people want is input into the plans for development in their neighbourhood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not just perfunctory consultation that is acknowledged but then ignored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But real involvement and a vote on the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why we’ve created the option of a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-people-more-power-over-what-happens-in-their-neighbourhood/supporting-pages/neighbourhood-planning"&gt;neighbourhood plan&lt;/a&gt;, which is drawn up by representatives of a defined community and subject to a referendum of all their neighbours, before it can be adopted and form part of the statutory plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;300 localities are already pursuing a neighbourhood plan - from Thame in South Oxfordshire to St James’ ward in central Exeter to central Milton Keynes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailblazer is Upper Eden in Cumbria, where I was on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their neighbourhood plan will be the first to be put to the test in a local referendum in March of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing people want, aside from local input and local control, is a share in the benefits that new development can bring, whether that takes the form of a boost in the local authority’s tax revenues or an investment in new community facilities or better infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why we’ve introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes/supporting-pages/new-homes-bonus"&gt;New Homes Bonus&lt;/a&gt; that gives local councils over £8,000 over 6 years for every new Council Tax Band D home that gets built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils received £430 million in New Homes Bonus in 2012 to 2013 and are provisionally set to receive £660 million in 2013 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need incentives, as Policy Exchange has pointed out, that are even more local - so that the people who have to live with new housing developments get a direct benefit from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I am pleased to be able to announce that in areas that charge the new &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/community-infrastructure-levy"&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhoods which accept new development will get 15% of the revenues from the Levy (up to a maximum of £100 per existing household).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because I believe, and this government believes, that neighbourhood plans are the key to unlocking more house-building, those communities that draw up a neighbourhood plan and have it approved by local people in a referendum will receive 25% of these revenues with no upper limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to re-roof your village hall, build a permanent home for your community shop, refurbish the municipal swimming pool, implement a new landscape design in your local park or save your local pub, look no further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump on the bandwagon and get yourself a neighbourhood plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government believes in localism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that if you give people power, they will use it responsibly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you explain to them what their community and their country needs, they will do their bit to make sure it is provided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you give them a stake in a future in which beautifully designed homes with easy access to green space are, once again affordable for working people on ordinary wages, they will do what it takes to bring that future about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perch on the lower branches at the Department for Communities and Local Government, I look around the great wood that is the British government and I see other ministers battering away at the barriers that hold people back with gusto and grit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iain Duncan Smith reforming the benefits system to ensure that work always pays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Gove giving schools control over their own destinies while ramping up expectations of the standards that they will achieve for their students. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are an inspiration and a goad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inspiration because they are ministers who have identified a shocking injustice in the way our society works and are fearless in their determination to “spread the privilege” of a good education and a decent job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A goad because we are more than half way through this Parliament, and it’s now up to me to make sure that our reformed planning system provides enough land to build the houses that England’s next generation so desperately needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it does, I’m sure I will have no problem sleeping at nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>National taskforce to end the problem of 'beds in sheds'</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new national taskforce has been set up to tackle the issue of “beds in sheds” by taking action against criminal landlords and removing illegal immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Housing Minister Grant Shapps and Immigration Minister Damian Green held the first in a series of cross-Whitehall summits with representatives from the police, the UK Border Agency and local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetings will find ways to close down thousands of sheds and outbuildings being rented out illegally to migrants, including some with no right to be in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ‘tenants’ are being exploited by ruthless landlords who charge them extortionate rents to live in cramped conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These modern day shanty towns, often visible on websites such as Google Earth, can be plagued with rats and cockroaches - and are potential death traps with dodgy wiring and poor sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some foreign ‘tenants’ wish to return home but, after destroying their passports to avoid removal, find it difficult to do so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Mr Shapps and Mr Green discussed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encouraging councils to make greater use of legal powers across planning, fire safety, housing and environmental health&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to better measure the extent and nature of the problem, drawing on information collected by Whitehall and Town Halls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how best to ensure councils and the police share the intelligence available and enforcement activity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;closer working with organisations such as the Indian High Commission to help those wanting to return home; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;steps to prevent more “beds in sheds” from being created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a scandal that these back garden slums exist to exploit people, many of whom are prepared to return voluntarily to their home country but instead find themselves trapped into paying extortionate rents to live in these cramped conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I want to see a crackdown on these criminal landlords. So today we are launching a national taskforce, made up of the police, local councils, the UK Border Agency and HM Revenue and Customs to close down these ‘beds in sheds’, help those living there to be reunited with their families and ensure their so-called landlords feel the full force of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration Minister Damian Green said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those with no right to be in the UK must leave the country. If they volunteer to leave, we will help. If they refuse, we will enforce their removal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The UK Border Agency will do whatever is necessary, working with local authorities and the police, to clear up this problem and enforce our laws against those who are in the UK illegally and the employers who exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This work is well under way - many individuals have already been removed from the UK and further enforcement visits will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some councils have argued that they need to have a new legal power of entry into premises without notice. However, councils already have this ability provided they obtain a magistrates’ warrant - which provides a proportionate check and balance on the use of such powers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id="twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Support for social tenants to have their say on local services</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Housing Minister Mark Prisk today launched a new training programme designed to put power firmly in the hands of social tenants.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He launched the £1.2 million Tenant Training and Support Programme to give residents the skills they need to hold their landlord to account, whether on their own, by setting up a tenant panel, or by taking over the management and maintenance of their homes and neighbourhoods themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boost in funding will offer a way for residents to ensure they get the service they deserve and that landlords offer the best possible value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said this new training programme would empower residents to take the first crucial step to having the necessary know-how to use their powers and take control in their neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="empowering-tenants"&gt;Empowering tenants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tpas.org.uk/"&gt;Tenant Participation Advisory Service&lt;/a&gt;, the programme offers advice, training and support to tenants by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bringing tenants together from different neighbourhoods to discuss their experiences and inspire new tenant panels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping individual tenants to engage with their landlords on a range of issues and services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offering face-to-face training with expert advisors for around 5,000 tenants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing a tenant training programme to help them make the most of the powers they have, from accredited courses to local training systems and e-learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing this, new and existing social tenants will be equipped with the skills they need to engage and negotiate confidently with their landlords. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will also be able to sign up to Community Cashback, which enables tenants to take over the management of their neighbourhood, from overseeing maintenance and minor repairs to signing up new contractors to run cleaning services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Communities across the country want to use the powers they have to ensure their needs are reflected in the services they receive. But many simply lack the confidence to challenge the people in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is why we’ve put this new tenant training scheme in place, helping make their voices heard and giving people the skills they need to ensure the changes that matter to them are made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And by playing this enhanced role tenants can help landlords improve the efficiency of local services and their work will help inspire even more communities to take control.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Meakin, Tenant Participation Advisory Service chair said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is exactly the programme we’ve all been waiting for. I urge any tenant who wants to be involved and make a difference in their community to get in touch and take advantage of the free support and training on offer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="examples-of-effective-tenant-involvement"&gt;Examples of effective tenant involvement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helena Partnerships&lt;/em&gt; has set up the tenant-led customer excellence panel to challenge their landlord on performance and service delivery. It sets its own review programme, commissions mystery shoppers and has unfettered access to Helena’s performance and complaints information, customer surveys, activity-based costing and customer insight data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel carries out tenant-led peer reviews and hosts a series of webinars to engage with other organisations involved in scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works closely with Helena’s young inspectors - a group of under 25’s who play an active role in testing and challenging services while gaining transferable skills for employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel’s work has been responsible for a number of practical changes to Helena services to reflect the needs of tenants and delivered value for money savings, including tailored rent statements, extended repairs appointment times and changes to the complaints service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tower Hamlets, &lt;em&gt;Poplar HARCA&lt;/em&gt; (8,500 homes) is committed to helping social tenants to play a key role in their local housing. Recognising the benefits of tenant empowerment, the association enables democratically elected residents to monitor services on each of the association’s 12 estates, where they have delegated budgets enabling them to make community improvements. Additionally, tenant board members scrutinise the association’s policies and initiatives, challenging senior managers and making recommendations for improvements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents can also use their local knowledge to try to resolve complaints about the association’s services. A youth empowerment board has been set up, comprising 30 young people drawn from across the estates, to ensure that the views of young people are heard. In total, over 300 residents are directly involved in decision making, performance monitoring and complaints handling at the association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tenant empowerment programme is designed to inspire tenants to lead change in their communities by having the skills and confidence to scrutinise, influence and control local services through tenant panels and other scrutiny mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant funding of almost £1.2 million will be made to the Tenant Participation Advisory Service to deliver a training and support programme. For further information on the programme visit their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tpas.org.uk/tenantcentral"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make it your New Year’s resolution to help get rough sleepers off the streets</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>People setting their New Year’s resolutions can now pledge to offer practical help to rough sleepers in 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk urged anyone wanting to get help for someone sleeping rough to use the new StreetLink hotline and website to ensure they are put in touch with the local agencies offering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He argued that while people want to offer help to those facing homelessness, they often don’t know where to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But StreetLink, run by charities Homeless Link and Broadway with support from the government, offers a “valuable alternative” to a cash handout for people sleeping rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-second-night-out"&gt;No Second Night Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those looking to offer help can call 0300 500 0914 or go to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk" title="StreetLink"&gt;www.streetlink.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; to put those facing sleeping rough in touch with local charities and councils who can them get them long-term support and safe accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister argued this new and innovative service helps support the No Second Night Out initiative as it is extended across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In London, where No Second Night Out has been adopted, 70% of rough sleepers have not spent more than one night on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The New Year offers many of us an opportunity to make a new start - StreetLink offers that opportunity to those facing the prospect of living on our streets and a valuable alternative to simply a cash handout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would urge anyone looking to set themselves a New Year’s resolution to use this service to ensure people sleeping rough in their area get the support they need to get off the streets and into a stable home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZBIXCl1UwE"&gt;Mark Prisk on rough sleeping and Streetlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Improving the rented housing sector</title>
    <category>Policy</category>
    <summary>We're improving the quality and quantity of social homes for rent and encouraging investment in the private rented sector. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 1.8 million households on waiting lists for social housing. We must ensure people can get accommodation that meets their needs both in terms of quality and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is improving the quality and quantity of properties for rent, both in the private and social sector. We are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector--2/supporting-pages/social-housing-reform"&gt;allowing local flexibility&lt;/a&gt; on waiting lists, the types of tenancies and social tenants’ and landlords’ rights and responsibilities &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping social landlords stop &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector--2/supporting-pages/social-housing-fraud" title="Social housing fraud"&gt;tenancy fraud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector--2/supporting-pages/anti-social-behaviour-in-housing"&gt;anti-social behaviour&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing more affordable housing, including through a new model of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector--2/supporting-pages/providing-affordable-homes-for-rent"&gt;affordable rent&lt;/a&gt; that allows registered housing providers to charge no more than 80% of local market rent&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 21 November 2011, the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government published &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/laying-the-foundations-a-housing-strategy-for-england--2" title="Laying the foundations: a housing strategy for England"&gt;Laying the foundations: a housing strategy for England,&lt;/a&gt; which set out the government’s actions to address the housing shortage, boost the economy, create jobs, and give people the opportunity to get on the housing ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published a consultation on reforming social housing &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-fairer-future-for-social-housing" title="A fairer future for social housing"&gt;Local decisions: a fairer future for social housing&lt;/a&gt; on 22 November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New guidance for allocating social housing, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/allocation-of-accommodation-guidance-for-local-housing-authorities-in-england" title="Allocation of accommodation: guidance for local housing authorities in England"&gt;Allocation of accommodation: guidance for local housing authorities in England&lt;/a&gt; was published on 5 January 2012 to accompany changes in the Localism Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 June 2011 we published an &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affordable-rent-impact-assessment--2" title="affordable rent impact assessment"&gt;affordable rent impact assessment&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affordable-rent-full-equality-impact-assessment--2" title="Affordable rent: full equality impact assessment"&gt;full equality impact assessment.&lt;/a&gt; This shows the costs and benefits of providing affordable housing under the new model as part of the Affordable Homes Programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/" title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;Homes and Communities Agency&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) is the national housing and regeneration agency for England (other than in London). It was established as an non-departmental government body on 1 December 2008. &lt;abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency"&gt;HCA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s role includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with partners to  create homes, economic growth and jobs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing investment, including the Affordable Homes Programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;economic regulation of housing associations, safeguarding £43 billion of taxpayer investment in the sector and helping to secure more private investment for affordable housing&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Mark Prisk: £200 million Build to Rent fund will boost housebuilding</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A new £200 million fund will boost the construction of new homes specifically for private rent, Housing Minister Mark Prisk said today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Build to Rent fund aims to cut the risk for developers more traditionally used to building homes for sale who are looking to branch out into building homes for private rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By financing the construction of rental homes until they are built, let out and managed, the fund will give developers the freedom to build homes specifically for that market with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management companies will have the chance to invest in these new rental developments, and developers will then repay the investment from government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching the new fund, the Housing Minister described it as yet another step to support housebuilding which will help boost the economy, create jobs and strengthen the housing market by providing people with a broader housing choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="reviving-the-rental-market"&gt;Reviving the rental market&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Prisk said that Build to Rent follows recommendations contained in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-rented-homes-review-of-the-barriers-to-institutional-investment" title="Private rented homes: review of the barriers to institutional investment"&gt;Montague report&lt;/a&gt; into rented homes earlier this year and will help address the varying level of quality across the nation’s private rented sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of private rental landlords are small-scale, individual investors. This fund will redress the balance, by stimulating the market in private rented homes for large-scale housing organisations that will in turn help set a new benchmark for landlords across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kickstart this new, larger scale market for privately rented homes, the minister said that Build to Rent will fund ‘demonstration’ projects to show how it might work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert taskforce will also work to boost investor awareness of the fund and offer practical support to those interested in this new market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A healthy rental housing market must have a broad range of choice across the board. But for it to grow and develop, we must first attract new investors. The Build to Rent fund will support this, helping to build homes specifically for private rent and breathing new life into the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And by driving this market in housebuilding, the fund will also help create new jobs, build the homes that families need and local people want, and support economic growth across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayor of London Boris Johnson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The private rented sector now houses a quarter of Londoners and has the potential to support the delivery of a huge number of new homes in the future. I welcome this funding and I will continue to make the case that investment in London’s housing infrastructure is one of the best ways to deliver much needed construction jobs and economic growth now, while at the same time laying the foundations for our economic growth for years to come.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greater London Authority will lead on assessing the expressions of interest for sites in London. Shortlisting decisions will be made by DCLG, the Homes and Communities Agency and the Greater London Authority. The Homes and Communities Agency will undertake due diligence, contracting and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The £200 million Build to Rent Fund is now open for bids, and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/private-rented-sector" title="Build to Rent Fund prospectus"&gt;prospectus&lt;/a&gt; has been published on the HCA website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fund has been developed to support purpose built, private rented demonstration schemes across England which have the potential to attract investors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <summary>Over the next 20 years, more than 20,000 new homes will be built at Ebbsfleet, Kent, with builders on site as early as summer 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 29 August, the Department for Communities and Local Government announced a support package to unlock 22,600 new homes at Ebbsfleet, Kent over the next 20 years. Developers, Land Securities, have invested over £100 million in developing the site. However, plans have been delayed amid concerns over the cost and the need for further investment in transport improvements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kent County Council and Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils worked closely with the department, and with Department for Transport and the Highways Agency to reduce costs of the transport programme and to agree how funding could be unlocked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, builders could be on site as early as summer 2013 with the first homes set to be completed by December 2013. The first phase of 1,500 homes at Eastern Quarry is expected to be completed by 2020, with a further 3,000 homes ready by 2030 to 2031. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern Quarry forms part of longer term plans which are expected to unlock the development of 22,600 homes and around 1 million metres squared of commercial development across the Kent Thameside region over the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cranbrook</title>
    <category>Case study</category>
    <summary>The new Cranbrook community in East Devon, has the capacity to deliver 6,000 new homes between 2012 to 2026.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Cranbrook community in East Devon, has the capacity to deliver some 6,000 new homes over the period 2012 to 2026. Almost a third of all housing required in the wider Exeter area is directly dependent on the successful delivery of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 of the development is already underway, funded by a £12 million repayable grant from a revolving infrastructure fund managed by the Homes and Communities Agency and being repaid on a roof tax basis. Using this funding the developer (the Cranbrook New Community Consortium) can build 1,120 homes by 2015, along with building the main access route into Cranbrook, the Clyst Honiton Bypass and a primary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investment"&gt;Investment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government investment of £20 million will provide: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£10 million for a new secondary school&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£4 million for a second primary school&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£6 million for infrastructure and services to create a new high street for the town centre and commercial areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment will ensure continuity of the scheme, securing the delivery of phase 2, while putting in place the capacity for up to 6,000 homes on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government’s investment, subject to due diligence, will directly unlock phase 2 and provide the infrastructure and school facilities that will give local partners the confidence to build an additional 2,380 homes by 2019.  It will also enable the developer to put in place enough infrastructure to support 6,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the housing, government investment will help create the confidence to bring forward the new town centre and support the realisation of the full ambition for the scheme. It will also provide employment (1,500 jobs) and retail space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
