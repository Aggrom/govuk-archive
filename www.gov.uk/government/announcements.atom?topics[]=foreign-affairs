    <title>This week at the Foreign Office </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h4 id="syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary outlined the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-remarks-at-the-friends-of-syria-meeting" title="Foreign Secretary remarks at Friends of the Syrian People meeting"&gt;immediate priorities for the Friends of the Syrian People&lt;/a&gt; at the meeting in Marrakesh this week. He said “Syria needs a political transition leading to an inclusive new government, with full executive authority. This is the course most likely to achieve stability in the country.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="international-human-rights-day"&gt;International Human Rights Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On International Human Rights Day Baroness Warsi launched the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-baroness-warsi-marks-human-rights-day" title="Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi marks Human Rights Day"&gt;UK’s campaign for election to the Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;. She said: “We believe in a Human Rights Council that can make its voice heard, even when the issues are unpopular or difficult to hear.” The Foreign Office marked &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/" title="16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence"&gt;16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&lt;/a&gt; ending on Monday with a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/post/37632415718/helen-pankhurst" title="guest post"&gt;guest post from Dr. Helen Pankhurst&lt;/a&gt; from CARE international. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="foreign-office-website-moves-to-govuk"&gt;Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-website-moves-to-gov-uk" title="Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK"&gt;Foreign Office began publishing its news&lt;/a&gt;, speeches, policy, publications and corporate information on GOV.UK – the single home for all government services and information. Our travel advice and consular information, and our Embassy and High Commission websites will follow by March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea-dprk"&gt;Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-condemns-dprk-s-satellite-launch" title="Foreign Secretary condemns DPRK’s satellite launch"&gt;condemned the DPRK’s satellite launch&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday saying that the launch was a clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 because it involved the testing of ballistic missile technology. The Permanent Under Secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/north-korean-ambassador-summoned-to-foreign-and-commonwealth-office" title="DPRK Ambassador summoned"&gt;summoned the DPRK’s Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in London to the Foreign Office to make clear to the UK’s condemnation of the DPRK’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="parental-child-abduction"&gt;Parental Child Abduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New figures revealed that the number of parental child abduction cases dealt with by the Foreign Office has risen by 88% in under a decade. The child abduction section at the Foreign office launched a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/parental-child-abduction-is-a-worldwide-problem" title="Parental Child Abduction"&gt;campaign to increase understanding of the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-met-the-king-of-jordan" title="The Foreign Secretary met the King of Jordan"&gt;the Foreign Secretary met His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan&lt;/a&gt; they discussed the situation in Syria, the Middle East Peace Process and institute reforms in Jordan that would bring about greater political participation, transparency and economic opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that the Iranian investigation into the death of the blogger Sattar Beheshti whilst in custody had &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/iranian-investigation-into-detained-blogger-is-missed-opportunity-for-justice" title="Iranian investigation is missed opportunity for justice"&gt;failed to deliver justice&lt;/a&gt;. The Minister said: “The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="also-this-week"&gt;Also this week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington set out the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-europe-renews-uk-commitment-to-eu-enlargement" title="UK’s commitment to EU enlargement"&gt;UK’s commitment to EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt visited Libya to strengthen &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fco-minister-shows-continued-uk-support-to-libyan-people-on-trip-to-region" title="Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt visit to Libya"&gt;UK relations with the new Libyan government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minister for Africa Marks Simmonds &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-africa-hails-ghana-as-a-beacon-of-democracy-following-successful-elections" title="Ghana election"&gt;hailed Ghana as a ‘beacon of democracy’&lt;/a&gt; following successful elections.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>UK welcomes new counter terrorism centre in UAE</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harnessing the broad experience and expertise of the 30 Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF) founding member nations, the Centre will lead global research on the drivers of terrorism, deliver training to address these, and identify practical, operational initiatives to reduce the threat from terrorism. It was launched at the third ministerial meeting of the GCTF in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which was attended by representatives from all member nations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from Tunisia, where he is on an official visit, Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s launch in Abu Dhabi of the Centre of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) is an important milestone in the global fight against terrorism. In particular I welcome the leadership that His Excellency Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed has shown and the Emirati commitment to host the Centre and make it a reality. The UK will continue to give it our full support. We have nominated an expert to serve as a Member of the International Steering Board and are seconding a Director of Training &amp;amp; Capacity-Building into the Centre’s senior management team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are determined to do our utmost to tackle the root causes of terrorism by ensuring a collaborative international approach to the common threat of terrorism. The Global Counter Terrorism Forum offers us an excellent platform from which to address this constantly changing challenge, drawing on the expertise and experience of its members”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/liam-fox-nato-support-crucial-to-building-afghan-forces"/>
    <title>Liam Fox: NATO support crucial to building Afghan forces</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He confirmed Afghanistan as the highest foreign policy priority of the new British Coalition Government, and the top priority for the Ministry of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the last day of his first NATO meeting in Brussels, Dr Fox said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The British Government supports both the mission and the counter-insurgency strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I encourage allies to demonstrate strategic patience and give time for the counter-insurgency strategy to work, but stress the need to be able to show significant progress, consolidating ISAF’s hold in central Helmand, and accelerating the training of the Afghan security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to step up our approach to communicating the vital importance of the mission in Afghanistan. We need to produce a stronger narrative alongside the political leadership we are providing to ensure that our troops get the support they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox emphasised that the NATO Training Mission is key to ISAF’s strategy for transition, to ensure the Afghans can take the lead in securing their own country in future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General McChrystal told this meeting that the Afghan National Security Forces [ANSF] are making quick progress in terms of training, but we still have some way to go in terms of improving the Afghan National Police and getting the numbers and quality of training up to the level we require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise the vital role of the training mission. We will assess whether we can contribute more and urge others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me be direct: we are aware of the difficulties that some countries face in sending combat troops - politically and even constitutionally. However, there is no excuse for any country here not to send trainers to the Afghan mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we fail in the NATO Training Mission it will signify a lack of political will and a failure of moral resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to ensure we can build up that critical mass of the ANSF, so that when we do leave Afghanistan, we leave behind a secure country, and not a security vacuum. There is a moral duty on every member of NATO to contribute to that training mission, and that’s the message I give to our NATO partners today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr Liam Fox (right) meets NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in Brussels" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5594/Liam_Fox-_NATO_support_crucial_to_building_Afghan_forces_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Liam Fox (right) meets NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in Brussels [Picture: NATO, 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox welcomed progress that is beginning to be made on planning for transition, in advance of the Kabul Conference in July:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important to ensure that both ISAF contributors and the Government of Afghanistan are involved in developing the plan for transition and that the process should be transparent, allowing ISAF partners to communicate progress towards transition to domestic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Security criteria should be the most important in assessing readiness for transition. Though some level of governance and development is essential for delivering security, we must not set the bar too high. Governance and development efforts will continue through and beyond transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox also reaffirmed that NATO remains the most important strategic relationship for the United Kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NATO is the core of the security and defence of all its members, on both sides of the Atlantic. It is the UK’s instrument of first resort for collective security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why NATO remains so important and so successful is its ability to change as risks and threats evolve. Afghanistan is one example of a task that would have been inconceivable a decade ago. Then the alliance was being told to go out of area or out of business. Today, it is very much in business but facing even greater challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox emphasised that NATO has primacy in terms of Europe’s security and the starting point should be that the EU only acts militarily when NATO cannot or chooses not to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I recognise, of course, that there will be occasions when it is appropriate for the EU to intervene but the EU should avoid duplicating the functions NATO already performs and the capabilities it already possesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In today’s economic climate, the last thing any Defence Minister needs to put to his or her Finance Minister or Generals is a case for militarily unnecessary duplication. NATO and the EU need the strongest possible links and what matters most is what works best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox expressed concern over the state of NATO’s finances but said that he was encouraged by the Secretary General’s report to members which made it clear that much has been done to bring these under proper control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During two days of meetings in NATO Headquarters, Defence Ministers discussed NATO reform, resources, capabilities and missile defence, and met in ISAF and KFOR formats to discuss Afghanistan and Kosovo. There were also meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Nuclear Planning Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the margins of the formal meetings, Dr Fox met the NATO Secretary General and the Defence Ministers of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Norway, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands, France, Afghanistan, Canada, Turkey, Portugal, Latvia, Australia, the United States and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Scots Guards home after handover to Afghan forces</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 50 Guardsmen from the Right Flank of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/23989.aspx" title="1st Battalion Scots Guards"&gt;1st Battalion Scots Guards&lt;/a&gt; have returned to their barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, as the checkpoints they manned have been closed and the Afghan National Civil Order Police (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Civil Order Police"&gt;ANCOP&lt;/abbr&gt;) are now taking responsibility for security in Helmand’s Upper Gereshk Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots Guards are serving with Task Force Helmand, currently led by the British Army’s &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.army.mod.uk/structure/29027.aspx" title="4th Mechanized Brigade"&gt;4th Mechanized Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, known as ‘The Black Rats’, and the Right Flank form part of the first 500 British troops to be sent home from Afghanistan as announced by the Prime Minister last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The troops were based at Checkpoints ‘Barcha’ and ‘Pan Kalay’ and Observation Post ‘Tegha’ in the Upper Gereshk Valley - the northernmost area of operations for Task Force Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardsmen have been working alongside the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Civil Order Police"&gt;ANCOP&lt;/abbr&gt; to bring security and allow freedom of movement for traffic on Route 611, the main road between Sangin and Gereshk, but that job has been successfully handed over to the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Sayed Farid, the new Afghan Commander from the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Civil Order Police"&gt;ANCOP&lt;/abbr&gt;’s 5th Brigade taking over from the Scots Guards in Pan Kalay, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe all the Afghan forces are now well-equipped, well-armed and ready to take on the security of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since we have been here we have some really good relations with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/" title="Afghanistan International Security Assistance Force"&gt;&lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forces. They have really helped us out. We are only sad because our friends are leaving. They did their part of the job and we did ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Guardsman Alan Primrose " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5529/AMOCCCT-2012-240-295g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Guardsman Alan Primrose on board an RAF C-17 Globemaster aircraft at Camp Bastion [Picture: Corporal Jamie Peters RLC, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platoon Commander Second Lieutenant James Westlake, attached to the Right Flank from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/regiments/24680.aspx" title="Honourable Artillery Company"&gt;Honourable Artillery Company&lt;/a&gt;, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was quite apparent to everyone in the platoon, not just higher up, that the job is done. The time is right to be going back and the Afghan forces in those locations are ready to take over - there is just not a job for us to do by staying there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So everybody is satisfied that it is a job well done and, once you take that into account, everybody is looking forward to getting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checkpoints and observation post are the first on the main 611 highway in Task Force Helmand’s area of operations to be closed. During the closure process, the facilities were removed and the bases reduced to a more basic level for the few troops that remained until the final day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follwing some leave, the Scots Guards will be responsible for providing support to the battle groups deploying to Afghanistan in April 2013, when the Guardsmen will be reunited with the rest of the battalion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister announced last year that 500 British personnel would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2012, reflecting the continuing progress in Helmand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawdown is consistent with the process of transition to Afghan forces agreed by &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; nations at Lisbon in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has emphasised the UK’s commitment to Afghanistan for the long term, pledging £70 million per annum in funding for the Afghan security forces, in addition to the taking the lead in setting up an Afghan National Army Officers’ Academy in Kabul after the combat mission ends in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/soldiers-offer-ground-expertise-to-aerial-assets-in-afghanistan"/>
    <title>Soldiers offer ground expertise to aerial assets in Afghanistan </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Army &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx" title="Apache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are often called upon to neutralise enemy threats, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" title="Royal Air Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; plays an equally important role with their impressive fleet of fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fearsome aerial assets fly out of Kandahar and, although the pilots and support crew are based well outside &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/" title="British Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; circles, they have direct access to all things green courtesy of skilled ground liaison officers (GLOs) who are embedded within their squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such personnel act as a link between the 2 Services to ensure those in the air have a clear understanding of the situation below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornado.cfm" title="Tornado GR4"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; Force’s War Week exercise at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/" title="RAF Marham"&gt;RAF Marham&lt;/a&gt;, Captain James Perring of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/24651.aspx" title="1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment"&gt;1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about taking everything that is happening on the ground and translating that into basic speak for the aircrew. They have no idea about the situation on the ground so we talk them through the process. I get involved with anything that is Army-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to give as much information as possible so when they are up in the sky they know where people are and what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring is now on a four-month deployment with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/9squadron.cfm" title="9 Squadron"&gt;9 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan and the serviceman was quick to highlight the differences between his roles with the RAF and Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Ground Liaison Officer"&gt;GLO&lt;/abbr&gt; is a posting I applied for and is something completely different. I had no idea or appreciation of how air assets work so it has given me great insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is going to be an interesting tour and in a way I will have a greater understanding of the bigger picture in Afghanistan compared to spending 6 months on foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5427/tornadosg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring joined the Tornado Force for the War Week exercise at RAF Marham [Picture: Graeme Main, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working with the RAF has been a bit of a culture shock. Sometimes the bureaucracy can be frustrating but it works for them and it is like that for a reason. It has been hard to adjust but there are positives to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring was not the only soldier involved in War Week. Major Jeremy Higgins of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/23445.aspx" title="Royal Artillery"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt;, a reservist who is a director for Cross Country Trains, was also on hand to offer expert advice and guidance from an Army perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise is designed to test personnel on the scenarios they are likely to face in theatre and the officer was determined to add as much realism as possible. Major Higgins said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to ensure the aircrew get the training they need ahead of the deployment, while tying in with other agencies such as forward air controllers. It is about orchestrating different elements in the air and on the ground so when the jets go out they get the training they require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will be talking to troops in the field beforehand, asking what they need and what they are trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The aircrew also highlight the areas they want to work on, such as night missions, and the soldiers come up with different scenarios for them. Effectively we have two serials feeding into one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a close link between the two forces, GLOs are mindful of not overloading their airborne colleagues with unfamiliar Army tactics and thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not just UK personnel who benefit from the support offered by the Tornado crews. Major Higgins explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Preparing a Tornado for take off" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5428/tornados3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;RAF personnel preparing a Tornado for take off at Kandahar Airfield (library image) [Picture: Corporal Andy Benson RAF, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be quite challenging as we cover the whole of Afghanistan and can be allocated anywhere. It is an international role and we have to get information from soldiers who do not have English as their first language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We give the aircrews some situational awareness and that can be quite important due to the various forces we work with. They have different kit, depending on what they are doing, so a footprint of life on the ground is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Toyota Hilux with guys in the back could be perceived as being the enemy, but it may also be local allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about adding value in any way we can. We may be asked simple questions or ones that completely floor us. We interact with land troops to get a picture of what they want from the fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for aerial assets is inevitably strong as soldiers maintain the Army’s operational tempo and such requests mean the RAF are on high alert during the training cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Lisa Foy, the acting officer in command of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/aboutus/opswg.cfm" title="RAF Marham - Operations Wing"&gt;RAF Marham’s Operations Wing&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is always more demand than we can meet but we strive to match the requirements from Land whenever possible. We want to benefit the personnel on exercise while training the Tornado crews as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise that the Force needs to train with soldiers and War Week is the perfect opportunity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A lot of 9 Squadron’s training during this phase has been provided by the Army, and GLOs are critical in bringing everything together. Our expertise is in the air and these guys form a crucial link with the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>UK to contribute funds to Courts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague has updated parliament on UK contributions to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone in a written ministerial statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can announce that in order to strengthen international justice and help secure accountability for some of the most horrific crimes against humanity in the last 50 years, the UK will make a voluntary contribution of £1,000,000 to the Special Court for Sierra Leone and a voluntary contribution of £600,000 to the international component of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s contribution will help ensure the Special Court for Sierra Leone is able to complete its work, and leave a lasting legacy for the people of Sierra Leone. On 30 May, the Court sentenced Charles Taylor, a former President of Liberia, to 50 years in jail for aiding and abetting war crimes. Taylor is the first former Head of State to be convicted by an international tribunal and the Court is currently hearing his appeal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia is delivering long awaited justice for millions of Cambodians through the trials of the most senior and responsible surviving members of the Pol Pot regime. The scale of the crimes committed and the number of victims makes it one of the most significant tribunals of its kind since Nuremberg. The Government’s contribution will help to prevent the collapse of the Court which has faced a significant shortfall in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International justice is central to foreign policy. It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states, and for securing peace and reconciliation. Through the International Criminal Court, and the separate international tribunals, we are working to make clear that those responsible for the worst crimes will be held to account and that political leaders will not enjoy impunity. Our support to these institutions is an important element in our strategy to reduce conflict, promote stability and strengthen the rules based international system. In order to give Parliament a full accounting of this work we will, from this point forward, also provide an annual statement at the start of the financial year detailing our progress on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the Millies heroes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the rest of this week we’ll be bringing you interviews with some of the winners and their celebrity presenters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="true-grit-award"&gt;True Grit Award&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wounded in a Taliban blast, hero soldier Corporal Oliver Kennedy battled through his own pain to help injured comrades. Corporal Kennedy, from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/23994.aspx" title="The Princess of   Wales's Royal Regiment"&gt;Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, suffered deep shrapnel wounds when his platoon was hit in October 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He credited his training for ‘kicking in’ and he was quickly back on his feet pulling the wounded to safety. His actions, later described as ‘exemplary’, saw two men survive their life-threatening injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir David Jason and ‘Spooks’ star Hermione Norris handed the True Grit Award to Corporal Kennedy who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;II just cracked on and carried on. I was shocked to win as my category was so strong and was lost for words but I’m so honoured to be nominated let alone win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstage at the ceremony, Hermione Norris told Corporal Kennedy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s so admirable what you do to keep us safe and often goes unnoticed. It’s a huge privilege to be here to say thank you, show respect and celebrate what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hermione added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I find it overwhelming. I know quite a few people in the Army who have young families and the sacrifice that they make, the danger that they face and the humility of humanity to keep us all safe just takes my breath away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir David Jason said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We know so little about the day-to-day work that these men and women do but it’s so important. I doubt that Mr and Mrs Average ever think about what these guys and girls do on our behalf but, without them, we’d be speaking German!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="most-outstanding-airman-award"&gt;Most Outstanding Airman Award&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Christine Bleakley, Sergeant Roy Geddes and Frank Lampard" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4692/millies4g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;From left: TV presenter Christine Bleakley, Sergeant Roy Geddes with his Outstanding Airman Award and Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard [Picture: The Sun newspaper]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Taliban death squad breached the walls of Camp Bastion, it was Sergeant Roy Geddes who led the defence. His heroic charge of the base is now dubbed the ‘Battle of Bastion’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Geddes from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafregiment/squadrons/51_sqn_history.cfm" title="51 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment"&gt;51 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment&lt;/a&gt; in Moray, led a band of men in September when 15 insurgents blew their way into the base, where Prince Harry was based at the time, killing 2 US Marines and destroying 6 US Harriers. Despite getting a painful lump of shrapnel in his knee, Sergeant Geddes fought on until the base was safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Geddes received the Most Outstanding Airman Award from TV presenter Christine Bleakley and Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second year running, Premiership and England star Frank joined the judges’ panel and had the tough task of helping to select the winners. He said that when he read the airman’s citation, he was instantly struck by his ‘quick-thinking’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Groups need leaders and Roy was certainly a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Roy is an extraordinary character, very unassuming, but when you hear the tale that he has to tell, you can’t quite believe it. He’s a very special man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out for more Millies winners over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Royal Marines help train Afghan police</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trainees spent their final week of instruction receiving expert tuition on 40 Commando’s ranges at ‘HMS Price’, the hub of the Marines’ operation in Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dozen policemen graduated from the three-week course at a ceremony at District Police Headquarters in Gereshk attended by both their Afghan Uniform Police instructors and their International Security Assistance Force mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other nations, Afghanistan has various police forces fulfilling various functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan Uniform Police, easily recognisable in Afghanistan by their gun-metal-blue uniforms, are the national law enforcement agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan Local Police, or &lt;abbr title="Afghan Local Police"&gt;ALP&lt;/abbr&gt;, wear a khaki uniform and are a local police force drawn from the immediate area - much like community support officers in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Lee Piper, the &lt;abbr title="Afghan Local Police"&gt;ALP&lt;/abbr&gt; Liaison Officer with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/The-Royal-Marines/3-Commando-Brigade/40-Commando" title="40 Commando Royal Marines"&gt;40 Commando&lt;/a&gt;, explained the role of the newly-qualified officers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Afghan police training in Helmand" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4961/Afghan_police_in_Helmand.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Afghan police training in Helmand [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These 12 Afghan Local Policemen completing training improves security because it will basically provide security for the local villagers. They have intimate knowledge of the local area for the Afghan National Police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the second graduation ceremony in the past month. Captain Kristian Hansen, the Afghan National Security Forces Development Officer with the Danish Army based at HMS Price, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It shows that training of the local police has come a long way. It’s now organised and taking place on a regular basis thus making the &lt;abbr title="Afghan Local Police"&gt;ALP&lt;/abbr&gt; a better and more coherent security force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly-graduated officers will now man checkpoints in the south of the Nahr-e Saraj district of central Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their presence in the area is key to the improving security situation in the area, allowing British forces to hand over security responsibility for the area to the Afghan National Security Forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Europe renews UK commitment to EU enlargement </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister gave a press briefing for European journalists today following his participation in the General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 11 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK remains a strong supporter of EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey. I’ve just returned from the General Affairs Council in Brussels where I was pleased to have a long discussion on EU enlargement. Its conclusions make clear the EU’s continued support for enlargement. This is important, and a message that I hope will be heard clearly in the accession and pre-accession countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is good for the EU and one of the EU’s greatest achievements. The European Union, alongside NATO, has been an instrument of peace and reconciliation that has helped spread democracy and the rule of law across our continent, and helped make armed conflict between EU members unthinkable. At the same time an enlarged Single Market, another of the key success stories of the EU, has opened up prosperity and opportunity to hundreds of millions of people. An outward-looking approach and a continuing commitment to enlargement should be seen by all EU Member States as signs of strength and vigour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is also good for wider security and prosperity across the continent. The accession of new Member States helps promote security, stability and prosperity across Europe, based on a firm foundation of democracy, human and civil rights, and respect for the law. The focus on good neighbourly relations is particularly important for a region such as the Western Balkans which saw conflict only two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a respect for this firm foundation and its benefits which drives the UK’s scrutiny of progress and focus on conditionality. So the UK is clear that there will be no pause after Croatia’s accession. But equally there will be no movement without progress on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Foreign Secretary visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo in October. He set out clearly the UK’s support for each country’s EU future. But he stressed to the political leaders that they needed to take the necessary steps to deliver. I hope political leaders in all of the aspiring countries will do so and that we will see further progress being made towards the EU early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the UK remains committed to Turkey’s EU membership. We strongly believe that this would contribute to Europe’s prosperity and security, and the EU remains the strongest lever for reform in Turkey. We are focused on making real progress on the accession process in 2013 and we fully support the Irish Presidency in their desire to open a new acquis Chapter during their Presidency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>North Korean Ambassador summoned to Foreign and Commonwealth Office </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Permanent Under Secretary, Simon Fraser, today summoned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Ambassador in London, Mr Hyon Hak Bong, to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Fraser made clear to the Ambassador the UK’s condemnation of the DPRK’s actions. He stressed that the international community was united in their assessment that this launch, using ballistic missile technology, was a breach of UN Security Council Resolution 1874 and that it threatened regional stability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He urged the DPRK to avoid further provocative action and take urgent steps to re-engage constructively with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally he pointed out that instead of expecting international aid and assistance the DPRK could have spent the money used on this launch to bring food and modernisation to its people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Apache crews receive Afghanistan and Libya campaign medals </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soldiers from the Wattisham-based 4 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC) were on parade yesterday to be presented with campaign medals recognising their role in the NATO-led Libya operation in Summer 2011 and their service in Afghanistan earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 deployments challenged the unit’s air and ground crews to carry out the Apache’s first operational missions in the salty sea air and confined spaces of a ship sailing off Libya, as well as supporting troops in the hot, high and dusty conditions of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colonel Jacko Jackson, Deputy Commander of 16 Air Assault Brigade, presented 66 soldiers who served in the Libya campaign with NATO’s Non-Article 5 Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR medals, which the Queen has granted special permission for military personnel to wear, and a further 44 Operational Service Medals for Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two operational honours awarded for actions during the Libya campaign - a Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service for Major Mike Neville and a Mention in Despatches for Warrant Officer Class 1 Jonathan Lane - were also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apaches from the regiment’s 656 Squadron flew sorties over Libya from HMS Ocean as part of NATO operations to protect civilians in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. On 22 missions between June and October 2011 the Apaches hit more than 100 targets, firing 99 Hellfire missiles and 4,800 30mm cannon rounds. Operation ELLAMY was the name of the British military’s contribution to the Libya campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Colonel Jacko Jackson presents soldiers with campaign medals" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4681/16x-2012-121-0181.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As well as pinpoint strikes in support of ground troops, the Apache’s role is to escort other helicopters and land convoys and provide a near-all-weather surveillance capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Jason Etherington, Commanding Officer of 4 Regiment AAC, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a very proud day as we join with our families to celebrate our achievements over an 18-month period with 2 very different but equally challenging operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fast-moving events in Libya saw a five-week exercise for 656 Squadron become a five-month operation, as they went from learning how to operate Apaches on board naval ships to flying operational missions for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taking off from a moving ship to fly over sea at night without lights into a high threat environment challenged the pilots, while the ground crew had to adapt to safely maintaining aircraft in the confined spaces of a ship. For 654 and 664 Squadrons it was a busy and demanding tour of Afghanistan that presented a very different environment, role and threat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parental Child Abduction is a worldwide problem</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year alone the Foreign Office’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/child-abduction/" title="International parental child abduction"&gt;Child Abduction Section&lt;/a&gt; fielded an average of four calls per day to its specialist advice line, more than half of which were new cases .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-worldwide-problem"&gt;A worldwide problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parental child abduction – where a parent takes a child without the permission of those with parental responsibility – is now a worldwide issue. In 2003/04 we worked on cases in 51 countries; now cases relate to 84 different countries, showing just how widespread the problem has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also fear that these statistics are just the tip of the iceberg; many cases go unreported as parents seek custody of their children through foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="raising-awareness"&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public understanding of parental child abduction is alarmingly low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research we commissioned shows that half the UK population believes the government can intervene to order the return of a child to the UK if he or she has been abducted by a parent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that whilst help is available, parental child abduction cases can take years to resolve. This has significant impact on those concerned and there is the strong possibility that the child may never be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also much harder to return a child from a country that has not signed the 1980 Hague Convention, an international agreement between certain countries which aims to ensure the return of a child who has been abducted by a parent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="legal-and-financial-reality"&gt;Legal and financial reality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite parental child abduction being against the law, a quarter (24%) of people do not think, or are unaware, that it’s a crime for a parent to take their child overseas without the consent of others with parental responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked which parent they thought was more likely to abduct a child, three quarters (74%) of people thought it was fathers. Yet according to statistics from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.reunite.org/" title="reunite"&gt;Reunite International Child Abduction Centre&lt;/a&gt;, 70% of the charity’s cases concern mothers taking the child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as this emotional distress, both parents may often face severe financial difficulties as they fight for custody of their child through foreign courts. The statistics show that people tend to underestimate just how much getting a child back costs, including legal fees overseas and in the UK which may continue to mount up even after  the child is returned to this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be a lack of awareness about who pays the costs of resolving a parental child abduction case involving a non-Hague country. Sixty-two per cent either didn’t know or responded with the wrong answer, and only 38% answered correctly by saying it was the parents who would pay, not the UK Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-expert-view"&gt;The expert view&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daisy Organ, head of the Foreign Offfice Child Abduction Section said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The increase in parental child abduction cases is a major cause for concern, particularly in the lead up to the school holidays; we know that before or during school holidays is one of the most common times for a child to be abducted. We hope that this campaign will help inform and educate the UK public and encourage parents thinking of abducting their child to think twice before they cause significant distress to themselves and their family. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison Shalaby, Chief Executive of Reunite, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is important to remember that parental child abduction is not faith or country specific. 71% of the UK public thought that parents most commonly abduct their children to the Middle East, India and Pakistan but it can happen to anyone, from any background. Countries where children are abducted to can range from Australia, to France, to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have seen a 20% increase in calls made to our helpline in the first half of 2012 compared to 2011  and a 67% increase in the number of children who have been abducted by a parent to a non-Hague country between 2001 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This issue is not going away and with a 47% increase in the number of child abduction cases Reunite has worked on between 2001 and 2011, we are urging parents to think twice before they abduct their child or seek help if they think their child is at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Secretary condemns Democratic People’s Republic of Korea satellite launch</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I strongly condemn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) satellite launch today. This launch was a clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 as it involved the testing of ballistic missile technology. This provocative act will increase tensions in the region. I deplore the fact that the DPRK has chosen to prioritise this launch over improving the livelihood of its people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will be summoning the DPRK Ambassador to the UK to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK will urgently consult partners in the United Nations Security Council on our response to this development. It is essential that the DPRK refrain from further provocative action and take constructive steps towards denuclearisation and lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Secretary remarks at Friends of the Syrian People meeting </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from over 130 countries and international organisations met in Marrakesh for the fourth Friends of Syria meeting to support the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian People. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the meeting the Foreign Secretary William Hague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thank the Government of Morocco and H.M. King Mohammed VI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Twenty-two months ago the people of Syria asked for change. Their government responded by pounding cities into rubble, plunging four million people into desperate humanitarian need, and sowing fear and insecurity across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As Friends of the Syrian people, we have done much to seek a peaceful end to the conflict. But we remain deeply disappointed by the failure of the international community to put its full weight behind the agreement made in Geneva six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Syria needs a political transition leading to an inclusive new government, with full executive authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the course most likely to achieve stability in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But in the United Kingdom we do not rule out any option to save lives. In addition, the Assad regime should not doubt our resolve, or miscalculate how we would react to any use of chemical or biological weapons against the Syrian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As the Friends of the Syrian people, we have four immediate responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“First, we must increase our political support for and recognition of the Syrian National Coalition. I encourage other nations to recognise them as we have done in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The people of Syria need to feel the solid ground of a unified political alternative to the Assad regime. The National Coalition has now begun to offer that hope, and it is only right that we give them the recognition they deserve, and the support they need to survive and to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some countries have resisted the idea of a transition because they have seen no alternative to Assad’s leadership. Well now the world can see that there is an alternative, and I urge all countries including Russia and China to work with us to end the conflict. If they do, they will find us constructive partners, and I commend Special Envoy Brahimi for his efforts in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Second, I appeal to all countries here to give practical support to the Syrian National Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The United Kingdom has given over £7 million of non-lethal support, including communication equipment and human rights training.  We will provide a further £1 million in communication support, and look to expand our assistance, through the leadership of the National Coalition, following the deployment of a UK Stabilisation Response Team to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the new Assistance Coordination Unit established in Cairo, which will be able to help co-ordinate  non-lethal assistance to the Syrian people including to the Local Coordination Committees inside Syria, and we call on all countries here to give it active support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we increase our support to the Syrian people we must also increase the pressure on Assad and his allies. I call again on all countries to implement sanctions, and to ensure that their territory is not used as a conduit for arms or assistance to the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Third, we must ensure the international community is ready to provide rapid assistance to a future government in Syria in order to help a political transition succeed. We need to be ready to react to change on the ground, which could happen suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We look to the National Coalition to develop further detailed plans for achieving and implementing transition working with all Syria’s communities, and to uphold human rights and international law, including humanitarian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fourth and finally, we must do more to alleviate Syria’s humanitarian tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The United Kingdom has provided £53.5 million so far in humanitarian aid which is providing 100,000 people with food, blankets and warm clothing, and we have helped 30,000 sick and wounded people by funding hospitals, mobile clinics and training for health workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many other countries have given generously too, but it cannot be right that the UN appeal for Syria is still underfunded.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we gather in this beautiful city we should remember that 50% of all Syria’s refugees are children. The majority are not in school, are living in makeshift shelters in the depths of winter, and many have lost their families. They represent Syria’s future. Their safety, their education, and their ability to return to their home matter to Syria, and to the peace and security of the region. So I urge all countries to do more to help share the burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As part of our new initiative on preventing sexual violence in conflict, the UK has deployed experts to the region to provide training on documentation of sexual violence which we hope will support future prosecutions and care for survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do not know how long the conflict in Syria will last. But uniting the international community around these efforts, helping the National Coalition to win the confidence of the Syrian people, planning for a peaceful future for the country and protecting the victims of the violence on whom that future will rest, is surely the right way to seek to end the conflict and stop the appalling loss of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government publishes Afghanistan progress report </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written statement to parliament the Foreign Secretary William Hague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, together with the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development, is today publishing the twenty second progress report on developments in Afghanistan since November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 October the UN Security Council adopted resolution 2069 (2012) extending the authorisation of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) by a further year. The resolution provided a 12 month roll-over of the Chapter VII authorisation, with an unqualified “all necessary measures” provision. It also incorporated NATO Chicago Summit commitments to support the training, equipping, financing and capability development of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) up to and beyond 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Afghanistan held the first meeting of the Afghanistan-UK Joint Commission chaired by Afghanistan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Jawed Ludin and Baroness Warsi to review implementation of the Enduring Strategic Partnership document signed by President Karzai and the Prime Minister in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 25 October the International Development Committee (IDC) published its Afghanistan: Progress and Prospects after 2014 report. The Government welcomes this report. The Department for International Development will shortly publish a formal response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 31 October the Afghan Independent Election Commission (IEC) publicly announced that 5 April 2014 would be the date for the next Presidential Election in Afghanistan. The Provincial Council elections, postponed from 2013, will also take place on 5 April. As part of this announcement, the IEC published an ambitious timeline for the full electoral processes. Although the timeline as it stands does not cover the Parliamentary elections due in 2015, it effectively meets the Afghan commitment at the Tokyo Development Conference to produce a timeline by early 2013. An implementation plan is set to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October typically marks the end of the so called Afghan Summer fighting season. This time is used by insurgents to recuperate and plan. Overall the levels of violence are likely to decline, and in accordance with seasonal norms, we can expect the character of operations to change during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four members of UK Armed Forces lost their lives while deployed on operations in Afghanistan in October. The two separate incidents that caused these deaths were assessed to be the result of insider attacks. We take these attacks and their causes extremely seriously and we continue to work at the highest level to reduce the risk of insider attacks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of Afghanistan continued to progress plans for the privatisation of the New Kabul Bank. The first in a series of investor road shows took place in October. A road show in Dubai is planned for November. Tenders are being managed by the Afghan Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, and the Cabinet. The process aims to attract high quality investors. The New Kabul Bank is a commercially viable bank, with 550 million USD of deposits and over 100 branches across Afghanistan. As one of the largest banks in Afghanistan, its survival is important for economic development and jobs. The UK is supporting the Afghan Government with the sale of the Bank, thus promoting a transparent and effective process.&lt;br&gt;
I am placing the report in the Library of the House. It will also be published on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK calls for an immediate return to civilian rule in Mali</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister made his comments following the arrest late on 10 December of Malian Prime Minister Diarra in Bamako by armed men on behalf of the military junta and the subsequent forced resignation of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet earlier today. Mr Simmonds said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply concerned by the latest events in Bamako, and particularly by the intervention of the Malian military junta which has forced the resignation today of Prime Minister Diarra and his Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The United Kingdom calls for an immediate return to civilian rule in Mali. The rapid appointment of a new government of national unity to take forward the political roadmap towards democratic elections and the reunification of Mali is critical to further progress. These events underline the need for coordinated international action, particularly with the United Nations, the African Union and ECOWAS, to achieve stability in Mali.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Light Dragoons receive Afghanistan medals</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medal parade was the last in a series of events marking the end off the Regiment’s deployment to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colonel of the Regiment, Major General Andrew Stewart, presented the campaign medals to the soldiers who have conducted homecoming parades in recent weeks in Barnsley, Newcastle and Dereham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicknamed ‘England’s Northern Cavalry’ this was the Regiment’s fourth tour of Afghanistan, having had Squadrons deployed in 2006, 2007 and 2009. Although a very successful tour, it was not without sacrifice and The Light Dragoons will always remember all those who died including Sergeant Lee Davidson who was Killed in Action on 9 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/armoured/regiments/26876.aspx" title="The Light Dragoons"&gt;The Light Dragoons&lt;/a&gt; have undertaken a number of different roles in Afghanistan. The soldiers from A Squadron acted as the eyes and ears of the Brigade. They also provided route security for convoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D Squadron delivered training and mentoring support to the Afghan National Police Force and were later augmented by members of A Squadron. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Light Dragoons march through Dereham" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/2654/16x-2012-119-0070g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The streets of Dereham came to a standstill on Wednesday 5 December as residents and businesses welcomed members of The Light Dragoons home from Afghanistan [Picture: Corporal Obi Igbo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their fellow Light Dragoons sister unit, B Squadron, were The Brigade Reconnaissance Force (&lt;abbr title="Brigade Reconnaissance Force"&gt;BRF&lt;/abbr&gt;) who acted on military intelligence to remove key insurgency equipment and personnel from the area of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trooper Phil Burt and Sergeant Richardson who were part of the &lt;abbr title="Brigade Reconnaissance Force"&gt;BRF&lt;/abbr&gt; discovered a 50 calibre machine gun during one of their operations. Sgt Richardson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were preparing to clear a series of compounds when we saw a disturbance on the ground. The machine gun, nicknamed a Sushka, was covered with a sheet in a trench. It had been well maintained and had a box of ammo with it, so for us it was a great find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their six-month tour The Light Dragoons carried out some 248 operations, searched 1,700 Afghan compounds and discovered over three tonnes of Homemade Explosives and significant quantities of other bomb making equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in the UK, C Squadron was the Rear Operations Group, ensuring that the families remaining behind were given the very best welfare support and ensuring that individual soldiers were fully prepared to deploy if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Large crowds in Derehm welcome The Light Dragoons " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/2655/16x-2012-119-0013g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Large crowds, including family and friends of many of those marching, lined the route [Picture: Corporal Obi Igbo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week the Regiment brought Central Norfolk to a standstill when thousands of people gathered on the streets of Dereham to welcome them home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shops closed and business came to a stand still as crowds, six people deep in places, waved flags and cheered as the proud soldiers marched through the streets. The Light Dragoons have been based in Swanton Morley near Dereham for the past 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the parade the Regiment attended a thanksgiving service at St Nicholas Church. Trooper Craig Hoe from Hull said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have had wonderful support at all of our homecoming parades. It’s great to know we have such support from the local community here where we are based and also back home in our recruiting areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The medal parade was also great; it has to the next best thing after my Pass Off Parade. I’m now looking forward to having some time off and enjoying some of my mam’s cooking. I’ve really missed that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Secretary to attend Friends of Syria meeting in Marrakesh</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 December the Friends of Syria will meet to support the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian People &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 22 month conflict over 40,000 people have been killed and 2 million people have been displaced inside Syria. There are daily reports of more deaths and atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth meeting of the Friends of Syria and follows the formation of the Syrian National Coalition in Doha on 11 November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s objective in Marrakesh is to provide support to the Syrian National Coalition as they establish themselves as a credible alternative to the Assad regime. We believe that the Friends of Syria should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Send a clear message to Assad that his position and regime are no longer sustainable by giving more political support to the National Coalition;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide practical support to the Syrian National Coalition in pursuit of a political transition, while also helping local councils in Syria provide essential services;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Re-establish a sense of urgency around planning for a political transition and Syria’s long term future, reinforcing the message that Assad cannot be part of any transition and offering reassurance that fears of a post-Assad vacuum are unfounded.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase efforts to alleviate the horrendous humanitarian suffering as winter approaches. Syria’s neighbours have shown extraordinary generosity, but UN appeals remain critically underfunded. The UK has committed £53.5 million in humanitarian assistance and we are asking for others to contribute to the fund.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syria desperately needs a political transition based on the Geneva Declaration. The UK continues to believe that Russia and China should recognise that President Assad can never recover legitimacy in the eyes of the Syrian people and that they should back UN Arab League Special Envoy Brahimi in bringing about a diplomatic solution to the crisis. We therefore welcome his on-going discussions with the US and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this happens, the UK will continue to do all we can to avoid a drawn-out military conflict by;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;backing the Syrian National Coalition in pursuit of a genuine transition process and supporting them in preparing for political transition;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing pressure on the Syrian regime through the effective implementation and enforcement of sanctions to stop funds used to finance the killing;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ensuring we have maximum flexibility to act in the future following the decision to limit the rollover of the EU arms embargo to three months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Piracy Ransoms Task Force publishes recommendations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force was established by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, after the London Conference on Somalia in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14-nation Task Force, brought together policy makers from some of the world’s largest Flag States (countries where vessels are registered), nations whose seafarers are most commonly at risk, and those countries at the forefront of the military response to piracy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force made four recommendations in its final report to the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia in New York:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a new strategic partnership between Flag States, the private sector and law enforcement agencies that brings together those tackling piracy and those subjected to it in a united effort to break the piracy business model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a more co-ordinated approach to information-sharing to provide evidence to pursue and prosecute all involved in piracy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strengthen co-ordination between Flag States, the private sector and military responders to prepare for potential hostage situations; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage implementation of anti-piracy measures, including greater compliance with Best Management Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s conclusions from the Piracy Ransoms Task Force are a welcome step in the right direction. International action, led by the UK, is starting to beat back in the global fight against piracy. The dramatic reduction in pirate activity in the past year shows how important collective action is, and the recommendations of the Task Force should make it harder for pirates to receive, and to profit from, ransom payments. But seafarers of all nations remain at risk, and we must continue to work to break the piracy business model, with the ultimate ambition of bringing an end to ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK Government firmly supports and endorses the conclusions of the Piracy Ransoms Task Force. Only through the international community working together to break the pirates’ business model will we reach a position whereby pirates are no longer able to receive or profit from ransom payments. The Government will continue to work as a leading member of the Contact Group and with industry in taking forward the implementation of the task force’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Foreign Secretary met the King of Jordan </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Jordan and the UK are longstanding friends and allies and it was a pleasure to welcome King Abdullah to London today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ahead of the meeting of the Friends of Syria in Morocco tomorrow we discussed the growing crisis in that country. I paid tribute to the generosity of the Jordanian people in hosting the significant and growing number of Syrian refugees. And we welcomed the formation of the Syrian National Coalition and its efforts to provide a credible and inclusive alternative to the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We agreed on the need for a new initiative to achieve peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, led by the US and supported by the wider international community. This is needed as a matter of urgency, before the window closes on the two state solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“King Abdullah described his efforts to institute reforms in Jordan that would bring about greater political participation, transparency and economic opportunity. I welcomed these and emphasised the importance of delivering an inclusive political process led by King Abdullah that provides substantive democratic reforms. The UK stands ready to support this work, in particular through the Arab Partnership. We discussed the difficult economic situation in Jordan and what the UK and EU can do to help Jordan carry through difficult but necessary economic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I also expressed appreciation for the assistance provided by the Jordanian Government in our efforts to return Abu Qatada.”  &lt;/p&gt;
