    <title>Call for evidence on the government's review of the balance of competences between the United Kingdom and the European Union</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/images/logos/balance-of-competencies.JPG?w=200&amp;amp;h=50&amp;amp;as=1" alt="Review of the Balance of Competences"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is carrying out a review of the balance of competences between the EU and the UK. This is an audit of what the EU does and how it affects the UK. You can read more about it on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s web page on the balance of competences review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have published our first &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/europe/docs/g/12-1278-government-review-balance-competences-united-kingdom-european-union-call.pdf"&gt;Call for Evidence on the Internal Market: Synoptic Review (PDF, 735 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;. The Synoptic report will cover the overall application and effect of the EU Internal Market. The result of the report will be a comprehensive , thorough and detailed analysis of the wider functioning of the Internal Market. It will determine how the so-called “Four Freedoms” operate together to create an efficient and operating Internal Market and ultimately what this means for the UK. We will subsequently be reviewing each of the “Four Freedoms” in turn in semesters 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone wishing to contribute to the review is asked to send their written views before 28 February 2013 to &lt;a href="mailto:balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;balanceofcompetences@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; or online at &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket"&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/internalmarket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our intention to publish evidence at the end of the review when the reports are published. In the meantime, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills plans to use section 22 to exempt FOI requests around evidence received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>No stone unturned: in pursuit of growth. Lord Heseltine review</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Heseltine has set out a comprehensive economic plan to improve the UK’s ability to create wealth. His independent report makes the case for a major rebalancing of responsibilities for economic development between central and local government, and between government and the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report ‘No stone unturned in pursuit of growth’ makes 89 recommendations which aim to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inject stability into the economy &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create the conditions for growth, and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maximise the performance of the UK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the proposals are measures to unleash the potential of local economies and leaders and enable every part of the UK economy to raise its game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition Lord Heseltine has produced No stone unturned: chamber of commerce - international comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Heseltine presented his report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Business Secretary Vince Cable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="heseltine-review-a-new-partnership-for-growth"&gt;Heseltine review: ‘A new partnership for growth’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government provided a first response Lord Heseltine’s Review at Autumn Statement focusing on local economic growth with a fuller response to come in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response sets a direction for the devolution of government spending to local areas and responds to other parts of Lord Heseltine’s recommendations. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empowering Local Economic Partnerships (LEPs) and devolution of some central funding streams into a single pot from 2015 onwards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regional Growth Fund; government will provide a further £350 million for the Regional Growth Fund, of which £100 million is being contributed from existing budgets&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
