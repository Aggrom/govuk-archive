    <title>Planning performance and the Planning Guarantee</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation links to the Government’s proposals, contained within Clause 1 of the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, to introduce legislation to give applicants the choice of submitting planning applications direct to the secretary of state, where the local planning authority is underperforming.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks views on what measures to use to identify an authority’s performance, how to identify underperformance and how to identify improved performance and related measures to underpin the Planning Guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Enforcement procedures against drink drivers and other offenders</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation encompasses the legislative changes the government proposed in its response of March 2011 to the reports by Sir Peter North and the Transport Select Committee on drink and drug driving (“the Government’s response”). The changes covered in this consultation do not, however, include creating a new offence related to driving with a specified impairing drug in the body, which is also being progressed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed legislative changes relate to Great Britain (and not to Northern Ireland) and will be implemented subject to the outcome of this consultation and the securing of legislative time. The proposals are consistent with the devolution of the drink drive limit in Scotland, through the Scotland Act 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks views about proceeding with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the withdrawal of the ‘statutory option’;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes as to when preliminary breath tests are needed;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to the testing procedures in hospital;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;changes to who can assess whether someone is under the influence of drugs; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;amendments to the regimes for aviation, rail and shipping which mirror the road regime.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is consulting on a set of proposals to make the planning appeals process faster and more transparent, improve consistency and certainty in decision taking timescales. The proposals will bring cost and time benefits for those appealing decisions and local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Removal of motor insurance certificates</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on amending the Road Traffic Act 1988 to remove the need for insurers to issue a motor insurance certificate when an insurance policy is taken out. At present the certificate is used as evidence of valid insurance cover and there are circumstances when it must be produced by the insured to demonstrate they have valid cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers are required by law to enter details of all motor insurance policies onto the motor insurance database (&lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt;). This consultation document considers using the &lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt; as the single source for checking if insurance cover is in place and considers what further changes and developments are needed to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The government is consulting on a set of proposals to amend the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 to allow homeowners and businesses to make larger extensions to their homes and business premises without requiring a planning application, and to allow quicker installation of broadband infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Examining the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum speed limit for heavy goods vehicles (&lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt;) over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads is prescribed in Schedule 6 of the Road Traffic Act 1984. The current speed limit on single carriageways for &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; over 7.5 tonnes is 40 miles per hour. The speed limit for smaller &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles"&gt;HGVs&lt;/abbr&gt; (those between 3.5 tonnes and 7.5 tonnes) is 50 mph. The government made a commitment in ‘The logistics growth review – connecting people with goods’ document published in November 2011, to consult on this issue during 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders have said that the 40 mph speed limit causes unnecessary cost to vehicle operators, congestion, avoidable overtaking accidents and creates an uneven playing field for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freight and logistics sector is an essential part of the economy, vital to businesses of all sizes and sectors. Raising &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; speed limits on single carriageway roads could lead to quicker journeys and lower costs for the sector, aiding economic growth as well as reducing frustration for the many drivers who find themselves stuck behind slower-moving lorries on busy roads unable to overtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there are other consequences of greater speed – both in terms of the environmental impacts and the potential effects on road safety. The department wants to make sure we have carefully considered the evidence of all of the effects on the economy, environment and road safety before any decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the North East regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the North East of England Plan and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the previous environmental report on the revocation of the North East of England regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the North East of England Plan and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S5 from the Northumberland County and National Park Joint Structure Plan First Alteration relating to the green belt at Morpeth. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the Coalition Agreement to safeguard green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Road user charging scheme regulations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department is seeking views on a proposal to provide for the fair and effective enforcement of road user charging schemes. The provisions contained in the proposal will be put into effect through regulations made under the Transport Act 2000, the Road User Charging Schemes (Enforcement) (England) Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulations will allow enforcement actions such as the issuing of penalty charge notices, the examination of vehicles and equipment and the immobilisation, removal, storage and disposal of vehicles. Provisions will also cover arrangements for pursuing debt through the courts and adjudication. We consider that the consultation is of interest specifically to local transport authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
