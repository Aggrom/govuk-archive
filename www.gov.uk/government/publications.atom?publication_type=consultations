    <title>Offering suitable housing to homeless people</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act 2011 enables local authorities to end the main homelessness duty by arranging an offer of suitable accommodation in the private rented sector, without requiring the applicant’s agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed draft Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2012 sets out those circumstances in which accommodation used for the private rented sector offer to end the main homelessness duty is not to be regarded as suitable.  It also looks at how best to strengthen requirements in relation to location and suitability, when local authorities secure accommodation for the use of households owed duties under the homelessness legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Business rates retention: technical details</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technical consultation builds on the proposals in the government response to consultation published in December 2011, and on the statements of intent published on 17 May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seeks views on a range of detailed technical issues concerning practical implementation of those proposals, particularly focusing on how the Government proposes to calculate local authority start-up funding allocations, baseline funding levels as well as other parameters which are required for the setup and operation of the business rates retention scheme. As such, it will be of particular interest to local authority finance departments responsible for implementing and running the new scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 2 focuses on establishing baseline funding levels for each local authority, as well as the methodology for allocating Revenue Support Grant which will be paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The December 2011 consultation response stated that, in the interests of maintaining as much stability as possible, these would be calculated on the basis of the 2012/13 formula grant process with updated data sets and some limited technical updates. This section details proposals for making those calculations and includes exemplifications of the proposed options. It also covers transfers and adjustments to the local government spending controls total and includes proposed methodologies for incorporating those separate grant funding streams being included in the business rates retention scheme from April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 3 outlines other parameters which need to be determined when setting up the business rates retention system - particularly in relation to establishing individual local authority business rate baselines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 4 details proposals on how the system will operate once it has been set up. It is arranged chronologically, to give local authorities the best idea of how the scheme will operate year-by-year. The calculation of levy and safety net payments is set out in this section. The safety net will fall within the 7.5%-10% range and funded by a 1:1 levy as already announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 5 covers the proposed approach to closing the 2012-13 national non domestic rating account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department has published a number of documents to supplement the technical consultation on business rates retention. These documents set out the proposed approach for the London share of business rates and an alternative option for funding the New Homes Bonus. In addition, the Department has published supplementary information on proportionate shares as well as population data. These documents can be found below. Responses to additional consultation questions should be sent as part of the responses to the technical consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The government is also consulting on the draft &lt;em&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/em&gt; until 17 October. As part of this consultation, we welcome views on the consistency of the draft Framework with the draft planning policy for traveller sites, and any other comments about the government’s plans to incorporate planning policy on traveller sites into the final National Planning Policy Framework. The new planning policy statement for traveller sites will be reviewed in the light of all comments received and incorporated into the final National Planning Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the consultation on the National Planning Policy Framework, the government would welcome responses to the following question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Improving local government transparency</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of the ‘Code of recommended practice for local authorities on Data Transparency’ in September 2011, ministers would now like to make the code a legal requirement via regulations, subject to consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to enforce the code through regulations via the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/65/contents" title="Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980"&gt;Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980&lt;/a&gt;, Section 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers wish to hear from all those local authorities listed in paragraph 4 of the code. They would also like to hear from relevant bodies, open data experts, developers, citizen activists and other interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Technical reforms to Council Tax: when dwellings should not be liable to the empty homes premium</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Finance Bill includes provisions that will allow a billing authority to charge an empty homes premium to provide a stronger incentive to get homes back into productive use and remove the blight of such properties on local neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium was subject to a consultation, ‘Technical Reforms to Council Tax’, which ended on 29 December 2011. The government published its response on 28 May 2012, which confirmed its intention to proceed with the premium and stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will not be payable until a dwelling has been empty and unfurnished for 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the maximum premium that an authority will be able to charge will be 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on the government’s proposals on exceptions to the premium: dwellings which may otherwise be liable for the premium, but which are subject to circumstances that mean that it would not be appropriate for it to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
