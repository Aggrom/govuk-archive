    <title>  Life Sciences Strategy: one year on</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="progress"&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that the UK has generated more than £1 billion on industry and private sector investment within 12 months.  This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£500 million from GSK to build its first new manufacturing plant in almost 40 years at Ulverston in Cumbria and invest more in its two sites at Montrose and Irvine in Scotland as a direct response to the introduction of the Patent Box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£25 million leveraged in from the private sector to bridge the ‘Valley of Death’ adding to a government commitment of £49 million to 64 projects through the Biomedical Catalyst&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£294 million through the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (&lt;abbr title="UK Research Partnership Investment Fund"&gt;UK RPIF&lt;/abbr&gt;) from businesses and charities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real progress has been made working closely with companies across the sector to ensure the measures in the strategy are making a real difference to their work and their decisions to invest in and remain in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes investing £1 billion per annum through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; to boost networks between academia, industry and the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="revolutionising-the-fight-against-cancer"&gt;Revolutionising the fight against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Cameron also announced that the UK will be the first country in the world to introduce to introduce high-tech &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; mapping for cancer patients and those with rare diseases, within the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.  Up to  100,000 patients over three to five years will have their whole genome – their personal &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; code –sequenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genome profile will give doctors a new, advanced understanding of a patient’s genetic make-up, condition and treatment needs, ensuring they have access to the right drugs and personalised care far quicker than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to develop life-saving new drugs, treatments and scientific breakthroughs, which experts predict could significantly reduce the number of premature deaths from cancer within a generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has earmarked £100 million: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to train a new generation of British genetic scientists to lead on the development of new drugs, treatments and cures, building the UK as the world leader in the field. And train the wider healthcare community in harnessing this technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to pump-prime &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; sequencing for cancer and rare inherited diseases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to build the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; data infrastructure to ensure that this new technology leads to better care for patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="reaction"&gt;Reaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Science and Universities David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life sciences is one of the most truly international sectors – so if we are to continue to be a world player and compete in the global race we must do everything we can to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past year, our initiatives have attracted more than £1 billion of private sector investment to the UK. We can see clear evidence the UK is succeeding in creating the right environment to attract global investment to our shores and continue to be world leader in life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am announcing today that we are committing a further £100 million to support this sector out of the extra money for science announced by the chancellor in his Autumn Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Skills for life survey reveals English and maths levels of adults</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills for Life examines the maths, English and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) levels of 16-65 year olds across England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest findings found that in some areas, around a quarter of adults have the numeracy skills of a seven to nine year old or below. In Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands and the South East, there was a boost in literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/imagelibrary/downloadmedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=6131&amp;amp;SizeId=-1"&gt;Regional breakdown of the findings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the survey, Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said that adults with poor English and maths skills should make the most of free Government help. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good English and maths are vital for getting a job and playing a full part in society. We have doubled the funding for adult English and maths because they are so important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would urge anyone who is struggling to take advantage of the provision that is on offer which now includes maths and English GCSEs for adults who missed out the first time round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These essential skills are the building blocks of a productive society and a thriving economy. I am determined that everyone - no matter where they live - should have the chance to achieve their very best.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="five-ways-we-use-maths-everyday"&gt;Five ways we use maths everyday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding offers in shops e.g. buy one get one free, two for the price of one, 20% off &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding the pay and deductions on your payslip &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning a journey by train or bus and reading timetables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take/give the right amount of medicine/pills for you or a member of your family&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work out the best mobile phone deal that you can afford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="help-available"&gt;Help available&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government has introduced a number of measures to improve the nation’s basic skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free maths and English GCSEs for adults since August&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continued funding of basic English and maths courses for adults&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New study programmes for young people from September 2013 in which students will continue to work towards GCSE A*-C in English and maths if they do not have this by 16&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consultation on the introduction of new English Baccalaureate Certificates for young people in six core academic subjects including English and maths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults wanting to brush up on their maths, English and ICT skills can contact the &lt;a href="nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/a&gt; for advice or call them on 0800 100 900 for information on courses available via the National Careers Service course directory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Strategy for UK Life Sciences – One Year On</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="check-against-delivery"&gt;Check against delivery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is an exciting time to be discussing the prospects for life sciences in the UK. We have a positive story to tell – right up to the announcements of the past week, with more than £100 million of dedicated funding for life sciences capital in the Autumn Statement and the pioneering genomics programme confirmed by the Prime Minister in Cambridge on Monday, which comes with up to £100 million more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two years ago, however, and the situation was rather different. Indeed, while today’s event is all about reflecting on the progress we’ve made in the past 12 months since the launch of the Government’s Strategy for UK Life Sciences, I’m like to start further back – with Pfizer’s decision to close its R&amp;amp;D operations at Sandwich. Learning of that decision in early 2011 – not so long after AstraZeneca had elected to shut its facility at Charnwood – provided the starkest of warnings. It brought home the major changes underway globally in the life sciences industry: the shift away from in-house R&amp;amp;D to external collaborations and partnerships; the increasing mobility of capital as other countries raise their game and, therefore, the need for an integrated approach to attract investment and maintain competitive advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the Sandwich taskforce certainly taught us a great deal about the direction in which the industry is heading. And then, in June last year, the Prime Minister hosted a valuable and interesting seminar focused on life sciences which clearly demonstrated that we need to do better to make the necessary connections between our outstanding research base, our increasingly diverse life sciences sector – one featuring a growing number of SMEs – and our clinical strengths across the National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was these fundamental insights that informed the preparation of the life sciences strategy published this time last year. In it, we determined to achieve three main things. The first was to dramatically improve collaboration between academia, industry and the NHS. The second was to boost the skills and pipeline of researchers, clinicians and technicians – without whom collaboration could not be properly realised. And the third was to foster the right business environment in the UK to encourage investment, so that we could translate discovery into real benefits for patients, support innovation through the translational funding gap, and remove bureaucratic barriers to the early adoption and diffusion of medical breakthroughs in the NHS. This week we published the Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On report, showing lots of progress is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first of these ambitions – boosting collaboration in a stronger life sciences ecosystem – the Medical Research Council has promised £130 million for work on stratified and experimental medicine, with the first round of grant recipients in stratified medicine, announced on Monday, tackling rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and Gaucher’s disease. These three awards will establish research consortia in each of these disease areas and taken in total will combine 34 academic groups and 20 industry partners with charities and patients across the UK. We are investing £1 billion per annum through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new Biomedical Catalyst, established to bridge the gap between innovative research and actual commercialisation, is already funding some great projects: to develop a new vaccine for the hospital-acquired infection C. difficile, which currently kills around 3,000 people a year in the UK; to advance a treatment for late-stage Parkinson’s that significantly reduces patients’ time in surgery; to utilise a mobile phone app that helps people with conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to manage them more effectively on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also made good progress on our second objective to support skills and talent. We’ve seen the launch of the dedicated Technical Apprenticeship Service, confirmation of the first eight Research Professorships under the aegis of the National Institute for Health Research and the successful piloting of the Society of Biology’s degree accreditation programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to our third objective of having a competitive business environment. From April 2013, the Patent Box will come into force – offering a 10 per cent corporation tax rate on profits attributable to patents. To optimise the commercial environment, we are also improving the visibility and certainty of R&amp;amp;D tax relief. We hope that the introduction of an above the line R&amp;amp;D tax credit will attract large scale investment in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all exciting, tangible stuff – promising for patients, promising for business and job creation. What’s vital now is that the work of integration continues, refining a system that makes full and optimum use of every one of its constituent elements. Ours is a 10 year strategy – and it hinges on achieving success in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take public investment. The ring-fenced science settlement, agreed early on by the Coalition, was a serious commitment in these straitened times – and we have built on it since. The latest money in the Autumn Statement will build the necessary research capability for the UK to compete globally in a potential $100 billion synthetic biology market. It will fund the development of a large manufacturing facility for biologic medicines such as antibodies and vaccines – improving our marketability as the location of choice for internationally mobile life sciences companies. And it will help fund imaging and cell manufacture technologies and a clean room for the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we pumped £42 million into the life sciences sector in 2012 through the Regional Growth Fund, matched by private investment of almost £185 million. We have committed £300 million for the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund. To secure investment, universities are required to match by at least double the amount they receive from the fund from non-public sources. There are several projects relevant to life sciences around the UK that have secured funding of almost £147 million. However, we understand in the UK that financial resource alone is not enough to make us the go-to destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On increasing the take up of medical innovation on the ground, the Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure at the NIHR - or NOCRI as it is known - is starting to connect industry to the best investigators, research facilities and technologies. We know that we also need to continue improvement in study performance and there is a new 70-day benchmark for providers of NHS services to proceed from receiving a valid research application to recruiting the first patient. It has been a condition of new NIHR contracts since December 2011, and performance against this will affect further funding as of April 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this and several other measures in the strategy, we know that we will only be able to truly assess impact once they have been fully implemented. For example, earlier this week Sir David Nicholson said we know good progress is being made at a time of great change in the NHS but more always remains to be done. There are deep-seated barriers to innovation that must be changed right at the heart of the NHS. David Nicholson and the new Commissioning Board will continue to push ahead to achieve a true culture of innovation throughout the NHS which is important to patients and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message we’re seeking to transmit globally is that life sciences companies can do everything they need to in this country. They can, like Astellas Pharma, establish their headquarters here. They can, like Eli Lilly, conduct early-stage research here – exploiting UK-based expertise in an unusually broad range of disciplines, from clinical pharmacology to statistics and data sciences. Or, like GSK and Eisai, they can establish cutting-edge manufacturing plants on these shores. In the past year, the UK has received more than £1 billion of industry and private sector investment – from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Novartis and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate our capacity for pioneering research, we will of course be taking forward the large-scale genomics project – the first attempt to exploit this technology within a mainstream health system. As the Prime Minister explained on Monday, we’ll be sequencing the entire genome of up to 100,000 patients. As patterns emerge, doctors will gain more advanced understanding of cancers and inherited diseases, enabling more targeted care. A critical feature of the project, which relates to one of my earlier comments, is how it will provide the training ground for a new generation of British geneticists and will educate the wider community in harnessing genomics technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it is essential that international companies appreciate what’s available in the UK – the knowhow, the facilities, the opportunities to conduct clinical trials. That’s where UK Trade and Investment come in. Earlier this year, UKTI established the Life Science Investment Organisation to help connect international investors and companies with all parts of our life sciences sector. Later on at today’s event, the UKTI will launch a new global campaign highlighting the many opportunities to invest in and partner with our knowledge base, our SMEs, our manufacturers and our commercial supply chain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2012, I’m proud to report that there are over 380 pharmaceutical companies based in the UK, employing nearly 70,000 people, with an annual turnover of £30 billion. The medical technology and medical biotechnology sectors represent over 4,000 companies employing nearly 100,000 people with an annual turnover of around £20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task ahead is to build on this solid base by encouraging more spinouts, attracting more companies from overseas and further investment. We’ll be sticking with the strategy formulated a year ago with such wise counsel from experts such as Sir John Bell, Chris Brinsmead and George Freeman – and we’ll be continually exploring ways to make the UK the best place in the world to pursue life sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The new home on the web for FCO, MOD, BIS and AGO</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four central government departments and several of their public bodies have today (13 December, 2012) become the latest central government organisations to move their corporate and policy content onto the new GOV.UK website - the new single home for all government services and information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (&lt;abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt;), Ministry of Defence (&lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;), Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;) and Attorney General’s Office (&lt;abbr title="Attorney General's Office"&gt;AGO&lt;/abbr&gt;) have moved their content to the new website, joining the Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DFT&lt;/abbr&gt;) and Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;) whose content moved to GOV.UK last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inside Government section on GOV.UK makes it simpler, clearer and faster to find out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how government works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what the government is doing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how you can get involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="new-web-addresses"&gt;New web addresses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All web addresses have been redirected, so you don’t need to update your bookmarks, but you might want to make a note of the new addresses: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/fco" title="FCO"&gt;www.gov.uk/fco&lt;/a&gt; - Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/mod" title="MOD"&gt;www.gov.uk/mod&lt;/a&gt; - Ministry of Defence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/bis" title="BIS"&gt;www.gov.uk/bis&lt;/a&gt; - Department for Business, Innovation and Skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/ago" title="AGO"&gt;www.gov.uk/ago&lt;/a&gt; - Attorney General’s Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inside Government section of GOV.UK has been designed to make government information easier to find and more transparent for the user. For the first time, you can begin to find out what’s happening inside government all in one place, and in a clear, consistent and transparent format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the new website looks very different from the ones it has replaced. The look is one obvious difference but many of the other significant changes are less visible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="topics"&gt;Topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now see information from multiple government departments grouped by topics. For example, you can see how policies from &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; are contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/national-security"&gt;national security&lt;/a&gt; or combating &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/climate-change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="clear-policies"&gt;Clear policies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those departments and agencies who have moved to GOV.UK are publishing their policies according to the outcome the government is trying to achieve. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-it-easier-to-set-up-and-grow-a-business--6" title="making it easier to set up and grow a business"&gt;making it easier to set up and grow a business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/promoting-human-rights-internationally" title="promoting human rights internationally"&gt;promoting human rights internationally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working-towards-nuclear-disarmament" title="working towards nuclear disarmament"&gt;working towards nuclear disarmament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each policy, you can see a list of all the related announcements, consultations and publications in one list, called ‘activity’. The activity tab makes it easy for you to track what is happening on the policies that interest you, for example all government activity that relates to &lt;a href="/government/policies/establishing-stability-in-afghanistan/activity" title="establishing stability in Afghanistan: activity"&gt;establishing stability in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="more-about-inside-government-and-govuk"&gt;More about Inside Government and GOV.UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside Government is still a work in progress, with only some organisations live. Work will continue as other departments and organisations, many hundreds in total, move their information to GOV.UK. This will happen in batches and will be completed by March 2014.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more here: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two new council members appointed to Competition Commission</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition Minister Jo Swinson said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m delighted to welcome Dame Janet and Penny to the Competition Commission. They both bring invaluable experience and expertise, which will be hugely beneficial to the work of the Commission, especially during its transition phase, working towards the creation of the new Competition and Markets Authority.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Notes for Editors  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. Dame Janet and Penny Boys have both been appointed for a maximum term of two years. The Competition and Markets Authority is expected to become fully operational by April 2014, which is also the date the Competition Commission will be formally abolished. These appointments will come to an end on the date of the abolition of the Commission.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They will be paid pro-rata, based on a daily rate of £350. The appointments carry no right of pension, gratuity or allowance on termination.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The appointments have been made in accordance with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) Code of Practice.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All appointments are made on merit, and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity to be made public. Neither of the new members is politically active.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rt Hon. Dame Janet Paraskeva DBE was appointed as the first Chair of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission in November 2007 and the First Civil Service Commissioner on 1 January 2006. She worked for HM Inspector of Schools until 1988 and has served as chief executive at the Law Society and was Director for England of the National Lottery Charities Board as well serving as a magistrate and as a member of the Youth Justice Board. In 2005, she was appointed to the board of Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency as a non-executive director and in 2006 she was appointed as head of the new Olympic Lottery Distributor (OLD). In July 2010, she was appointed by the Prime Minister as one of three members of an inquiry to determine whether British intelligence officers were complicit in the torture of detainees, and was made a member of the Privy Council. In 1978, she was awarded the Robert Schuman Silver Medal for European Unity and was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Penny Boys, CB, is a non-executive director of Ofwat and has been the Chief Executive of the Competition Commission, the Executive Director in the OFT, the first Deputy Director General at the office of Electricity Regulation and served as Head of Personnel at the DTI. She has also worked at the Treasury, the former Department of Energy and was seconded to the British National Oil Corporation. She is also one of Network Rail’s Member Selection Panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Competition Commission is a statutory body set up by the Competition Act 1998 and replaced the old Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The Commission conducts in-depth inquiries into mergers, markets and the regulation of the major regulated industries. In most merger and market references the Commission is responsible for making decisions on the competition questions and for making and implementing decisions on appropriate remedies. Every inquiry is undertaken in response to a reference made to it by another authority, usually the Office of Fair Trading. The Commission has no power to conduct inquiries on its own initiative.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commission consists of a Chairman, 3 Deputy Chairmen, 2 Council Members and around 37 Panel Members. There is a Chief Executive and around 150 staff. The Council is the CC’s strategic management board; it is led by the Chairman and consists of the three Deputy Chairmen, the Chief Executive, and non-executive Council members. The Council meets at least six times a year to consider the plans and strategic direction of the CC and to review recent inquiries, high-level risks and discuss best practice across inquiry groups.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boosting skills and jobs on the south coast</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Cable was in Southampton to launch two key schemes to improve skills and create sustainable employment, following on from new investment launched in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/as2012_index.htm"&gt;Chancellor’s Autumn Statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He visited Eastleigh College to announce a new £550 million Further Education Capital Investment Fund to help improve college facilities across the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That investment  will be targeted towards colleges in the greatest need of help to improve facilities, improve efficiency and save money in the long term. Colleges will be able to apply for funding through the Skills Funding Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extra £310 million for the Regional Growth Fund to create and safeguard jobs was also announced in the Autumn Statement.  To date, £2.4 billion has been conditionally offered to businesses and intermediaries up and down the country – creating jobs and boosting the local economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south coast has benefited from a number of different Regional Growth Fund projects and programmes. The Solent LEP has been awarded £2m from the Regional Growth Fund to roll out the second phase of the successful Bridging the Gap Funding programme to Southampton and the Isle of Wight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other beneficiaries of Regional Growth Fund awards for the area include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southampton City Council has been awarded a further £5.3 million Regional Growth Fund in support of the ‘Platform for Prosperity’ project bringing the total to £10.9 million. The project entails the improvement and upgrade of the road infrastructure outside Eastern Docks and is expected to create or safeguard over 800 jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cobra Precision Engineering and Elite Care Homes are two of the first recipients of £100,000 of phase one of the Solent LEPs Bridging the Gap award. The grant will leverage close to £600,000 additional private investment and create and safeguard 12 jobs at the two firms. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Solent Future’s project is a £13m Regional Growth Fund money investment from Round 3. Part of the funding will be utilised to ensure a sustainable future for the Advanced Manufacturing skills in the Solent workforce. This will bring together leading businesses, colleges and Universities at a world-class training centre on the Solent Enterprise Zone. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Portsmouth Naval Base Property Trust in Portsmouth secured £1.23 million of Regional Growth Fund to support two projects within the Historic Dockyard at Portsmouth. 
£750,000 will be used to develop the Cell Block Enterprise project which will support enterprise skills development and provide access to early stage funding with mentoring managed by the University of Portsmouth. The project aims to create over 440 jobs in the supply chain. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£475,000 will contribute to the development of the International Boatbuilding Training College (IBTC) which combines heritage conservation with apprenticeships and other training to develop transferrable skills. The project has also had initial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund which could result in a final grant of £3.9 million grant to help support the development of heritage skills for the future. Both projects will have a ten year economic life cycle. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Vince Cable launches schemes for skills and jobs on South Coast</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable visited Eastleigh College to announce a new £550 million Further Education Capital Investment Fund which will help improve college facilities across the country. He also announced an additional £310 million for the Regional Growth Fund to create and safeguard jobs. Both schemes will support growth in the economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital investment will be targeted towards colleges in the greatest need of help to improve facilities, improve efficiency and save money in the long term. Colleges will be able to apply for funding through the Skills Funding Agency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the visit, the Business Secretary toured the College’s Technology Skills Centre where he met apprentices learning a range of practical disciplines from plumbing to electrical installation. He also saw the Engage Recruitment unit which works with the local JobCentre Plus to help students of all ages develop their skills, qualifications and work experience in order to find employment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastleigh College is a member of the Ford Multi Agency Task Force which has been set up to address the impact of any job losses from Ford in Southampton. Dr Cable saw how the college is working with local business to help support the unemployed get back to work with different job opportunities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Southampton is facing some serious challenges. The Ford van closure was undoubtedly a big blow. But there are some real strengths in the region including the universities and colleges. Eastleigh College plays an important role in the region and its economy. It is heavily involved in the Ford Multi Agency Task Force in Southampton and its’ strong relationship with local business will help produce the highly skilled people the economy needs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The quality of further education facilities should match the aspiration of the sector which is why the Government is stepping up capital spending, over the next two years £550 million is being invested in transforming colleges across the country, providing thousands of students with much better facilities.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastleigh College Chief Executive Tony Lau Walker said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One hundred per cent of Eastleigh College’s focus is working directly with employers to ensure a prosperous economic future for the region and enable local people to have the employment skills valued by employers for their business growth. New capital funds will ensure Eastleigh College can invest in new facilities and technologies to meet the needs of a growing economy.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further announcement from the Autumn Statement was that an additional £310 million will be added to the Government’s Regional Growth Fund. So far, £2.4 billion has been conditionally offered to businesses and intermediaries up and down the country - creating jobs and boosting the local economy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The south coast has benefited from a number of different Regional Growth Fund projects and programmes. The Solent LEP has been awarded £2m from the Regional Growth Fund to roll out the second phase of the successful Bridging the Gap Funding programme to Southampton and the Isle of Wight.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme is a partnership between Solent LEP, Southampton City Council and the local newspaper, The Daily Echo, to award grant funding to SMEs and startup businesses on a competitive basis. The programme is expected to create or safeguard 200 jobs over the next three years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bid was prioritised and moved through the RGF process quickly in light of the potential Ford closure. This will help workers at Ford who may be looking at self-employment as an option and those SMEs in the Ford supply chain that will require support recalibrating their business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other beneficiaries of Regional Growth Fund awards for the area include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southampton City Council has been awarded a further £5.3 million Regional Growth Fund in support of the ‘Platform for Prosperity’ project bringing the total to £10.9 million. The project entails the improvement and upgrade of the road infrastructure outside Eastern Docks and is expected to create or safeguard over 800 jobs. The investment outside of the port by the public sector, has given ABP Ports the confidence to invest over £200 million within the port estate over the next few years bringing significant benefits to local enterprises that use the port.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cobra Precision Engineering and Elite Care Homes are two of the first recipients of £100,000 of phase one of the Solent LEPs Bridging the Gap award. The grant will leverage close to £600,000 additional private investment and create and safeguard 12 jobs at the two firms. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Solent Future’s project is a £13m Regional Growth Fund money investment from Round 3.

Both projects will have a ten year economic life cycle. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Regional Growth Fund is helping to stimulate private sector investment and is having a beneficial effect in communities across the country. The additional £310 million of funding will help us support more projects and create more jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This reflects the success of the fund and the positive impact it is having on jobs - whether it is small SMEs such as Cobra Precision Engineering or larger infrastructure projects. The work of Solent LEP, Southampton Council and other stakeholders is crucial in linking up the public and private sectors to boost economic growth.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug Morrison, Solent LEP Chairman, said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Solent LEP have worked hard to ensure that national funding opportunities such as the Regional Growth Fund are accessible to entrepreneurs and SMEs locally in the Solent; and our work with The Daily Echo, The News, The University of Portsmouth and other organisations on Bridging the Gap is a fantastic example of this.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are finding that locally, we are able to administer funding extremely quickly and efficiently, and the first two funding recipients from Bridging the Gap announced by Dr Cable today highlight this. Of course this investment comes at a challenging time for the Solent economy; and the work we are doing with Eastleigh College on the Ford task force and the investment we have been able to secure for schemes like phase 2 of Bridging the Gap and Platform Road in Southampton will help our economy come through this difficult period.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Notes to Editors  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. Eastleigh College is one of the largest employer engaging colleges in the south east. In 2011/12 the college worked with 22,000 learners and 1,400 employers and was inspected by Ofsted as Grade 1 ‘Outstanding’ in July 2012.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FE Capital Investment Strategy can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/F/12-1340-further-education-college-capital-investment-strategy-plan"&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/F/12-1340-further-education-college-capital-investment-strategy-plan&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colleges are normally expected to contribute at least double the government grant contribution. On this basis a £550m government contribution is expected to enable college projects valued at in excess of ??1.65bn. The £550m capital funds are over 2 years - 2013-14 and 2014-15.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An evaluation of the impact of capital expenditure on FE college outcomes, used to inform the FE College Capital Investment Strategy is being published on the same day as the announcement of the Strategy. The evaluation can be found at (DN insert link)  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Regional Growth Fund (RGF) is a £2.6bn fund operating across England from 2011 to 2015. It supports projects and programmes that lever private sector investment to create economic growth and sustainable employment. It aims particularly to help those areas and communities which were dependent on the public sector to make the transition to sustainable private sector-led growth and prosperity.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first three rounds allocated £2.4 billion and will leverage over £13 billion of private sector investment - creating and safeguarding 540,000 jobs.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Autumn Statement 2012 provided for an additional £310 million of Regional Growth Fund money. Government will confirm how applicants can apply for funding in due course.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More information on the Regional Growth Fund can be found here: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/rgf"&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/rgf&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) is a locally-owned partnership between businesses, local authorities and higher and further education, and plays a central role in determining local economic priorities and undertaking activities to drive economic growth and the creation of local jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Solent LEP is led by the business community and supported by university partners, the further education sector, three unitary authorities, eight district councils, one county council and the voluntary and community sector - all working together to secure a more prosperous and sustainable future for the Solent area.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries.’ It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New £550m capital investment programme will transform FE colleges</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new FE Capital Investment Strategy details the creation of a £550 million investment programme targeted at colleges in the greatest need of help and those that can support growth in the economy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of decades of underinvestment too many learners are in poor facilities which are expensive to maintain, impacting on the quality of learning. Improving the skills of the nation’s workforce is central to this Government’s industrial strategy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FE Capital Investment Strategy sets out the clear rationale for the investment:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;800,000 learners in England are currently learning in sub-standard buildings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every £1 million of capital expenditure increases participation by between approximately 62 and 86 learners per year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A £5 million college refurbishment project could typically employ around 60 people and could increase to as much as 600 jobs for a £20 million college relocation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Annual maintenance costs for the worst colleges are 34 per cent higher than the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable made the announcement on a visit to Eastleigh College, Hampshire, which has just replaced temporary huts with seven new classrooms supported by Government funding. Photovoltaic solar cells on the roof of the new building will help reduce the building’s impact on the environment and reduce the College’s energy bills.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our further education colleges are energetic and dynamic places producing the highly skilled and entrepreneurial people this country needs to create economic growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“However because of past under investment nearly a million learners in England have a substandard experience due to poor estates and facilities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The quality of facilities should match the aspiration of the sector. That’s why over the next two years we are investing £550 million in transforming colleges across the country, providing thousands of students with the state-of-the-art facilities that will help them fulfil their potential.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Association of Colleges’ chief executive, Martin Doel, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These additional funds are most welcome, as Professor Alison Wolf noted in her recent review of vocational education, the provision of facilities and specialist equipment is a key factor in delivering high quality courses and occupational training.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This investment will allow colleges to continue to update their estates helping them to deliver continuing high standards to their students, communities and industry partners.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy includes a number of case studies to help demonstrate the types of projects which could be supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preston College who operated across two sites and were able to consolidate to one by investing in a new building. This increased their commercial income by 40 per cent and achieved £300,000 in running cost and efficiency savings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Northbrook College who received a £1million Government grant towards a £5.1 million project to improve old buildings that were difficult to heat and prone to leaking. This resulted in significant energy savings with a 50 per cent reduction in the first month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The facilities for Hartpury College’s Home Farm Campus were predominantly in temporary buildings. The College received a £1million Government grant for a £3.8 million project to construct the Malcolm Wharton Centre. The new facilities have improved operational efficiency with savings of £80,000 a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day the Adult FE and Skills Funding Statement has been published which details the overall budget available for skills for the next two years and the number of learners Government anticipates this will support.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year’s budget has been set at 2.8 per cent above last year’s which will give stability to colleges and providers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An evaluation of the impact of capital expenditure on FE college outcomes, used to inform the FE College Capital Investment Strategy is being published on the same day as the announcement of the Strategy. The evaluation can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/e/12-1315-evaluation-capital-expenditure-in-further-education-colleges.pdf"&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/e/12-1315-evaluation-capital-expenditure-in-further-education-colleges.pdf](http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/e/12-1315-evaluation-capital-expenditure-in-further-education-colleges.pdf)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Adult FE and Skills Funding can be found from 2pm at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/s/12-p172-skills-funding-statement-2012-2015"&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/further-education-skills/docs/s/12-p172-skills-funding-statement-2012-2015&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colleges can apply for the new capital funding through the Skills Funding Agency.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since May 2010 the Government has made more than £330 million available enabling more than £1 billion college projects.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month the Government announced the funding outcomes of the third phase of the Enhanced Renewal Grant (ERG3) which is investing £110 million, through the Skills Funding Agency. This will be more than matched with £302 million investment from colleges.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Autumn Statement 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Autumn Statement is one of two major statements the Treasury has to give to parliament every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Statement provides an update on the Government’s plans for the economy based on the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. These forecasts are published alongside the Autumn Statement on 5 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From today’s update of the government’s spending plans, the Department for Business has secured £2.4 billion of additional funding to support growth, with a focus on skills and science projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This money reinforces the government’s commitment to plan for medium and long term recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will aid the development of an industrial strategy to shape and rebalance our economy, in partnership with business. This will drive growth, create the jobs of the future and help us get ahead in the global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="main-announcements-for-bis"&gt;Main announcements for BIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional £600 million for science, research and innovation, which takes the total investment since the 2010 spending review to an additional £1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £270 million to be spent on laboratories, classrooms and other facilities in our Further Education colleges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1 billion confirmed for the business bank, which will address the long-term structural gap in lending to small businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £120 million invested in supply chains, to encourage companies to invest here in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Regional Growth Fund will also receive an additional £350 million, bringing the total available in 2012-13 to £2.75 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first stage of the government’s response to Lord Heseltine’s independent review on economic growth, ‘No Stone Unturned’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra money for the Employer Ownership Pilot, taking it to £340 million overall and giving businesses funding so they can design and develop their own training programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased funding of £140 million for UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) to help small and medium sized business export abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1.5 billion to help our smallest companies to access growing markets overseas. For the first time UK Export Finance, the Government’s export credit agency, will be able to issue loans to overseas customers and buyers wanting to purchase goods from UK businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A package of measures to cut back red tape that business has told government stops them from growing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-and-innovation"&gt;Science and Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Spending Review in 2010 the yearly £4.6 billion funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms and ring-fenced during the spending review period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £600 million announced today will be invested in facilities for technological research and development and Research Council infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amounts to an additional £1.5 billion of capital funding for science, research and innovation since the beginning of the Review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment will support the development of innovative technologies and strengthen the UK‘s competitive advantage in areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big data and energy efficient computing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced materials.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details about how the £600 million will be spent will be published in due course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science budget will continue to be protected and ring-fenced for the rest of the Spending Review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Low Pay Commission visit to Blackburn &amp; Preston</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hannett and Professor Steve Machin will meet a number of representatives in Blackburn and Preston to hear first hand what impact the National Minimum Wage is having on businesses and workers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low Pay Commissioner John Hannett said: “Hearing directly from those affected by the National Minimum wage is an important part of the Commission’s work and informs our recommendations to the Government. Our visits take us around the UK and we welcome the opportunity to hear how the National Minimum Wage has affected people in Blackburn and Preston.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commission has produced thirteen reports. These are available from the Stationery Office Bookshops or the Commission’s website at: [](http://www.lowpay.gov.uk3)&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lowpay.gov.uk"&gt;http://www.lowpay.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

    <title>Groceries Adjudicator to have power to fine supermarkets</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition minister Jo Swinson has today announced that the Groceries Code Adjudicator will be given greater powers to enforce the Grorceries Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a change likely to be widely welcomed by suppliers and farmers, the government listened to the concerns from stakeholders to give the Adjudicator more teeth to protect suppliers from unfair treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Adjudicator finds that retailers are breaching the Groceries Code and treating their suppliers unlawfully or unfairly, he or she will be able to apply a range of sanctions. In most cases, this would consist of recommendations or ‘naming and shaming’ but, if the breach is serious enough, the Adjudicator will have an immediate power to fine the retailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adjudicator is being established after the Competition Commission identified competition issues in their 2008 market study. The Adjudicator will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arbitrate disputes between retailers and suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Investigate confidential complaints from direct and indirect suppliers, whether in the UK or overseas, and from third parties.* &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hold to account retailers who break the rules by ‘naming and shaming’ or, if necessary, imposing a fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jo Swinson said, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The food industry plays an important role in economic growth, and the Groceries Code Adjudicator will help to ensure that the market is operating in a fair and healthy way. Large supermarkets form a big chunk of this industry, and generally provide consumers with low prices and variety whilst providing business for farmers and suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But where supermarkets are breaking the rules with suppliers and treating them unfairly, the Adjudicator will make sure that they are held to account. We have heard the views of the stakeholders who were keen to give the Adjudicator a power to fine, and recognise that this change would give the Adjudicator more teeth to enforce the Groceries Code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We expect fines to be used as a last resort, but the fact that the Adjudicator has the power to impose them will send a strong message to retailers that compliance with the Code is not optional. I am confident that these changes will mean that the Adjudicator is able to ensure fair play in the food supply chain and keep the industry growing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Adjudicator will publish guidance within six months after the Bill comes into effect to propose the maximum amount he or she will be able to fine. Retailers would have a full right of appeal against any fines imposed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;hold to account retailers who break the rules by ‘naming and shaming’ or, if necessary, imposing a fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adjudicator is being set up through the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill which is currently passing through Parliament.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Notes to editors  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. The proposed maximum level of fine suggested by the Adjudicator will be established by Order by the Secretary of State, taking into account the Adjudicator’s recommendation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bill and accompanying documents can be viewed on the parliament website at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/groceriescodeadjudicator.html"&gt;http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/groceriescodeadjudicator.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Groceries Code was created by Order of the Competition Commission in the Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) Market Investigation Order 2009. It is legally binding on retailers.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Competition Commission’s report into the Groceries Market from 2008 can be found at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/assets/competitioncommission/docs/pdf/non-inquiry/press_rel/2008/apr/pdf/14-08"&gt;http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/assets/competitioncommission/docs/pdf/non-inquiry/press_rel/2008/apr/pdf/14-08&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Groceries Code applies to the 10 retailers with a turnover in the groceries market in excess of £1bn.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Groceries Code was put in place by the Competition Commission in 2008 and obliges large retailers to: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deal fairly and lawfully with their suppliers;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not vary supply agreements retrospectively, except in circumstances beyond the retailer’s control which are clearly set out in the supply agreement; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pay suppliers within a reasonable time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, the Groceries Code:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limits large retailers’ power to make suppliers change their supply chain procedures;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limits large retailers’ power to make suppliers pay marketing costs and compensation for wastage;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requires large retailers to pay compensation for forecasting errors in certain circumstances;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limits large retailers’ power to make suppliers obtain goods or services from third parties who pay the retailer for that arrangement;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limits large retailers’ power to make suppliers pay them for stocking their products; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limits large retailers’ power to make suppliers pay for promotions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requires large retailers to take due care when ordering for promotions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limits large retailers’ power to make suppliers pay for resolving customer complaints; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limits large retailers’ power to ‘de-list’ suppliers in other words, to stop dealing with a supplier or make significant reductions to the volume of purchases from a supplier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries.’ It set four ambitions in the ‘Plan for &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boost for UK automotive supply chains</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report published in the summer by the Automotive Council found automotive manufacturers already spend £8.4 billion with UK suppliers and actively wish to increase local purchasing. An immediate opportunity was identified to increase local purchasing by £3 billion per annum.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s event at Chelsea Football Club in London has been organised by UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) to inform global companies of the benefits of investing in the UK. It will also explain how Government is committed to growth through its industrial strategy, and the work of the joint Government and industry Automotive Council.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities for automotive supply chain companies to invest in the UK will be highlighted, including the opportunity to be part of a successful and growing UK automotive manufacturing economy. The UK made 1.4 million cars in 2011 and is forecast to make 2 million cars by 2015.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to do all we can to make sure the UK supply chain takes better advantage of business opportunities in the automotive sector, and showing global businesses what the UK has to offer will help make this happen.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will not only secure valuable business deals for UK firms, but further strengthen the success of the UK automotive sector.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-Chair of the Automotive Council, Richard Parry-Jones, said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our major manufacturers have already repatriated hundreds of millions of pounds worth of business to the UK. But there is the potential to win back so much more.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With global vehicle makers investing millions in R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing projects in the UK, there is a real opportunity for more UK suppliers to become global players and to persuade new suppliers to base themselves here.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Government and industry working through the Automotive Council are determined to help them grasp these opportunities in order to strengthen the UK supply base and secure growth and high value manufacturing jobs.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment chief executive Nick Baird said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The resurgence of our car industry is a major British success story. Backed by substantial inward investment, the sector now employs over 700,000 people and accounts for nine per cent of our exports.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Britain strongly welcomes inward investment which is important to enable our manufacturers to produce more components for the UK automotive supply chain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Notes to editors  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. The Automotive Council’s report on supply chain investment potential is available &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.automotivecouncil.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GROWING-THE-UK-AUTOMOTIVE-SUPPLY-CHAIN-Aug-2012.pdf"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Business Secretary urges headhunters to seek out new female talent</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at an event at the London Stock Exchange, hosted by the 30 Per Cent Club, Dr Cable also called on the CEOs of FTSE 350 companies to put firm plans in place to develop talented individuals in their organisations and ensure a healthy pipeline of female executives over the long term.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he revealed that he is writing to every company and public body in which the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) holds an interest with the same request, and will ask Ministerial colleagues to do the same.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The great majority of business leaders I meet with now recognise the economic case for gender balance and are actively working with us to increase the number of women on their boards and executive committees. But we must also challenge the paternalistic culture and silent assumptions about women’s priorities that are ultimately keeping the glass ceiling in place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Headhunters have a crucial role to play in making sure there is a diverse pool of talent for business to choose from. So we are urging them to fish in a bigger pond, to identify new talent and to shine a spotlight on the selection and appointments. I’m delighted that eight executive search firms have today agreed to publish the data they collect on the percentages of men and women longlisted, shortlisted and appointed to executive positions. This will allow businesses to work with search firms that promote and are transparent about this agenda.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government also needs to think about improving the gender balance on our steering committees, in our stakeholder groups and our overseas delegations. I am using every opportunity to drive this message home in my own department and across government and maintain the momentum we’ve seen since Lord Davies published his review 18 months ago.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A progress report published today by Cranfield School of Management shows that women now account for 17.4% of FTSE 100 and 12.0% of FTSE 250 board positions. In the last six months, the percentage of new FTSE 100 appointments going to women has risen to 44.1%, and 36.4% in FTSE 250 companies.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Notes to editors:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. The executive search firms who have so far committed to publish figures on appointments by gender are:  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buying Smarter Together</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;28 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Smarterbuys’ scheme, which helps provide affordable loans to disadvantaged people so that they can buy essential goods, has scooped the £15,000 Buy Better Together Challenge prize, presented by Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge was launched by BIS and Co-operatives UK in December 2011 to encourage groups of consumers to get together and negotiate discounted rates for buying goods and services in bulk. The Challenge received 110 entries, which were whittled down by a panel of independent judges to seven finalists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Fair Food Carlisle’ was awarded the runner-up prize for their scheme which uses buying groups to provide workplaces with a weekly supply of food from local businesses, winning £5,000 which will be invested in improving business processes and hiring staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event Jo Swinson said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;” The Buy Better Together Challenge has highlighted hundreds of fantastic ideas and examples from local communities, who banded together to make their money work harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Collective purchasing is of immense value to groups, not just to make cost savings, but to increase social links in the community and reach out to vulnerable consumers who may not have access to online research or internet shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The schemes we have heard about today aren’t just benefitting consumers though; businesses have seen first-hand how they can gain more customers by working with these groups and communities, often beating competitors in the process. Many congratulations are due to the organisers of ‘Smarterbuys’, which is a positive example of how collective purchasing can challenge existing markets and provide better results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And I also congratulate ‘Fair Food Carlisle’ in supporting local produce growers and taking an innovative approach to boosting their local food economy. These schemes are a clear example of what can be done when consumers are empowered and work together to get better deals.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lord Currie sets out vision for new Competition and Markets Authority</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Law Society’s Competition Section Annual Dinner, Lord Currie set out his vision, and the challenges to be faced over the next year, with the bringing together of the Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission to create the new competition Authority.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Currie said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is a great deal to be managed over the next year or so before the new Authority assumes its powers in April 2014, all in the context of delivering the ongoing case load consistently and effectively, without interruption.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to make sure that the Competition and Markets Authority is established as a vibrant organisation with a fresh, dynamic culture that embodies both new elements and the best of the two legacy bodies and retains and integrates the talent of their staff. And we have the time to get this right.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The combined organisation will be able to deploy resources more effectively and flexibly to the different parts of its work. It will deliver decisions in a more timely way with no diminution of quality, to the benefit of consumers and businesses. It will provide a single, and therefore stronger, voice and advocacy, both at home and internationally, on competition and consumer issues.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Currie outlined his vision for how the CMA will address the issues as part of the Government’s comprehensive competition and consumer landscape reform, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deploying resources more effectively and flexibly to the different parts of its work, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 merger and markets investigations and decisions, adhering to tighter timetables;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using new powers to make antitrust investigations more efficient and fair; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling hardcore cartels more effectively to ensure that markets can be as dynamic and innovative as possible to help achieve the economic growth that the country needs, through the proposed removal of the dishonesty test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Currie was clear that the CMA will play a bigger role in the enforcement of consumer law, working closely with other national organisations such as Trading Standards (through the recently established National Trading Standards Board) and Citizens Advice. Together this will result in effective competition and well-informed and empowered consumers, both making an important contribution to driving growth in the economy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CMA_ _would also work in partnership with and provide leadership to the sector regulators competition and market issues. This would follow a path of enhanced cooperation, led by the new Authority, drawing on the sectoral expertise of the regulators and the competition expertise of the CMA.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Currie confirmed that the process to appoint a Chief Executive to the new Authority was well under way, as were the transition processes for the two legacy bodies, and preparations were on track to begin full operation in April 2014.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Notes for editors  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. Lord Currie was appointed as Chair Designate of the Competition and Markets Authority in July 2012. The CMA will begin operation in April 2014. David Currie will lead the organisational design of the new body and work closely with Government, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the Competition Commission (CC) to ensure a smooth and effective transition. He will establish the CMA’s vision and strategic direction and play a central role in the appointment of its Chief Executive and Board.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government announced its plans for the creation of the CMA in March 2012. It will bring together the Competition Commission with the competition and markets functions of the Office of Fair Trading to become a world-leading unitary authority, advocating competition both at home and abroad.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, currently going through the House of Lords, will create the legal framework to establish the CMA.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is underway across Government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the Government wants the economy to travel.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK business partnership with Kuwait boosted by new deals</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Emir will meet with UK businesses at Lancaster House today to discuss the benefits of UK-Kuwaiti business partnerships. This will be followed by a networking reception for UK businesses to find out more about potential opportunities in Kuwait.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event comes as new commercial deals were signed between UK companies and Kuwait:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A letter of mutual intent for the development of the Kuwaiti Security Programme will be signed. The Kuwaitis will provide an initial investment to FCO Services (a trading fund of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) to fund the first phase of a programme of works to enhance Kuwait’s homeland security. This represents a major opportunity for the UK’s defence and security industries.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Capita Symonds, a leading firm of architects, has just been awarded a multi million pound contract for the design review and construction supervision of a 415 bed expansion programme to the existing Amiri Hospital in Kuwait. The project, which will be undertaken in association with local firm Gulf Consult, is expected to last four years and will require the input of Capita Symonds professional staff over this period in UK and Kuwait.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kuwait Investment Office, which was set up nearly sixty years ago, has announced a long term roadmap for investing in the UK. The decision will allow, for the first time, large scale investment into UK infrastructure projects.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Marland said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The economic relationship between our two countries is flourishing. The Prime Minister visited Kuwait in February 2011, where he stated our intent to double bilateral trade to £4 billion by 2015.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very pleased to say that we are well on the way to doing that, with exports on goods from the UK up 17% for the first 8 months of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011, while the services sector saw a 13% increase in 2011 compared with the previous year. This is a trend we will work extremely hard to sustain over the next few years.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anas al-Saleh, Minister Commerce and Industry, State of Kuwait, said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kuwait is very much open for business. The announcement of both public and private sector commercial deals truly shows Britain’s confidence in Kuwait. Meanwhile, Britain remains one of Kuwait’s most important trading partners, as evidenced by the 60th anniversary of the Kuwaiti Investment Office in London, the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the UK.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The State Visit of His Highness The Emir of Kuwait to the UK has provided the opportunity to maintain and build on the relationships that are at the heart of the close friendship between our two countries. Today’s announcements highlight that our business relationships are just as important as our diplomatic ones, and demonstrate the continued long-term commitment that Kuwait has made to the UK.”  &lt;/p&gt;
