&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; enquiries announcement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; enquiries will close at 12pm on Monday 24 December 2012 and re-open Wednesday 2 January 2013 at 7.30am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Forces Post Office (&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;) provides a mail service to serving British Forces personnel and their families worldwide, including exercises and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; headquarters is based in a purpose built facility at RAF Northolt, in North West London. &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; also has a number of defence mail centres at Andover, Aldershot, Catterick, Colchester, Donnington, Glasgow, Central London, Northolt, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Wyton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; also provides the e-bluey hybrid mail service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bfpo-mobile-app"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Mobile App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bfpo/id567839256"&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; app&lt;/a&gt; is free and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; have wanted to get mail information out quickly and efficiently to their large serving customer base and their families. From those in well known locations like Germany, Brunei and the Falkland Islands, and operational theatres, to the deployed ships of the Royal Navy and the global locations of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting service personnel and their families all over the globe is no easy task. The &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; have had their work cut out to develop the right product. The app was the brainchild of Lieutenant-Colonel Colin Code, who realised there was a real need for this. He was also the wizard behind the design and functionality of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the app can locate all &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers globally - the user simply inserts the country they are posting to. It lists all British retailers who post products to &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; addresses and gives a reminder of dangerous air-cargo restrictions. It will calculate the cost of your parcel once you enter the size, weight and destination and it even gives final mailing deadlines for key annual dates like Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; app, developed by Locassa, is now available at the &lt;a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bfpo/id567839256"&gt;App Store in iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, and on Google play for Android phones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please tell us your suggestions for improvements to the app through &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; enquiries email at &lt;a href="mailto:DESBFPO-Enquiries@mod.uk"&gt;DESBFPO-Enquiries@mod.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bfpo-mission"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; mission&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; is to provide an efficient and effective postal and courier service in order to sustain the fighting power of UK Armed Forces worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-bfpo-philatelic-bureau"&gt;The &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Philatelic Bureau&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for the Forces Philatelic Bureau has been transferred to a new not-for-profit organisation, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bfps.org.uk/" title="British Forces Philatelic Service"&gt;British Forces Philatelic Service (BFPS)&lt;/a&gt;, which has been set up to ensure that our philatelic service survives and thrives. BFPS is a Community Interest Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; retains responsibility for philatelic policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-to-address-bfpo-mail"&gt;How to address &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; mail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that all mail sent through the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; system is addressed correctly to ensure a smooth delivery to the destination address. The following information is provided as a guide to the do’s and don’ts when addressing mail to all &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbered locations, including exercises and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following format when addressing your mail:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="address"&gt;&lt;div class="adr org fn"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Service No Rank Name  
&lt;br&gt;Unit/Regt  
&lt;br&gt;Operation Name (If applicable)  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; No  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="address"&gt;&lt;div class="adr org fn"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

1234567 Pte Joe Bloggs  
&lt;br&gt;1st Battalion  
&lt;br&gt;Operation HERRICK  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; 772  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure you write a return address on the reverse of the mail item. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write the address clearly in capital letters, this will aid in the automatic sortation equipment reading the address first time and speed your mail arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-not-to-address-your-mail"&gt;How not to address your mail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not write any other address details after the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; number on the address, as this can lead to mail being diverted to the wrong &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; location. For example, the following address will lead to the item being redirected to &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; 12, Belize: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="address"&gt;&lt;div class="adr org fn"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

1234567 Pte Joe Bloggs  
&lt;br&gt;1st Battalion  
&lt;br&gt;Operation Telic  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; 641  
&lt;br&gt;Op Telic 12  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automatic sortation equipment will read the last line of the address and direct the item to &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; 12 in Belize. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include destination country in the address - &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers are similar to a UK postcode whereby the sortation software simply reads the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; number and sorts to the appropriate location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; headquarters address for onward transmission to the recipient - Royal Mail sortation software will recognise a &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; address and automatically direct the item to the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; sorting office in North London. The item will then be sent to the Returned Letters Branch, if no return address has been supplied the item will be held for a period of 3 months before being destroyed.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write any other information on the front of the mail item as this can lead to the item not being automatically sorted and will delay the onward trasmission to the required destination  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;send items to unnamed individuals eg ‘to a soldier on the front line’ - the free post service for Op KIPION/Op HERRICK and the yearly Christmas free post service to operations is only available for friends and family of troops serving on operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new UK non-geographic post codes are for on-line use only and are not part of the mail address; and therefore should not be used as part of the normal mail address. All UK mail sorting processes are automated and set to only read &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers; any alteration to the standard address may cause the mail item to be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="look-up-bfpo-numbers"&gt;Look up &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers are seperated into two areas, the first are issued for HM Ships with the second being issued for all other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="static-bfpo-numbers"&gt;Static &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are used for a given location, and/or group of isolated detachments, and will not move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hm-ships"&gt;HM ships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers refer to a specific ship or Naval Party, regardless of their location around the world, although some may refer to land-based naval establishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="find-a-bfpo-number-or-postcode"&gt;Find a &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; number or postcode.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fee payable in addition to postage. Compensation up to a maximum of £46 may be paid where it can be shown that a letter was damaged or lost while in the custody of either Royal Mail or the British Forces Postal Service. Customers are to be advised to obtain a Certificate of Posting, which must be produced in the event of loss, in cases where they feel they would wish to claim if the item was lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available for all Letter Services (Air and Surface Letters, Small Packets and Printed Papers) to UK plus to and from &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbered addresses.

&lt;p&gt;Prices effective from 16 April 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="documentation"&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All HM forces parcels sent by customers who do not have a business contract with Parcelforce Worldwide must bear a fully completed despatch pack PFU5 (or replacement) available from your local Post Office branch. Business Commercial customers will be supplied with relevant documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="e-bluey-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it"&gt;E-bluey: what it is and how to use it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When British Forces are deployed on operations they are entitled to free aerogrammes (colloquially known as “blueys” because of their colour) to and from their families and friends. This service has been in place for a considerable time. Blueys as we know them today were issued for the first time during the early days of the Northern Ireland deployment. More recently &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, working in conjunction with SuperLetter.com, has pioneered an electronic form of the bluey known as ‘e-bluey’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The e-bluey is a Hybrid mail system that allows service personnel, relatives and friends to maintain a personal and private contact with each other while serving on operations or exercise for more than 60 days duration. Probably the most important factor is that the system is two-way. This means those service personnel with access to the Internet can send e-blueys back home.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-e-bluey-works"&gt;How e-bluey works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either compose your message online or offline using a word processor or the Quick Letter Writer. This message is sent to the e-bluey server, where it is stored prior to being down-loaded by the Forces Post Office (&lt;abbr title="Forces Post Office"&gt;FPO&lt;/abbr&gt;) in the appropriate operational theatre, or by &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt and Denfence Mail Centres for e-blueys addressed to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is then printed and sealed before being passed into the local &lt;abbr title="Forces Post Office"&gt;FPO&lt;/abbr&gt;/Royal Mail mailstream. The system is private and personal as the text is only seen by the originator and the recipient, there are two stages of encryption to ensure that the message remains private and personal. The specialist machinery prints and seals it automatically without the e-bluey being seen by the operator. The service is free to the user, although the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; pays a fee for each letter transmitted. The time of transmission of a letter to the adddressee can be dramatically reduced, as it is not necessary to physically transport the letter through the military mail system between theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="who-can-use-e-bluey"&gt;Who can use e-bluey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service Personnel, Relatives and friends of service personnel who are deployed on operations are entitled to use the e-bluey service. Both the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; and e-bluey web-sites have a list of entitled &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; locations that can be reached through the service. Revenue protection measures are implemented from time to time at the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Headquarters in London and by the e-bluey administrator to ensure that the system is being used correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="add-a-photo-to-your-e-bluey"&gt;Add a photo to your e-bluey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo-bluey is a feature within e-bluey that allows you to insert a photo, either colour or black and white, at the top of an e-bluey. The photo to be inserted must be on your computer and can be any size. However the area available on an e-bluey to insert the photo is limited to 185mm wide x 115mm high (7.2 x 4.5 inchs or 700 x 434 pixels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos smaller than this will be printed actual size, whilst photos larger will be automatically reduced proportionally to fit as closely to the 185mm x 115mm area. Please remember that the larger the photo the longer it will take to upload to the e-bluey server, so please be patient when you are uploading large photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="e-bluey-additional-services"&gt;E-bluey: additional services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fax-bluey"&gt;Fax-bluey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fax-bluey is basically the same as an e-bluey, however it allows the sender to send an e-bluey in your own handwriting instead of using a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the fax-bluey service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get a fax-bluey from your Unit Post Orderly, &lt;abbr title="Forces Post Office"&gt;FPO&lt;/abbr&gt; or Hive personnel  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write your letter in the large box starting from the top of the form  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write clearly and in large print the name and address of the person you are writing to in the ‘to’ box at the bottom of the form  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;write your own name and address in the ‘from’ box  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when you have completed your letter, take it to your nearest fax-scanner to be scanned in and sent to the e-bluey server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once loaded onto the server your letter then follows the same procedure as a normal e-bluey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-fax2email"&gt;What is Fax2email?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fax2email is virtually the same as the Fax-bluey, except that in the ‘to’ box you must write clearly and in large print the e-mail address of the person to whom you are writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-pay-bluey"&gt;What is pay-bluey?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay-bluey works in the same format as e-bluey, it is a Hybrid mail system that allows service personnel, relatives and friends to maintain a personal and private contact with each other while serving overseas at British Forces Post Offices that are not covered by the Operational Welfare Package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between each system is that e-bluey is free to use but, as it states in the name, you have to pay for the pay-bluey service. However, please remember you are only able to use the pay-bluey service to a location where an e-bluey system has been installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bfpos-enduring-free-mail-service"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Enduring Free Mail service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Enduring Free Mail service has been authorised for Op HERRICK, Op KIPION and HM Ships in Support. This service will operate until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Families and friends in UK and BFPOs can send packets up to 2kg in weight, free of charge, to service personnel only on Op HERRICK, Op KIPION and HM Ships in Support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packets are limited to 2kg in weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Size limits: Minimum one surface at least 90mm x 140mm.  Maximum length + depth + width = 900mm width greatest single dimension not more than 600mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following items should not be sent (please also check ‘mail prohibitions’):  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sending-commercial-mail-via-bfpo"&gt;Sending commercial mail via &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial mail is mailed items that are sent through the HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; mail system by a UK-based commercial operator in response to an order placed by an authorised individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ordering-goods-through-the-bfpo-commercial-mail-system"&gt;Ordering goods through the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Commercial Mail system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following individuals can use the system:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British Forces personnel  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;entitled civilians  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dependants of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These ‘end customers’ based at a &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; address, can arrange to receive goods via a UK based Commercial Operator, which is categorised by &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; (the Authority) as ‘Commercial Mail’ (Also known as ‘Commercial Receipts’). Family and friends (living in the UK) of the above can also arrange for Commercial Mail to be received by end customers. For example, end customers based at a &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; address, or family and friends (living in the UK), will directly contact a mail order or catalogue company, possibly via the Internet, to place an order for goods for delivery to a &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the list of companies already in direct contract with HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; under the Commercial Mail process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a company has received an order from an Authorised Individual, they can despatch articles of Commercial Mail to End Customers at worldwide &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; locations, via the HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt Commercial Mail (&lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt;) System, by following one of the four following options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies who foresee a potential ‘one off’, or infrequent use of the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; System can either;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. Physically post the article at a Post Office and pay the appropriate (HM Forces) postage rate (note: using either Royal Mail Documentation (CN22/23) or ParcelForce Worldwide PFU 509 Despatch Pack). Payment for this method allows for both the shipment to HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt and the onward shipment to the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, or any extra costs incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Utilise the arrangement &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; has with Parcelforce Worldwide*, named the ‘One Stop Shop’ Process. Under this process, Companies contract directly with ParcelForce Worldwide (see below for contact details), who, in turn,  are in direct &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;. Payment for this method also allows for both the shipment to HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt and the onward shipment to the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, or any extra costs incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*NOTE: Many Companies are already in direct Contract with ParcelForce for collections of goods direct from their premises for addresses in the UK mainland only. This does not allow for the correct documentation or onward shipment (and extra cost) for despatch from HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt to the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; End Customer. We recommend that you speak to your Parcelforce Representative for further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR 
c. Utilise any &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; may have with other Courier Companies who have chosen to be in direct &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;. Under this process, Companies contract directly with the Courier Company on the list who, in turn, is in direct &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;. Payment for this method is made direct to the Courier Company, who are themselves invoiced by &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;. This allows for both the shipment to HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt and the onward shipment to the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, or any extra costs incurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies who foresee potential frequent use of the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; System enter into a &lt;abbr title="Commercial Mail"&gt;CM&lt;/abbr&gt; Contract directly with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Commercial (see below for contact details), for the onward shipment by &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; to the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; End Customer, with prior use of either your Company’s own transport or a carrier of your Company’s choice for the inland journey to deliver articles to HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id="additional-information"&gt;Additional Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All potential users of the HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Commercial Mail System must read the rules on mail prohibitions and restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adhere without exclusion to the weight and size restrictions that apply to Commercial Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that articles outside of these maximum weight and size restrictions will be refused upon entry at the HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Commercial Mail reception desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Purchase Order numbers cannot be accommodated under the electronic Invoicing process that supports the automated &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Commercial Mail System and will therefore not appear on any invoice issued by the Defence Business Service, Liverpool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; will not enter into any compensation arrangements with, or make any direct compensation payments to, any Third Party who use a company that is itself already in direct Commercial Mail Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; to despatch their articles to HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt and beyond, to end &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; addresses overseas. &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s responsibility and authority remains within the Commercial Mail Contract with the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; only. Any arrangement between the Third Party and the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, regarding the despatch of the Third Party’s articles to HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; Northolt and beyond, is entirely the concern of those two parties only. HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; bears no responsibility, authority or commitment in that relationship, as its contractual relationship is with the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; offers a very limited service for items destined for 5000 series &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; numbers, one that does not offer any delivery guarantees or compensation coverage. This is due to the fact that once items have reached HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; for processing, they are then passed to a separate, 3rd party for subsequent processing and distribution, who operate very strict controls on mail volume allocations and types of items allowed. This places the items totally outside of &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s control, therefore no assurance as to final delivery timeframes can be given and &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; does not accept liability for compensation in the event of any item(s) going missing. Should the 3rd party, for whatever reason, refuse to accept any item upon presentation by HQ &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, then the Sender shall be notified by &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; and be responsible for its collection from &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, or, &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; will return the item back to the Sender, at the Sender’s cost (The 3rd party, responsible for onward processing and distribution, may be contacted on 01908 8522222 - Option 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 has been a busy and challenging year for Defence - on operations in Afghanistan, on our many other overseas commitments, and here at home, delivering security for the Olympics and beginning the huge process of Defence Transformation. You should be proud of what you have achieved in the last 12 months - military and civilian personnel working together to protect our security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, 20th Armoured Brigade, 12th Mechanized Brigade, and now 4th Mechanized Brigade, have built on the hard work and sacrifice of their predecessors. This has been another tough year in Helmand province and we should remember, in particular, the members of our Armed Forces who have lost their lives or who have been seriously injured. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten. However, we should be in no doubt about the importance of the mission or the significant progress that we are making with our &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; (International Security Assistance Force) partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; (Afghan National Security Forces) take on ever more responsibility for security, we will be able to make further significant reduction in UK troop numbers in theatre next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, this summer, at short notice, you stepped in to undertake the largest peacetime operation since World War II, helping to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games such a resounding success, and in the process you demonstrated to the British public and visitors from across the world that your reputation for the highest standards of professionalism is well deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our main effort has been on operations, we have also continued the vital task of transforming Defence to ensure that we have the people, equipment and training to maintain our battle-winning edge in the post-Afghanistan security environment. A balanced budget is the foundation upon which this rests and we must continue to ensure that we maintain our budget discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I know that achieving that balanced budget, and in particular reducing the number of military and civilian personnel, has been a painful process for many. I also recognise that there is a need for certainty over the future laydown of the Armed Forces and the structure of DE&amp;amp;S (Defence Equipment and Support). These are both complex tasks, but I will announce the outcomes and provide that certainty as soon as I can next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we undertake this process of transformation, it is important to keep in mind what we are aiming for: the most capable, deployable and best-trained armed forces in the world, supported by a lean, efficient MOD and a procurement operation that delivers the maximum effect for every pound of taxpayers’ money. There is still a long way to go to deliver this, but I want everyone, whether military or civilian, to be proud of what we are achieving in Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to thank you all for the hard work, commitment and professionalism you have shown in 2012. I am proud to lead such a capable team of men and women. To those of you spending Christmas away from home, you will be in our thoughts. For those of you not on operations, I hope you enjoy the Christmas break. Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Right Honourable Philip Hammond MP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Meet more Millies heroes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="judges-special-recognition-award-1---operation-olympics"&gt;Judges’ Special Recognition Award 1 - Operation Olympics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympians Victoria Pendleton and Greg Rutherford presented the first of two Judges’ Special Recognition Awards to the Armed Forces for their contribution to the London 2012 Olympics. At its height, more than 17,500 personnel stepped in when G4S were not able to provide sufficient guards for all the venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone I’ve met has been incredible; individuals who’ve achieved so much. I feel in awe because all I did was ride round in circles on a wooden track with a bike with no brakes and one gear and this is real life. I can’t not be moved and it makes me feel very proud to be British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear the military personnel treasured their experiences. Senior Aircraftwoman Afyah Bubb, an RAF medic who volunteered to be part of the security team at the Olympic Park, saw it as a ‘once-in-a-lifetime opportunity’. She said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were there to do a job but I unexpectedly got the chance to see Ellie Simmonds break some swimming records which was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Brian Fahy added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were really proud to be part of the Games this summer and see the superb performance of our athletes. Who wouldn’t want to be part of the greatest show in town?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympic long jump gold medallist Greg Rutherford said backstage: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m hugely proud of the Armed Forces; the whole evening has been a massive highlight and getting involved feels out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anne Brannagan and members of the Headley Court Complex Trauma Team" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5637/award_for_headley_court.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Anne Brannagan and members of the Headley Court Complex Trauma Team with their Special Recognition Award [Picture: The Sun newspaper]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a light-hearted moment, Greg joked that he hadn’t packed enough tissues. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I get emotional so easily and seeing videos of these incredible people moves me to tears every time. It’s completely surreal to be here; I’ve got friends in the Armed Forces including my best friend who is now going through training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s fantastic to be invited to such a prestigious night, and to show our respect and thanks to these guys is an honour. The troops came in with happy smiley faces and gave high fives and absolutely saved the day! A huge thank you, you were absolutely spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="judges-special-recognition-award-2---complex-trauma-team-headley-court"&gt;Judges’ Special Recognition Award 2 - Complex Trauma Team, Headley Court&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Judges’ Special Recognition Award honoured the Complex Trauma Team at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Militarymedicine/Pages/HeadleyCourt.aspx" title="Headley Court"&gt;Headley Court&lt;/a&gt;. It is the remarkable skill and dedication of the 110-strong Trauma Team that help many critically wounded soldiers overcome life-changing injuries so they can get back to leading active lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex trauma manager Anne Brannagan received the award on behalf of Headley Court from actor Kevin Spacey who congratulated and shook hands with each of the 10 team members on stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Captain Clare Walton, Commanding Officer at Headley Court, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kevin Spacey was just very complimentary, it was great, and to have someone of his level of superstardom even know who we are is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/4685336/the-sun-military-awards-2012-roll-of-honour.html" title="Sun Military Awards roll of honour"&gt;The Millies&lt;/a&gt; awards ceremony tonight (14 December) on ITV1 at 2100hrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Living through the guilt of surviving</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rifle muzzle protruded from his chest, piercing just millimetres above the main artery going into his heart, his radio had gone through his arm, and the explosion had fired shrapnel, gravel and metal the length of his back to the soles of his feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His legs burned from the fierce heat of the metal fragments piercing his skin, his trousers were all but gone - shredded in the blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his own injuries, he tried to help carry the other wounded from the ensuing fire fight, instinctively pulling the rifle muzzle from his chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years on and Guardsman Pearson’s body remains scarred, with shrapnel still coming out of his skin every day. The hidden mental scars, however, have damaged him more than any physical injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Torturing myself’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having had both types of injuries, physical and mental, the physical side of it was far easier to get over,” said the 21-year-old Grenadier Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mental side of it, well it’s just taking so long to get over. You finally think you are there and then one little thing happens and it all comes back down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="British soldiers carrying a simulated casualty during an exercise in Wales (stock image)" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5618/Living_through_the_guilt_of_surviving_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;British soldiers carrying a simulated casualty during an exercise in Wales (stock image) [Picture: Corporal Paul Morrison, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest thing to deal with has been the reaction of people he had considered friends - their ignorance of post-traumatic stress disorder leading them to think he was faking flashbacks, nightmares and crippling insomnia to get out of soldiering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The things people have said about me since admitting my post-traumatic stress are, to be fair, what I would have thought about anyone else too… before it happened to me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone says just man up, and that’s what I had been doing for so long, but it came to a point where I couldn’t man up any more. I had to go get help to get through it because it was only going to get worse, not better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was short-tempered and angry, drinking too much and arguing, and I was having difficulty sleeping. I was getting paranoid about sleeping in the same room as the other blokes in case they took the mick out of me for screaming in the night from the nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was torturing myself with ‘what ifs’, and if that had happened what would have come out of it. But I still thought there was nothing wrong with me, that it was everyone else and they just hadn’t adapted to me coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My now wife, Loren, begged me to realise what I was doing, and how hard I was making other people’s lives with my arguing. It would be over the stupidest little things. But I thought it was everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk through the explosion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turning point came when Guardsman Pearson reacted badly to a joke made at a family wedding, and Loren’s father took him outside for a little chat, warning him that if he continued he would lose Loren and destroy everything he had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I went to the med centre as soon as I got back to work,” he said. “I didn’t want to hurt anyone, and I was starting to worry about how much of a hold I had over myself during the flashbacks and the drinking. I didn’t know what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after reporting to the medical centre, Guardsman Pearson was referred to the Department of Community Mental Health in Woolwich for assessment and then psychotherapy, and was encouraged to talk through the explosion in Nad ‘Ali - breaking it down into little bits to look at each action from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this he could slowly see that he had done nothing wrong, and that nothing he could have done would have saved his friend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I first went to the sessions my intention was just to forget everything, I didn’t want to relive it,” he said. “I wanted everything out of my mind so I could finally get a decent night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We tried things like the breathing techniques to deal with my anger, but it just didn’t work with me - it’s easier said than done to sit there and think of a happy place when all you want to do is be angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But breaking things down and looking at it from different ways did make me feel better as I could see I did what any normal soldier would have done in the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More good days than bad days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time. There is no quick fix. It’s been nearly two years for me now, and it’s a constant cycle of good and bad days. It feels like you are stuck and you can’t go that little bit further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Initially though it was like a roundabout - sometimes I would go to the therapist and there would be absolutely nothing wrong and it would all be fine, and then a week later I would go back and there would be loads I needed to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now the memories only tend to come back on days like Remembrance Sunday, whereas before it was every night and I would remember that little bit more than I did the night before - so it would play on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I still have my good days and my bad days, but now it’s more good days than bad days. And when my mood swings Loren will tell me to stop me going into them so much. She knows the signs when I am starting to go downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest thing for me is being back at work though - it keeps you busy and your mind off other things. I just hope others will be able to make the most of my experiences to go and seek help, and this campaign [Don’t Bottle It Up] will change the way people think about mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Light Dragoons step up mentoring in Helmand</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boasting a proud recent history as a distinguished reconnaissance regiment, the Light Dragoons have trained diligently for another tour on the outer extremes of Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working remotely has become a reality for elements of the Norfolk-based unit on Op HERRICK 16, others have seen their job description change significantly after less than two months in theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having deployed to southern Afghanistan in a formation reconnaissance role, personnel from A Squadron are now playing their part in the continuing transition effort after accepting a new tasking within the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the move and how they are preparing for the challenge that lies ahead, on the eve of their training in Camp Bastion Lieutenant Jamie Harle said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was very much last minute but we are eager for it. I deployed on my last HERRICK in 2006 and that was all kinetic, but anyone thinking this tour would be the same is misguided. This is all about transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Afghans we have spoken to are really proud of what they are doing; they want to return security to their family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were undertaking screening tasks in the desert, identifying areas of population and routes, while providing a visible deterrent. It was very successful but the main effort has switched for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are now focusing on expanding the mentoring side so the locals can look after these routes and population centres themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Op HERRICK 16 is the third Afghan deployment for Corporal Scott Mallen and the junior non-commissioned officer thinks the timescale for transition is achievable after witnessing the progress that has already been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Life on the ground for soldiers of the Light Dragoons is very different to previous tours " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5616/Light_Dragoons_step_up_mentoring_in_Helmand_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Life on the ground for soldiers of the Light Dragoons is very different to previous tours [Picture: Graeme Main, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the situation on the ground changing, he believes A Squadron can add to the success in its new role training the Afghan Police:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From what I have seen everything is shaping up for the handover,” he said. “It has quietened down in terms of kinetic activity and that is one of the main reasons why forward reconnaissance is coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day the Afghans want a better life. The country’s army is up and running and the ANP [Afghan National Police] are now manning checkpoints in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Op HERRICK 5 it was really kicking off and we were the Brigade Reconnaissance Force on Op HERRICK 10. That was lethal and everyone had a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fact it is now quieter shows we are doing a job out here. The ANP are performing their role and they are not afraid to have a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these soldiers are relishing the opportunity of testing themselves in a new environment, the remainder of the squadron will continue with their formation reconnaissance day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief has seen them providing overwatch for ground forces, pushing forward on scouting missions and playing a key role in identifying enemy positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers of 3rd Troop at Forward Operating Base Ouellette have discovered that life on the ground is very different to previous tours:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was here on Op HERRICK 10 and it was kinetic every day, but now it is quieter and the enemy are on the back foot,” explained Trooper Neil Nutton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Babaji was a Taliban stronghold; we took that and I think it has broken them. We are getting tighter and tighter on them and all they can do is ‘shoot and scoot’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating in Helmand province has become a family affair for the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His brother Trooper Anthony Nutton is serving with B Squadron of the Light Dragoons as part of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force, while older sibling Rifleman John Nutton, 2nd Battalion The Rifles, deployed on Op HERRICK 15:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I met John in Camp Bastion and he said hardly anything happened during his tour. He only had a few contacts and did a lot of patrolling with the ANP, “ said Trooper Neil Hutton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I thought that couldn’t be right, but I believe it now, it has been quiet. In the formation reconnaissance squadron our main role is to go out and see what the enemy are doing, to see where they are and where the IEDs may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can do that for a couple of weeks if needed - it is about building the picture and getting information ahead of any operations. We are the eyes and ears of the battle group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as taking the fight to the enemy, the tour has reaffirmed the positive role being played by the Army within Afghan communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attached medic Lance Corporal Lee Robson, Royal Army Medical Corps, was delighted to report that he has seen a distinct lack of British casualties in the area thus far, meaning his attention has been focused elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have been hands-on with the locals, treating children and adults for minor ailments through to serious injuries such as broken ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a medic it is always nice to offer help to anyone, especially if they have no healthcare system of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It all goes back to the hearts and minds mantra. We are showing them that we are not a force to be frightened of - we are here to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers from A Squadron have again proved how the British Army is producing personnel that can adapt to a variety of roles in the heat of Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with transition set for 2014, the efforts of these troops over the coming months will go a long way to ensuring this ambition becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MOD Police launch Defence Road Safety Week Road Show</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Defence Road Safety Week a Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) Road Show will take a mobile police station to different MOD establishments under the banner of its Home Front Community Safety Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative supports National Road Safety Week, promoted by Brake, the road safety charity, and both events run from Monday 21 November to Sunday 27 November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDP Community Safety Manager for the North East, Sergeant Gavin Alcroft, who is managing the initiative for the MDP, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This will be the sixth year we have carried out a national road show event. We provide information on road safety but we also have equipment on board that allows us to carry out interactive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We show high impact road safety films and we encourage visitors to take a Highway Code quiz with the chance to win a goody bag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national theme of Road Safety Week 2011 is ‘Too Young to Die’ and it focuses on the fact that road crashes are sudden, violent events that can rip families apart by ending lives too soon and causing life-changing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those affected are young and these casualties send shock waves through families and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDP Community Safety Manager for Scotland, Sergeant George Smart, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These casualties are preventable as they are often caused by factors such as driving too fast, overtaking dangerously, driving while using a mobile, driving whilst over the limit, drug driving, driving when tired or failing to use a seat belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest official figures show that there were 1,850 road casualties in the UK overall in 2010 - a reduction of 17 per cent on 2009. Within the MOD, road casualty trends and statistics are down too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="PC Colin Everett helps get the road safety message across at RAF Wittering" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5612/MOD_Police_launch_Defence_Road_Safety_Week_Road_Show_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;PC Colin Everett helps get the road safety message across at RAF Wittering [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, 37 military personnel were killed in on and off duty road traffic incidents. The statistics show that Armed Services personnel are twice as likely to be killed in a road traffic incident as their civilian counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Moate, of the Defence Road Safety Team, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the first six months of 2011, six out of the ten MOD fatalities recorded were of personnel riding motorcycles. These statistics cover any MOD employee killed as a result of a road traffic accident, irrespective of circumstance, and include passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything that we can do to help lower this figure through extra training and workshops, using the support of local authorities and the police, is time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MDP have Community Police Officers and Community Safety Officers stationed across the country who can be contacted for information on road safety activities and initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We need to remain focused on raising awareness of road safety and promoting safer driving across the Defence Estate,” said Sergeant Alcroft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are keen to target attitudes to driving and road use - on and off duty - for military personnel, particularly the younger element, as well as raising awareness in Service families of those important safety messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the national theme is important, we are also mindful of local issues and problems. Where these are identified, they are targeted by our local officers, so please approach them if you have concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road show is scheduled to carry out visits to the Defence Munitions centres at Beith and Longtown, MOD St Athan, the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and HM Naval Base Clyde - covering defence communities in Scotland, England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Lost WWII RAF crew laid to rest in Malaysia</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberator KL654, with its crew of eight from 356 Squadron, left the Cocos Islands on 23 August 1945 to drop supplies into central Malaysia. No message, or signal, was received from the aircraft after take-off and it failed to return from its mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports at the time spoke of an unidentified aircraft being heard over the target area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the aircraft’s route took it over the sea and Sumatran jungle and poor weather conditions were reported, with low cloud over the hills and localised thunderstorms, the aircraft was believed to have crashed in the sea or jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;46 years later in 1991 the wreckage was discovered by the indigenous Orang Asli people in the jungle of Kuala Pilah. Following subsequent numerous expeditions to the crash site by military and non-military teams, a privately-funded expedition in 2009 unearthed the remains of the fallen servicemen which have now finally been laid to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Consolidated Liberator B Mark VI of 356 Squadron landing on three engines at Brown's West Island in the Cocos Islands after completing a sortie on 6 August 1945" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5609/Lost_WWII_RAF_crew_laid_to_rest_in_Malaysia_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an important occasion for the families of the crew of KL654 and also for all of us as we reflect and honour the ultimate sacrifice made by these men for their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am pleased that so many family members of the fallen were able to make the trip to Malaysia to witness their burial and say their final goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the families who had made the 13,000-mile (20,900km) round trip looked on, members of the Queen’s Colour Squadron bore the single coffin carrying the remains of the crew to their final resting place on a hillside overlooking the city of Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew were: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilot - Flight Lieutenant John Selwyn Watts&lt;br&gt;
Co-pilot - Flying Officer Edward Donald Mason&lt;br&gt;
Navigator - Flying Officer William Kenneth Dovey&lt;br&gt;
Air Bomber - Flying Officer John Trevor Bromfield&lt;br&gt;
Wireless Operator/Air Gunner - Flight Sergeant Arthur Turner&lt;br&gt;
Flight Engineer - Flight Sergeant Jack Blakey&lt;br&gt;
Wireless Operator/Air Gunner - Flight Sergeant Raymond Arthur Towell&lt;br&gt;
Air Gunner - Flight Sergeant William Ross&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of the family members the day was about closure and bringing to an end the uncertainty of knowing how their loved ones died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynn Thornhill, daughter of co-pilot Flying Officer Mason, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My mother never really wanted to talk to me about my father, so I grew up not knowing much about him. Finding out how he died and finally being able to lay him to rest has provided some form of closure for me and my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Ken Taylor Royal Navy, the Defence Adviser at the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is indeed a very moving and emotional occasion, not just for the families of the servicemen who lost their lives for their country, but I suspect for British people everywhere, including those living here in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These fallen servicemen will now receive the military honours they deserve and their families will have the closure they seek. We are thankful to those who have made this possible, both from the UK and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral. It can be amphibole asbestos which includes crocidolite (blue) and amosite (brown) asbestos, or serpentine asbestos which is chrysotile (white) asbestos. These are the three main types used in Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to amphibole asbestos poses a greater health hazard than exposure to chrysotile, but all types can cause asbestos-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Duty to Manage Asbestos in Non-Domestic Premises’ introduced in the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 (CAWR) and re-enacted in Regulation 4 of the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 requires all establishments to have in place a suitable Asbestos Management Plan. The Practitioner Guide provides guidance on the requirements and procedures for managing the asbestos risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="control-of-legionella"&gt;Control of Legionella&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by organisms found in water. It is the most well-known and serious form of a group of diseases known as Legionellosis. Legionellosis is the term used for infections caused by legionella pneumophila and other similar bacteria. Infection is caused by inhaling fine air borne water droplets or particles containing the viable bacteria; the disease cannot be passed from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint Service Publication (JSP) 375 Volume 2, Leaflet 19 Control of Legionella (including hot &amp;amp; cold water systems and cooling towers)provides guidance for all parts of the MOD Estate involving a work activity and or premises where water is used or stored and where there is a means of creating and transmitting water droplets, and thereby causing a reasonably foreseeable risk of Legionellosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 (&lt;abbr title="Construction (Design and Management)"&gt;CDM&lt;/abbr&gt; 2007) 
Came into force on the 6th April 2007, the aim of the regulations is to integrate health and safety into the management of a project and to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, target effort where it can do most good in terms of health and safety and ensure risks are managed at the appropriate level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practitioners Guide 03/08 is aimed at those persons within &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/abbr&gt; who are responsible for carrying out duties under the regulations, in particular those who give advice and those who are involved in the selection and appointment process. It provide guidance on how the regulations are to be complied with and implemented within the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/abbr&gt; and should be read in conjunction with the Health and Safety Executive’s (HSE) Approved Code of Practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSP 375 Vol 2 leaflet 20 provides guidance for those persons within &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/abbr&gt; who are responsible for carrying out duties under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 and on how the regulations are to be complied with and implemented within the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="safe-systems--safety-rules-and-procedures"&gt;Safe Systems – Safety Rules and Procedures.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSP 375 Volume 3 contains &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/abbr&gt;’s safe systems of work for its significant risk activities. It’s implementation on the defence estate is mandatory. The purpose of Volume 3 is to enable the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/abbr&gt; to effectively manage its significant risk activities in a cohesive and consistent manner and ensure compliance with UK legislation and contains detailed rules and procedures that are compiled and maintained on behalf of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MoD&lt;/abbr&gt; by Defence Estates. Volume 3 is specifically intended to aid duty holders in discharging their responsibility for ensuring competent persons are in place and ensure a consistent approach through implementation of Chapters 3 to 7 inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of a major casualty incident involving members of the Armed Forces and/or civilian personnel deployed on operations, the &lt;abbr title="Joint casualty and compassionate centre"&gt;JCCC&lt;/abbr&gt; will activate a Major Incident Centre, manned initially by Service Personnel &amp;amp; Veterans Agency (&lt;abbr title="Service Personnel &amp;amp; Veterans Agency"&gt;SPVA&lt;/abbr&gt;) personnel and subsequently reinforced, if necessary, by Service personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activation will be notified by IMMEDIATE signal and when operational, a ‘Lo-Call 0845’ telephone number will be publicised for families and relatives to make enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that in the early phases of a major incident information will be limited and the &lt;abbr title="Joint casualty and compassionate centre"&gt;JCCC&lt;/abbr&gt; will be concentrating its efforts on informing Emergency Contacts/Next of Kin about those who may have been injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="contact-details"&gt;Contact details&lt;/h3&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dr-liam-fox-responds-to-defence-committee-report-on-sdsr"/>
    <title>Dr Liam Fox responds to Defence Committee report on SDSR</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since January, the House of Commons Defence Committee (HCDC) has been reviewing the SDSR and the NSS. It has taken oral evidence from sources including the Defence Secretary, the Armed Forces Minister, the Single Service Chiefs, the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, the Chief of Defence Materiel, the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel), and Lord Stirrup (Chief of the Defence Staff when the SDSR was published). The Department has also provided extensive written evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCDC says the report seeks to establish whether the new National Security Council has led to a more coherent and well-defined security policy in terms of the NSS and the SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its report, the HCDC agrees with the logic underpinning the SDSR, including the prioritisation of operational requirements for Afghanistan, the adaptable posture, the validity of Future Force 2020, and the strategic priority and national security imperative of dealing with the budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the HCDC also says that it is not convinced that, given the current financial climate and the drawdown of capabilities arising from the SDSR, UK Armed Forces will be able do what is asked of them after 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chair of the Committee, the Right Honourable James Arbuthnot MP, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government appears to believe that the UK can maintain its influence while reducing spending in Defence and at the Foreign Office. We do not agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Royal Marines from J Company, 42 Commando, on a routine patrol around Chah-e Anjir in northern Nad 'Ali, Helmand province, southern Afghanistan" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5603/Liam_Fox_responds_to_Defence_Committee_report_on_SDSR_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Royal Marines from J Company, 42 Commando, on a routine patrol around Chah-e Anjir in northern Nad 'Ali, Helmand province, southern Afghanistan [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Dave Hillhouse, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also expresses concerns over the realisation of what is called ‘Future Force 2020’ - the Government’s intended shape of the Armed Forces from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Arbuthnot said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Decisions for post-2015 funding will have to be made in the very near future to ensure progress towards Future Force 2020. If the ambition of a real-terms funding increase is not realised, we will have failed our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Defence Review had not been conducted for 12 years, resulting in an equipment programme that was woefully unaffordable. A multi-billion pound deficit was plaguing Defence, and tough, but necessary, decisions had to be taken. As the Committee rightly acknowledges, dealing with the deficit was a national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Committee is also right to say that Future Force 2020 is only achievable with extra funding. That is why I announced two weeks ago that the military equipment budget will rise in real terms by over £3bn between 2015 and 2020, with new helicopters being ordered, new money for our armoured vehicles, the carrier programme, and guaranteed spending on the Joint Strike Fighter. Our future equipment programme is no longer an unfunded aspiration, but one that provides real money for real equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We continue to have the fourth largest military budget in the world and the SDSR has put Defence back on a stable footing with highly capable Armed Forces and certainty for our personnel and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am pushing through radical reforms to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we have seen in the US, no country is immune to the global financial problems, and even the world’s biggest military power is now grappling with how to make defence cuts and reform for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The SDSR was based on an assessment of the threats we face now and in the future. We have had to take some tough decisions, but as we move towards Future Force 2020 we will remain a formidable fighting force on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will remain capable of sustaining our operations in Afghanistan and Libya before rebalancing will give us the flexibility to maintain our ability to project power across our spheres of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are continually working with our international allies to share operational requirements, including utilising basing and overflight rights for Libya - measures we rightly assessed in the SDSR could be relied upon to mitigate capability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD will respond formally to the Defence Committee regarding today’s report in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
