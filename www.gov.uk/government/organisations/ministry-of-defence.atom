    <title>Princess Royal attends naval cadets' passing out parade</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/thecurrentroyalfamily/theprincessroyal/theprincessroyal.aspx" title="The Princess Royal"&gt;The Princess Royal&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, was the guest of honour at &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s final passing-out-parade of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rain eased off, and with the Royal Marines band playing festive tunes, the Princess Royal was invited to inspect the cadets and take the salute during the march past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parade signified the end of 30 weeks intensive training for the 67 Officer Cadets who can now enjoy Christmas with their families before embarking on the next stage of their Royal Navy careers. Among those passing-out were cadets from 10 overseas nations, who regularly send their personnel to &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt; for training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commanding Officer of &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt;, Captain Jerry Kyd, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were very honoured to have Her Royal Highness visit us for our final parade of the year. These Cadets have been given a thorough induction into the Royal Navy and worked hard to earn their place on the parade ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Princess Royal chats to cadets" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5796/DSC_0146.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They spent the last nine weeks of their training at sea. Some were assigned to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Assault-Ships/HMS-Illustrious" title="HMS Illustrious"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Illustrious&lt;/a&gt;, while others were on board the fleet flagship, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/the-fleet/ships/assault-ships/hms-bulwark" title="HMS Bulwark"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;. Both warships were involved in the Royal Navy’s Cougar 12 deployment working as part of the UK’s Response Force Task Group, exercising with a multitude of other nations in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was an excellent opportunity for the cadets to see at first hand the Royal Navy in operation, working in partnership with our allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Princess Royal has a long association with the Royal Navy. She holds the rank of Rear Admiral as Chief Commandant for Women in the Royal Navy and has special relationships with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Trafalgar-Class/HMS-Talent" title="HMS Talent"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Talent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Assault-Ships/HMS-Albion" title="HMS Albion"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Albion&lt;/a&gt;. The Princess Royal is also Commodore-in-Chief for Portsmouth and last attended a parade at &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt; in 2002, when she represented Her Majesty The Queen at Lord High Admiral’s Divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total 237 &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt; staff and cadets at varying stages of their training were on parade with music provided by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/band_ply.htm" title="The Band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines Plymouth"&gt;Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of leave, the College will re-open in January 2013 for what will be the 150th year of Royal Navy officer training in Dartmouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>MOD launches new Skynet satellite</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra lines of communication will benefit personnel deployed in Afghanistan and other parts of the world, including the Falklands, Cyprus and on ships at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; pictures show the moment that Skynet 5D was launched from French Guiana, South America. It is the fourth satellite of the Skynet 5 project to be put into space since 2007 under a £4bn Private Finance Initiative (&lt;abbr title="Private Finance Initiative"&gt;PFI&lt;/abbr&gt;) programme with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.astrium.eads.net/" title="Astrium website"&gt;Astrium&lt;/a&gt;, who built the satellite and service providers &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.astriumservices.com/" title="Astrium Services"&gt;Astrium Services&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skynet project sustains approximately 800 jobs between the company’s sites in Stevenage, Portsmouth and Corsham, Wiltshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in space, Skynet 5D will travel at speeds of around 10,000 kilometres per hour and is expected to cover around 1.2 billion kilometres during its time in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Skynet 5D satellite is launched from French Guiana" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5790/Decollage_Toucan_010.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Skynet 5D satellite is launched from French Guiana in South America [Picture: S Martin. © ESA-CNES-ARIANESPACE / Optique vidéo du CSG]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonel Mike Griffiths, Head of Networks for the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-equipment-and-support" title="Defence Equipment and Support page on GOV.UK"&gt;Defence Equipment and Support&lt;/a&gt; organisation, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Skynet programme provides vital support to the Armed Forces. The launch of this latest satellite will deliver additional global communications capacity to support our operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/philip-hammond" title="Read about Defence Secretary Philip Hammond"&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The launch of Skynet 5D marks another milestone in this very successful programme. These satellites provide essential secure communication channels for our Armed Forces in Afghanistan and allow all three Services to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of the satellites, Skynet 5A, was launched in March 2007, followed by Skynet 5B in November 2007, and Skynet 5C in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/the-armed-forces-covenant"/>
    <title>The Armed Forces Covenant</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-armed-forces-covenant"&gt;What is the Armed Forces Covenant?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covenant sets out the relationship between the nation, the State and the Armed Forces. It recognises that the whole nation has a moral obligation to members of the Armed Forces and their families and it establishes how they should expect to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It exists to redress the disadvantages that the Armed Forces community faces in comparison to other citizens, and to recognise sacrifices made. In some cases this will require special consideration, especially for those who have given the most, such as the injured and the bereaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Armed Forces Covenant was published in May 2011 the government and our partner charities and voluntary organisations have been very busy. We’ve delivered on a number of commitments, introduced the Community Covenant (with a £30m grant scheme to support it) and produced the first statutory annual report on our progress and where disadvantages remain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle behind the Covenant is that the Armed Forces community should not face disadvantage because of its military experience. In some cases, such as the sick, injured or bereaved, this means giving special consideration to enable access to public or commercial services that civilians wouldn’t receive. The Covenant covers issues from housing and education to support after Service. It is crucial to the government that it, and the nation, recognise the unique and immense sacrifices the Armed Forces community makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="minister-responsible-for-the-covenant"&gt;Minister responsible for the Covenant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces Covenant is a matter for the whole of government and therefore the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister agreed to establish a new ministerial committee. This is led by the Minister for Government Policy, Oliver Letwin, to oversee the Covenant Programme of work and ensure that momentum is maintained, working closely with the Covenant Reference Group. The first meeting was on 2 February 2012 and was chaired by the Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-covenant-achievements"&gt;Key Covenant achievements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using £35 million from fines levied on the banks for attempting to manipulate the LIBOR interest rate on supporting the Armed Forces community, mainly through service charities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twice doubling Council Tax Relief which now stands at nearly £600 per service person for a six-month deployment &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doubling the Families Welfare Grant &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching the Community Covenant scheme &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A £30m Community Covenant grant for local projects that support the scheme &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing the Pupil Premium for service children to £300 from April 2013 and extending it to children of service personnel who have died in service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An additional fund of £3m per year to support state schools catering for significant numbers of service children including children of reservists &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching a Defence Discount Service offering a privilege card entitling members of the Armed Forces community to a range of discounts on goods and services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully disregarding War Pension or other guaranteed income payments through the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme when calculating benefits under Universal Credit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A guarantee that veterans suffering serious genital injuries receive three cycles of IVF &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with banks and building societies on how they lend to members of the Armed Forces &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A ministerially-chaired meeting with key stakeholders to explore ways to improve access to housing &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching a Troops to Teachers scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="commitments-delivered---more-detail"&gt;Commitments delivered - more detail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="healthcare"&gt;Healthcare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are investing up to £15 million in prosthetics provision for personnel who have lost limbs during service. The funding will support commissioning specialist prosthetic and rehabilitation services for amputee veterans through a number of multi-disciplinary centres in England.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We endorsed proposals for improvements in mental health care provision, most of which have been implemented already. These include an extension of access to mental health care to six months after discharge, an increase in the number of veterans’ mental health nurses, a 24-hour helpline and a support and advice website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is ongoing work to gain professional recognition for military medical qualifications, in particular for combat medical technicians and medical assistants. The next stage is to clarify the requirement, which will need to reflect the different environments of each service.
*An e-learning package has been delivered to educate GPs in how best to support veterans’ healthcare needs. This includes raising awareness of the reservists mental health programme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="education"&gt;Education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have delivered a scheme to provide scholarships to bereaved Service children. As of October 2011 a total of 22 Further Education and 61 Higher Education scholarships have been awarded for academic years 2010/2011 and 2011/12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have delivered more help for those leaving the service to go on to higher / further education – not least through payment of tuition fees, which has been extended to the spouses or partners taking up the entitlement because of bereavement or extreme injury of a discharged service person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have introduced the Pupil Premium for the children of those currently serving (£200 per child), amounting to £9m for 2011/12 (for 2012/13 this will be increased to £250, meaning service children will benefit from around an extra £11 million). In addition, we have made available £3m per year for state schools with service children (including those of reservists). Since the launch of this fund, 139 bids from schools have been approved, amounting to £2.9m for this financial year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schools can now exceed the 30-pupil limit for infant classes in order to accommodate service children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A service child indicator is now part of the Annual School Census in England and DFE is now able to identify separately the children of parents in the Armed Forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="housing"&gt;Housing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In England members of the Armed Forces are being placed at the top of the priority list for the government’s £500 million FirstBuy scheme, which is designed to help first time buyers; and at the top of the priority list for all other government-funded home ownership schemes. The first FirstBuy purchase by a Service person has now taken place. This priority lasts for up to 12 months after active service ends. In the event of a death in service the priority passes to the bereaved spouse or civil partner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our support to the Armed Forces Home Ownership Scheme continues: the pilot AFHOS scheme was a huge success in the first of its agreed 4 years of operation, with the agreed funding being used in full.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Service personnel are now able to apply for Service Families Accommodation online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="pay-and-benefits"&gt;Pay and benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are continuing to provide a minimum £250 increase for the lowest ranks in the Armed Forces during the two-year public sector pay freeze.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Council Tax Relief has been doubled twice by government and now stands at nearly £600 per service person for a six-month deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="deployment"&gt;Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have doubled the Families Welfare Grant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We improved Rest and Recuperation leave for those on operations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We doubled the tax free Operational Allowance so that those serving on eligible operations now receive a lump sum of just over £5,000 for a six month tour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="support-after-service"&gt;Support After Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous automatic entitlement to Blue Badges is in place for seriously injured service personnel and veterans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The SPVA has launched a new charity portal for veterans with a link to a dedicated full page of information on each organisation, including services provided and details of how to contact them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="commercial-products"&gt;Commercial products&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are working with credit reference agencies to ensure service people are not disadvantaged by mobility requirements in accessing credit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background-to-the-covenant"&gt;Background to the Covenant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of a mutual obligation between the nation and its Armed Forces goes back centuries – a 1593 statute of Elizabeth I called for a weekly tax so that disabled army veterans: “should at their return be relieved and rewarded to the end that they may reap the fruit of their good deservings, and others may be encouraged to perform the like endeavours”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not until 2000 that the phrase ‘Military Covenant’ was first used, in a publication that details the moral basis for what the Army does. It explains how ‘unlimited liability’ makes soldiering a unique activity and it clarifies what soldiers should expect in return for forfeiting some of their civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Coalition Government came into office in 2010 it made a commitment to rebuild the Covenant. The Covenant was re-named the Armed Forces Covenant to include all three services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covenant covers issues from housing and education to support after service and in it veterans have great importance. It is crucial to the government that it, and the nation, recognises the unique and immense sacrifices you has been made for our country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Future Reserves 2020 Consultation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom’s Reserve Forces are a vital component of our Armed Forces; contributing to the public good we call Defence. They have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the Nation’s defence and security. But the security challenges the UK will face in future are different from those of the past, and for which our Reserve Forces are currently structured. Over the next decade, as Defence transforms to meet future and uncertain challenges, so the importance of our Reserve Forces will increase, and the way we organise and use them will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation exercise will consider what changes are required to the Reserve Forces in order to generate and sustain the numbers and capabilities we need from them to meet our defence requirements. Specifically, we will look to define the right offer to attract and retain the individuals we need to serve in the reserves; the right relationship with the civilian employers of reservists; and the right support for reservists and their families across our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consultation (Green) Paper sets out our thinking and direction of travel on Future Reserve. The key areas on which the paper focuses include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we will use Reserve Forces in the future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The offer for employers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The offer for reservists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses to the Green Paper can be provided online from early November. We encourage you to engage and provide feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A White Paper in 2013 will detail the policy changes for Reserves and show how changes will be implemented to establish a new force structure such that we create the strategic conditions for success. Responses received during the consultation exercise will be used to inform the White Paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any enquiries or questions about the consultation process should be directed to &lt;a href="mailto:DCDSPers-RFC-FR20Consultation@mod.uk" title="Email enquiries or questions"&gt;DCDSPers-RFC-FR20Consultation@mod.uk&lt;/a&gt;. Please note this email address should not be used to send responses to the Green Paper - these should be provided via the Respond Online link below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>MOD awards £258 million Sea King helicopter support contract</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" title="Royal Air Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; fleets of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Aircraft/Helicopters/Sea-King-Mk5" title="Sea King Mk5"&gt;Sea Kings&lt;/a&gt; are best known for providing &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Operations/Enduring-Operations/UK/Search-and-Rescue" title="Search and Rescue"&gt;Search and Rescue&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="Search and Rescue"&gt;SAR&lt;/abbr&gt;) services in the UK and Falkland Islands. They can also be used to carry troops and provide airborne surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension to the Sea King Integrated Operational Support (&lt;abbr title="Sea King Integrated Operational Support"&gt;SKIOS&lt;/abbr&gt;) contract will ensure continued technical and maintenance support for the 90-strong helicopter fleet for the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD originally signed the &lt;abbr title="Sea King Integrated Operational Support"&gt;SKIOS&lt;/abbr&gt; arrangement with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.agustawestland.com/" title="AgustaWestland"&gt;AgustaWestland&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 and this is the final phase of the deal which is expected to sustain around 500 jobs at AgustaWestland’s UK headquarters at Yeovil, in the industry supply chain and at several &lt;abbr title="Search and Rescue"&gt;SAR&lt;/abbr&gt; bases across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Royal Navy Sea King Mk4 helicopter" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5786/45153254g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Royal Navy Sea King Mk4 helicopter is pictured on an operation over Helmand Province, Afghanistan (stock image) [Picture: Petty Officer Airman (Photographer) Mez Merrill, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phase of the contract will provide support until Sea King is retired from service in 2016 and replaced by &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Aircraft/Helicopters/Merlin-MK1" title="Merlin MK1"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Philip Dunne said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Sea King helicopter fleet has been in service for over 40 years providing a vital capability in air/sea rescue and surveillance. This maintenance agreement, securing 500 jobs across the UK, demonstrates our commitment to keeping this aircraft in top condition until it is retired from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Navy Captain Tony Gray, Defence Equipment and Support Sea King Team Leader, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Securing this contract ensures value for money for the taxpayer while maintaining the provision of search-and-rescue helicopters around the UK, 24-hours-a-day throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
