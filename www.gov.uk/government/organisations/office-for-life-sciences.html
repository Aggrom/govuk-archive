<h2 id="strategy-for-uk-life-sciences---one-year-on">Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On</h2>

<p>The Prime Minister has launched <a href="/government/publications/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on">Strategy for life sciences: one year on</a>. This report summarises progress made in the first 12 months since last year’s launch of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-1429-strategy-for-uk-life-sciences.pdf">Strategy for UK life sciences</a>. Health Life Sciences is one of the 11 sectors that have been prioritised as part of the government’s industrial strategy. See <a href="/government/speeches/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on">David Willetts’ speech relating to the report.</a> </p>

<p>The Strategy for UK life sciences is based on three pillars: </p>

<ul>
<li>building a UK life sciences ecosystem: the government is making it easier for researchers to commercialise academic research, placing clinical research at the heart of the NHS, and empowering patients to participate in research</li>
  <li>attracting, developing and rewarding talent: the government is introducing measures to attract and nurture world-leading talent and develop scientific excellence (these measures are ensuring that the UK offers exciting and rewarding careers for clinicians, scientists and technicians from all around the world)</li>
  <li>overcoming barriers and creating incentives for the promotion of healthcare innovation: the government is introducing measures to incentivise early-stage investment and nurture the best innovations through the translational funding gap to a point at which they can secure follow-on investment - we’ll continue to reduce the bureaucracy of setting up clinical trials to ensure that patients have access to promising, cost-effective, new treatments</li>
</ul>
<p>‘One year on’ reports the substantial progress made this year in implementing these measures. To strengthen networks between academia, industry and the NHS, the government is investing £1 billion a year through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS. The £180 million Biomedical Catalyst was introduced to bridge the ‘valley of death’ between the bench and the clinic, and the early response from industry is that this funding is already having the intended impact of stimulating innovative research. </p>

<p>Following on from the progress made to date, ‘One year on’ announces the government’s commitment to the sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients over the next three to five years. This work will initially focus on cancer patients, patients with rare diseases and infectious disease. We are working across government to ensure that research, academia and industry are key players in promoting the adoption of genomic technology to provide better healthcare and help the wider economy.</p>

<p>The strategy for UK life sciences was launched alongside, and is being implemented in collaboration with, the NHS chief executive’s review: <a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299">Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating adoption and diffusion in the NHS</a>. The update to this report, <a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/12/ihw-creating-change/">Creating change: innovation, health and wealth one year on</a>, was published on 10 December 2012.</p>

<p>Also published on 10 December 2012 was the latest report on the bioscience and health technology database, <a href="/government/publications/strength-opportunity-2012-the-landscape-of-the-medical-biotechnology-industrial-biotechnology-and-pharmaceutical-sectors-in-the-uk-annual-update-december-2012">Strength and opportunity 2012</a>, and also <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/sectoropportunities/lifesciences.html">The new UK life science prospectus: life sciences in the UK</a></p>

<h2 id="life-sciences-in-the-uk">Life Sciences in the UK</h2>

<p>The UK has one of the strongest and most productive life sciences industries in the world, contributing to patient well-being as well as supporting growth. UK life science industries generate turnover of over £50bn and employ 167,500 people in over 4,500 companies.</p>

<p>The industry is high-tech, innovative and highly diverse, spanning pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, and industrial biotechnology and has applications across many other sectors. Through the development of innovative medicines, medical technologies and services, its businesses contribute to a stronger and fairer society, helping people enjoy better health, well-being and quality of life. They are also helping the UK improve its sustainability and increase rates of decarbonisation.</p>

<p>The government is building on and fostering these strengths and responding to the changing global commercial environment. We want to make the UK the location of choice for pioneering life sciences research and development (<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>) and manufacturing investment, so that life sciences will continue to be vibrant in the UK and a key contributor to sustained economic growth and health improvements.</p>

<p>The Office for Life Sciences (<abbr title="Office of Life Sciences">OLS</abbr>) works closely with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">Department of Health (<abbr title="Department of Health">DH</abbr>)</a>, championing biotechnology and the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. We also work with <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk">UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI)</a>, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk">Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)</a> and other departments, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>)</a>, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk">NHS</a> and the life sciences industry.</p>

<h2 id="views-on-the-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research">Views on the use of animals in scientific research</h2>

<p>The Ipsos MORI report <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/ipsos-mori-views-on-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research-september-2012.pdf">‘Views on the use of animals in scientific research’</a> presents the findings of a 2012 survey on awareness of, and public attitudes towards, the use of animals in scientific research. This survey has been carried out since 1999 on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The report shows that 85% of the representative sample conditionally accept the use of animals in scientific research. While this year’s findings show a decline in overall public acceptance, it also identifies that a significant proportion of the representative sample (40%) would like to know more information about the use of animals in scientific research before forming a firm opinion.</p>

<p>The government has challenged the scientific community to respond to these findings.</p>

<h2 id="areas-of-work-for-the-ols">Areas of work for the <abbr title="Office of Life Sciences">OLS</abbr>

The demonstrator has 2 main applications: </p>

<ul>
<li>a proof of concept facility to scale-up the production of materials to near commercial levels </li>
  <li>a product manufacturing facility for clients experiencing temporary capacity restrictions</li>
</ul>
<p>The National Industrial Biotechnology Facility (<abbr title="National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator">NIBF</abbr>) will allow biotechnology companies to de-risk product and process development. By exploring and then optimising processes, companies will be able to calculate the most cost-effective combination of materials, process steps and sequences, and the equipment needed to manufacture profitably. Consequently, they will minimise the risk of investing in the wrong capital equipment, using inefficient processes or facing unexpected costs.</p>
