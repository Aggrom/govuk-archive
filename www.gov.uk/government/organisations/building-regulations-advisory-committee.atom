    <title>The new home on the web for DFT and DCLG</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DFT&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the Department for Communities and Local Government (&lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt;), along with 3 of their public bodies, have today (15 November, 2012) become the first central government organisations to move their corporate and policy content onto the new GOV.UK website - the new single home for all government services and information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inside Government section on GOV.UK makes it simpler, clearer and faster to find out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how government works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what the government is doing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how you can get involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="new-web-addresses"&gt;New web addresses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All web addresses have been redirected, so you don’t need to update your bookmarks, but you might want to make a note of the new addresses: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dclg" title="DCLG"&gt;www.gov.uk/dclg&lt;/a&gt; - Department for Communities and Local Government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dft" title="DFT"&gt;www.gov.uk/dft&lt;/a&gt; - Department for Transport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dsa" title="DSA"&gt;www.gov.uk/dsa&lt;/a&gt; - Driving Standards Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/brac" title="BRAC"&gt;www.gov.uk/brac&lt;/a&gt; - Building Regulations Advisory Committee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/pins" title="PINS"&gt;www.gov.uk/pins&lt;/a&gt; - The Planning Inspectorate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inside Government section of GOV.UK has been designed to make government information more easy to find and more transparent for the user. For the first time, you can begin to find out what’s happening inside government all in one place, and in a clear, consistent and transparent format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the new website looks very different from the ones it has replaced. The look is one obvious difference but many of the other significant changes are less visible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="topics"&gt;Topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now see information from multiple government departments grouped by topics. For example, you can see how policies from both &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DFT&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Department for Communities and Local Government"&gt;DCLG&lt;/abbr&gt; are contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/economic-growth"&gt;economic growth&lt;/a&gt; or combating &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/climate-change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="clear-policies"&gt;Clear policies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From today, those departments and agencies who have moved to GOV.UK are publishing their policies according to the outcome the government is trying to achieve. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-roads-safer" title="making roads safer"&gt;making roads safer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-greenhouse-gases-and-other-emissions-from-transport" title="reducing greenhouse gases and other emissions from transport"&gt;reducing greenhouse gases and other emissions from transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-available-homes" title="increasing the number of available homes"&gt;increasing the number of available homes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each policy, you can see a list of all the related announcements, consultations and publications in one list, called ‘activity’. The activity tab makes it easy for you to track what is happening on the policies that interest you, for example all government activity that relates to &lt;a href="/government/policies/developing-a-new-high-speed-rail-network/activity" title="developing a high speed rail network: activity"&gt;developing a high speed rail network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="more-about-inside-government-and-govuk"&gt;More about Inside Government and GOV.UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you see today is just the beginning, with just 2 departments and 3 other organisations live. Work will continue as other departments and organisations, many hundreds in total, move their information to GOV.UK. This will happen in batches and will be completed by March 2014.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) Annual Report 2010</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This annual report relates to the advisory work carried out by the Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) in 2010 and is the eleventh report published on behalf of the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRAC has continued to work closely with officials in the Department for Communities and Local Government to provide strategic and technical advice and views on a broad range of issues related to the Building Regulations and building standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year BRAC assisted the Department in giving their views and comments on a range of areas, including: The 2013 Review of Building Regulations; Consolidation of the Building Regulations 2010; Lifetime Home Standards; Reviews of Parts L (Conservation of Fuel and Power), F (Ventilation), and Part J (Combustion Appliances and Fuel Storage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reflects the work of the Committee in 2010, under the previous Government (until May 2010). It should not all necessarily be construed as a commentary of the current Government’s policy positions and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) Annual Report 2009</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This annual report relates to the advisory work carried out by the Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) in 2009 and is the tenth report published on behalf of the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRAC has continued to work closely with officials in the Department for Communities and Local Government to provide strategic and technical advice and views on a broad range of issues related to the Building Regulations and building standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year BRAC assisted the Department in finalising the &lt;em&gt;Future of Building Control Implementation Plan&lt;/em&gt; and commented on a number of proposals aimed at developing the Competent Person Schemes framework. The Committee also ran a number of working parties to assist the Department in reviewing and developing proposals for amendments to Parts A and C, Parts G, J, L, F and M of the Building Regulations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in recent years BRAC also gave its views on sustainable buildings initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reflects the work of the Committee in 2009 under the last Government. It should not necessarily be construed as a commentary of the new Government’s policy positions and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
