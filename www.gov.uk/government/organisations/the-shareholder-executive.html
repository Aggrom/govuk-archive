            <div class="body">
              <div class="govspeak">
<h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>

<p>The Shareholder Executive was set up in September 2003 to work with shareholder departments in government to improve fundamentally the government’s capabilities and performance as a shareholder.  Located within the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>), we work closely with all central government departments, most notably HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office. </p>

<p>Our current remit comprises: </p>

<ul>
<li>portfolio management: We manage a cross-Whitehall portfolio of businesses and have responsibility for project managing the government’s asset management programme. </li>
  <li>Royal Mail &amp; Post Office: Managing the government’s shareholding in Royal Mail Holdings plc, this includes subsidiaries Royal Mail Group Ltd (the letter delivery business) and Post Office Ltd (which operates the post office network). </li>
  <li>corporate finance practice: We offer a wide range of corporate finance expertise and advice across government. This includes the appraisal and negotiation of financial assistance to companies in the UK and provision of financial, analytical and negotiation support to Ministers and Departments in their dealings with companies. In addition, we are also responsible for a number of non-portfolio asset sales.</li>
  <li>Information economy: Policy responsibility for the digital sector in the UK and for cyber security, telecoms and resilience (both UK and internationally).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our current remit covers a portfolio of 20 businesses (from organisations as large as the Royal Mail to smaller businesses like the UK Hydrographic Office) spanning a number of government departments across Whitehall. </p>

<p>We offer a wide range of corporate finance expertise and advice across government, which is applied beyond the portfolio of government-owned businesses. This includes the appraisal and negotiation of financial assistance to companies in the UK as well as provision of financial, analytical and negotiation support to Ministers and Departments in their dealings with companies. For example, we provide corporate finance advice on major initiatives to a range of departmental clients across government in the following areas: Financial Interventions; Launch Investment; Rescue and Restructuring Aid; Grant for Business Investment; and commercial advice on key third party relationships. </p>

<p>We are also responsible for policy within <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> for cyber security, telecoms and resilience - both in the UK and internationally - and for the digital sector in the UK.  The information Economy Directorate within the Shareholder Executive has important roles in a number of areas that are critical to the future of the UK economy, by supporting economic prosperity, protecting national security, safeguarding the publics’ way of life and making a significant and valued contribution to the government’s growth agenda.</p>

<h2 id="our-role">Our role</h2>

<p>Government-owned businesses make an important contribution to the UK. They help to deliver essential public services, provide advice and support to other parts of government and to the public, and generate value that can be invested in other public services. </p>

<p>The challenges these businesses face now are greater than ever. Some are finding that their traditional customer base and markets are dwindling or becoming less certain. Some are facing increasing competition. For others the goal is to seek new markets for their products and services. </p>

<p>The role of the Shareholder Executive is to work with government departments and management teams to help these businesses perform better. We want to create a climate of ownership that, while challenging, is genuinely supportive and provides the framework for them to be successful. </p>

<p>We play a different role depending upon the situation of each of the businesses in our portfolio. Depending on the portfolio business, our role ranges from an executive to an advisory role: </p>

<ul>
<li>executive role: Where we are accountable to the ministers and Permanent Secretary of the shareholding department. </li>
  <li>joint team role: Where we work alongside shareholder teams in the respective departments.  </li>
  <li>advisory role: Where Departmental teams are accountable to their ministers and Permanent Secretary for the discharge of the shareholding function. The Shareholder Executive is accountable to each individual departmental shareholding team for the quality of its advice and input. </li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering this challenging target will require a joint effort across a wide range of government departments and public sector organisations. The Shareholder Executive has a central role to play through its responsibility for project managing the Government’s overall asset management programme.</p>

<p>The Shareholder Executive is responsible for co-ordinating and project managing the release programme, and maintaining impetus across the 10-year lifespan of the work. To do this, the Shareholder Executive is working closely with colleagues across Government, including <abbr title="Department for Culture, Media and Sport">DCMS</abbr>, which has overall responsibility for spectrum policy in Government, <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr>, MoD and <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Following announcement of the 500MHz target, the Central Spectrum Release Group (<abbr title="Central Spectrum Release Group">CSRG</abbr>) was established to lead the delivery of the 500MHz. The first deliverable of the <abbr title="Central Spectrum Release Group">CSRG</abbr>, which is chaired by the Shareholder Executive, was a publication setting out the Government’s strategy for meeting the target combined with a ‘call for evidence’ from the industry. The document, entitled ‘Enabling UK Growth: releasing public sector spectrum’, was published in March 2011.</p>

<h3 id="our-approach">Our approach</h3>

<p>To deliver our objectives, the Shareholder Executive takes as a fundamental principle the need for government to act as an engaged and informed shareholder. We use a system based on the private equity model of share ownership, adapted to recognise the longer-term nature of the government’s financial interests and the non-commercial policy objectives it sets. </p>

<p>Our professional approach draws on four principles: clarity, value, transparency and professionalism.</p>

<ul>
<li>clarity: because government as shareholder has all too rarely in the past provided businesses with clear and consistent objectives. The Shareholder Executive is working to establish a remit for each business that sets out clear, consistent and durable objectives. These will reconcile commercial and policy objectives and make transparent the financial implications of non-commercial requirements.</li>
  <li>value: because government-owned businesses should provide a return on the taxpayer’s money that has been invested in them. Our aim is that, within the framework of policy, regulatory and customer parameters set by government, businesses will deliver sustained, positive returns and meet or exceed their cost of capital over time.  </li>
  <li>transparency: because it is important for management and shareholders to be accountable for their performance against objectives. Greater transparency and accountability should drive improved performance.</li>
  <li>professionalism: because government should draw on best practice from the private and public sectors, and apply a consistent approach to shareholding across departmental boundaries.at the individual business level, and hence for the portfolio as a whole. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="current-priorities">Current priorities</h2>

<ul>
<li>to manage the government’s shareholding in Royal Mail Holdings plc, which includes subsidiaries Royal Mail Group Ltd (the letter delivery business) and Post Office Ltd (which operates the post office network), which includes: modernisation of the Royal Mail business; introduction of private capital into Royal Mail Group Ltd; achieving a stable and sustainable post office network </li>
  <li>to assess the options to monetise the Student Loan book. </li>
  <li>to bring together several government bodies and data in a Public Data Corporation (<abbr title="Public Data Corporation">PDC</abbr>) to provide an unprecedented level of easily accessible public data and drive further efficiency in the delivery of public services. </li>
  <li>Supporting the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (<abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>) in running an effective Parent Body </li>
  <li>Organisation (<abbr title="Parent Body Organisation">PBO</abbr>) competition for the Magnox Ltd and RSRL sites and the review of the Sellafield contract. </li>
  <li>to pursue the commercialisation, efficiency and examination of alternative ownership structures for other core assets within the <abbr title="The Shareholder Executive">ShEx</abbr> portfolio. </li>
  <li>to advise on the possible sale of non-core assets managed within the corporate finance practice as part of the government’s growth and efficiency agenda. </li>
  <li>to advise on possible financial interventions by the government and advise on implications arising from companies that are in distress. </li>
  <li>to provide technical support for the establishment of a Business Bank.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="annual-review-2011-12">Annual Review 2011-12</h3>

<p>In 2011-12 the Shareholder Executive once again played an important role in supporting the government’s key commercial objectives. We continued to represent government as a value-focused shareholder across a broad range of state-owned and partially state-owned businesses. The Shareholder Executive also worked with Ministers and Departments to provide financial, analytical and negotiation support in a number of their dealings with companies – especially those in complex situations, and often when they have been facing severe financial pressures.</p>

<h3 id="shareholder-executive-structure">Shareholder Executive structure</h3>

<p>The Shareholder Executive is structured around four separate units – the Portfolio Unit; the Corporate Finance Practice; the Information Economy Unit; and the Royal Mail and Post Office Unit - led by Anthony Odgers, Mark Russell, Ken McCallum and Roger Lowe respectively. </p>

<h3 id="information-economy-unit">Information Economy Unit</h3>

<p>The Information Economy Unit is responsible for policy on cyber security, telecoms and resilience (both in the UK and Internationally) and for the digital sector within the UK, key to the future of the UK economy and supporting the government’s growth agenda.</p>

<h3 id="royal-mail-and-post-office-unit">Royal Mail and Post Office Unit</h3>

<p>The Royal Mail and Post Office Unit manages the government’s shareholding in Royal Mail Holdings plc, which includes subsidiaries Royal Mail Group Ltd (the letter delivery business) and Post Office Ltd (which operates the post office network). We report directly to <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> Ministers and its Permanent Secretary, as the shareholding department. </p>

<p>Although the Shareholder Executive is structured around four separate units, many members of the staff work across more than one business unit given the complementary nature of activities and skills required. This flexibility also allows us to quickly respond to increased activities in certain units at short notice. </p>

<p><abbr title="The Shareholder Executive">ShEx</abbr> is managed through an Executive Committee Stephen Lovegrove (Chief Executive), Mark Russell (Deputy Chief Executive), the three other Unit heads and Mark Boyle (Chief Operating Officer). </p>

<h3 id="shareholder-executive-board">Shareholder Executive Board</h3>

<p>The Board has an advisory role in relation to the work of the Shareholder Executive, which includes setting strategic direction in the light of Ministerial objectives, periodically reviewing the delivery of objectives and considering any specific issues referred to it by the Shareholder Executive’s Senior Management Team. </p>

<p>The Board is chaired by Patrick O’Sullivan, Chairman of the Shareholder Executive. The Chief Executive, Deputy Chief Executive and Heads of the three operational Units make up the other internal members of the Board. In addition, there are three non-executive members with experience of the existing and new areas of the Shareholder Executive’s business.</p>

<h2 id="ownership-framework">Ownership framework</h2>

<h3 id="legal-form">Legal form</h3>

<p>The Shareholder Executive portfolio contains a number of different types of business operating under different frameworks. There are four principal frameworks in use in the portfolio:</p>

<ul>
<li>Companies Act Companies: These companies have the same standard formal governance framework as private sector companies and are required to report to the same standards. The government has a range of shareholding percentages from 33% to 100%.</li>
  <li>statutory corporations: These corporations are formed under specific legislation which, in the main, replicates the Companies Act.</li>
  <li>Limited Liability Partnerships: <abbr title="Limited Liability Partnership">LLPs</abbr> share many of the features of a normal partnership, but offer reduced personal responsibility for business debts.</li>
  <li>trading funds: These are executive agencies of government that, under the Trading Funds Act 1973, are allowed to net off their revenues against costs. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="national-accounts-classification">National accounts classification</h3>

<p>Government-owned businesses are generally classified by the Office of National Statistics in national accounts as public corporations (PC). PCs are publicly-owned trading bodies that largely recover their costs from fees charged to customers.</p>

<p>The government has a strong fiscal interest in the profitability of government-owned businesses. This is because the net operating surplus of public corporations scores as a receipt in the National Accounts definition of the current balance. One of the government’s fiscal rules is that over the economic cycle the current balance is in balance or surplus. Everything else being equal, a more profitable portfolio of government-owned businesses would increase the current balance surplus.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-departmental-resources">Impact on departmental resources</h2>

<p>Government-owned businesses classified by the Office of National Statistics as public corporations can have an impact on the budgets of their parent departments in one of two ways.</p>

<h3 id="public-corporations-pcs">Public Corporations (PCs)</h3>

<p>For most PCs, HM Treasury operates a budgeting arrangement whereby departments are required to obtain a dividend from their PC to match a cost of capital charge in their Department Expenditure Limit (DEL). Any shortfall in performance by a PC (manifested by a reduction in dividend from the PC), must be covered from the parent department’s Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit, which has a consequent impact on the funds available to the department. </p>

<p>The parent department may retain dividends recovered in excess of the cost of capital charge. Any lending to the PC, either Voted lending from the department or loans from the National Loans fund, score in the department’s Capital DEL. Therefore, capital borrowed by the PC seen as funding provided by the parent department, which is then unavailable for other uses. As such, the PC must compete with other Vote-funded projects for any funding that is required, regardless of the financial return.</p>

<h3 id="self-financing-public-corporations">Self-Financing Public Corporations.</h3>

<p>Some PCs are designated as Self-Financing Public Corporations (SFPC). SFPCs must normally trade profitably without subsidies, mainly with non-government customers, and must not perform regulatory functions. Status as an SFPC is determined by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<p>In contrast to a PC, a SFPC will score in Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) and is therefore more easily managed by the parent department. While HM Treasury may require a contribution from the parent department’s DEL for any underperformance from the SFPC, this contribution is usually substantially less than the actual loss recorded by the SFPC and is often capped. Any overperformance does not lead to a DEL credit for the parent department </p>

<h3 id="borrowing-regime">Borrowing regime</h3>

<p>For both PC and SFPCs, the principles of government accounting on commercial borrowing are the same. Other than for very short-term borrowing (i.e. overdrafts), government should provide all the external financing for government-owned businesses, and the businesses should not borrow from the private sector. This is because, unless the private sector debt provider is bearing any genuine risk (i.e. that the business will default on the loan), such lending would not offer value for money for the government, as the government is able to borrow more cheaply than the individual business.</p>

<p>However, the principles also state that the businesses themselves must be charged at the market rate, to ensure that they do not get any commercial advantage from the ability to borrow at below market rate. The rate of borrowing is set by reference to the market conditions and risk of the sector.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-finance-practice-cfp">Corporate Finance Practice (<abbr title="Corporate Finance Practice">CFP</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Corporate Finance Practice">CFP</abbr> provides corporate finance advice to <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> and other government departments. <abbr title="Corporate Finance Practice">CFP</abbr> has a broad range of expertise covering corporate finance, corporate recovery and capital markets. Activities generally fall into three main categories: Launch Investment, Grant for Business Investment, and wider corporate finance advice (including advice on corporate intervention by Government).</p>

<h3 id="corporate-financeintervention-advice">Corporate finance/intervention advice</h3>

<p>Over the past few years the Shareholder Executive was engaged to evaluate and advise <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> on the financial aspects of significant targeted potential government interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of the current downturn in key sectors of the UK economy. These initiatives have covered businesses in the automotive, aerospace and defence industries.</p>

<p>The Corporate Finance Practice is also responsible for a number of non-portfolio assets as well as a continuing role on Shareholder Executive’s traditional corporate finance and project work. The non-portfolio assets, many of which were included in the Treasury’s OEP asset programme, are characterised by the absence of a formal shareholder mandate. Shareholder Executive’s role is primarily to advise shareholding Departments on the best way to deliver value and efficiency. </p>

<h2 id="select-assignments">Select assignments</h2>

<h3 id="financial-support-for-uk-helicopter-production-research-and-development-2011">Financial support for UK helicopter production, research and development (2011)</h3>

<p>The Business Secretary has announced £32 million of public finance to support helicopter production, research and development in the UK. The investment includes a £22 million loan on market terms to AgustaWestland in order to assist production for the new AW169 light intermediate commercial helicopter at AW’s Yeovil plant. The new aircraft is a diversification for the Yeovil site as it has previously focused on military aircraft. Separately, a total of £10 million in R&amp;D grants have been delivered through the Technology Strategy Board Scheme. These grants are aimed at boosting research and development in advanced rotorcraft, benefiting small and medium sized enterprises in the supply chain and universities which train the next generation of engineers and technicians. The Shareholder Executive was involved in negotiating the structure of the support, including the terms of the loan.</p>

<h3 id="government-interventions-in-automobile-sector-200910">Government interventions in automobile sector (2009/10)</h3>

<p>The Shareholder Executive corporate finance practice was heavily involved in the government’s support for industry, and the automotive industry in particular. Shareholder Executive worked with GM and a number of European governments to structure a support package for Opel / Vauxhall, leading the government’s negotiations with the company. Whilst GM ultimately declined the European governments’ support package, the UK government’s relationship with GM has strengthened as a result, and the UK plants continue to perform a key role in the strategic direction of the group.</p>

<h3 id="banking-200910">Banking (2009/10)</h3>

<p>Before the creation of UK Financial Investments (<abbr title="UK Financial Investments">UKFI</abbr>), the Shareholder Executive led the advice provided to HMG with regard to the support to Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley. During 2009, the Shareholder Executive led the separation of Northern Rock into two new legal entities - a new deposit taking and mortgage lending bank that takes over the old name, and the old entity (now known as Northern Rock Asset Management) which no longer takes customer savings and will run-off its portfolio of £60bn in mortgages over the next 20-30 years. Responsibilities for Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley have now passed to <abbr title="UK Financial Investments">UKFI</abbr>. </p>

<h2 id="public-sector-spectrum">Public sector spectrum</h2>

<p>Spectrum is a finite and valuable resource that enables growth and innovation. Commercial and public uses of spectrum are hugely important to society and the economy, through a variety of applications as shown in the figure below. </p>

<h3 id="public-sector-spectrum-release-target">Public Sector Spectrum Release Target</h3>

<p>The government is committed to ensuring that spectrum is utilised as efficiently as possible to drive economic growth and innovation. This commitment is reflected in the 2010 Spending Review announcement that at least 500 MHz of public sector spectrum holdings below 5 GHz should be released by 2020.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-unit">Portfolio Unit</h2>

<p><a href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/35746/shareholder-executive-portfolio-unit.pdf">Shareholder Executive portfolio</a></p>

<p>The Portfolio Unit is responsible for a portfolio of government owned or part owned-owned businesses. The businesses in this Unit include those where <abbr title="The Shareholder Executive">ShEx</abbr> has a clear shareholding mandate or a seat on the board. Our involvement in each business varies across the Portfolio Unit depending on our agreed role and ability to have the greatest impact. </p>

<p>The businesses are actively reviewed through a formal Investment Review cycle as well as ongoing day-to-day monitoring. Key areas of focus include business performance and strategy, management composition and remuneration, financing and, where appropriate, changes in Government’s shareholding. </p>

<p>The portfolio includes the following businesses, some of which have been part of <abbr title="The Shareholder Executive">ShEx</abbr>’s portfolio for some time and others which are recent additions: </p>

<h3 id="select-transactionsassignments">Select transactions/assignments</h3>

<h4 id="m-sale-of-the-horserace-totalisator-board-the-tote-to-betfred-201110">£265m Sale of the Horserace Totalisator Board (the Tote) to Betfred (2011/10)</h4>

<p>The Shareholder Executive led the sale of Tote on behalf of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (<abbr title="Department for Culture, Media and Sport">DCMS</abbr>). Sale of the Tote to the UK bookmaker Betfred was agreed for £265m. </p>

<p>This came at less than a year after the Chancellor announced the government’s intention to resolve the future of the Tote, and follows numerous failed attempts to do so in the past. The transaction delivers much needed certainty to the Tote and its employees so they can continue to develop the business as part of a larger group for the benefit of all stakeholders. In addition, racing will benefit from payments of more than £155m as a result of this deal.</p>

<p>The sale has been achieved in line with the government’s declared objectives of recognising the support the Tote currently provides to the racing industry whilst also securing value to the taxpayer.</p>

<h4 id="vesting-of-the-royal-mint-200910">Vesting of the Royal Mint (2009/10)</h4>

<p>The Shareholder Executive took a proactive role in improving the performance of the Royal Mint over a number of years and this culminated in successful vesting on 31 December 2009. Vesting has allowed the Mint to enjoy the benefits of becoming a company, including a clearer governance framework and greater transparency and focus in its commercial decision-making. </p>

<h4 id="sale-of-commercial-business-unit-of-uk-atomic-energy-authority-200910">Sale of commercial business unit of UK Atomic Energy Authority (2009/10)</h4>

<p>The UK Atomic Energy Authority reached an agreement with Babcock International Group for the sale of 100% of its commercial arm, <abbr title="The UK Atomic Energy Authority">UKAEA</abbr> Limited, for £50m. The sale followed the announcement of 30 March 2009 that UK Atomic Energy Authority was seeking a buyer for <abbr title="The UK Atomic Energy Authority">UKAEA</abbr> Limited. The sale of the business would help to reinforce the UK’s strong heritage in the nuclear industry and provide a platform for the further development of skills in this important marketplace. </p>

<h2 id="royal-mail-group">Royal Mail Group</h2>

<p>The Shareholder Executive manages the government’s shareholding in Royal Mail Holdings plc, which includes subsidiaries Royal Mail Group Ltd (the letter delivery business) and Post Office Ltd (which operates the post office network). We report directly to <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> Ministers and its Permanent Secretary, as the shareholding department. </p>

<p>The Shareholder Executive has recently undertaken significant work on Postal Services Act 2011, aimed at safeguarding the future of Royal Mail and the universal postal service. We led on its provisions relating to the ownership of Royal Mail and the Post Office, on pensions and on special administration. We also ran the overall Bill process for government. </p>

<h3 id="the-act">The Act:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Repeals the statutory requirement for Royal Mail to be owned by the government, allowing for a sale of shares in the future</li>
  <li>In preparation for a sale, allows the government to transfer the accrued pension rights of the members of the Royal Mail Pension Plan to a new government scheme</li>
  <li>As part of a sale, provides for 10% of the shares to go to an employee share scheme - the largest of any major privatisation </li>
  <li>Keeps Post Office Ltd in public ownership, and allows it to move to a mutual ownership model in the future</li>
  <li>Transfers regulatory responsibility for postal services from Postcomm to Ofcom. At the same time, a new regulatory framework will be established</li>
  <li>Establishes a special administration regime to ensure the post is still delivered if the universal service provider were ever at risk of entering insolvency proceedings in the future</li>
</ul>
