          Our careers for generalist and specialist staff: recruitment, diversity, vetting process and the benefits of working for us.
        </p>
        <div class="body">
          <div class="govspeak">
<p>To achieve our policy goals we need the right workforce with the right skills in the right places. New technology and ways of working are enabling us to deploy more staff to frontline diplomatic activity and to the emerging powers.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> employs over 10,000 local staff across its global network. Local staff play an important and growing part in ensuring our missions overseas run smoothly. Unlike UK-based members of staff (who are members of the UK Diplomatic or Civil Services), local staff are recruited and employed locally by our overseas missions, and their pay and terms and conditions of service are set in accordance with local laws and what similar employers there are paying. </p>

<p>Local staff carry out a wide variety of duties. Many work in the Visa or Consular Sections of our Missions; helping people who wish to visit the UK, or British citizens who are travelling or living overseas. Others work in the Management Section helping to run the Mission and its estate. There are also opportunities to work as Public Diplomacy, Political or Economic Officers, and over 40 of the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>’s overseas posts are headed up by local staff officers. </p>

<h2 id="current-vacancies">Current vacancies</h2>

<p>We list all our current vacancies on this page, with details of how the recruitment is taking place. The <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> has appointed Hays, a recruitment agency, to manage its recruitment process for roles based in the UK. Details of <a rel="external" href="http://www1.hays.co.uk/jobs/fco/index.aspx" title="FCO vacancies at Hay">current vacancies</a> appear on the Hays website. Some <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> posts are also advertised on the <a rel="external" href="https://jobs.civilservice.gov.uk/company/nghr/jobs.cgi">Civil Service jobs website</a>. </p>

<p>Although <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> staff from our UK headquarters are often given overseas postings, the staff employed by Embassies and High Commissions abroad are recruited in country. Current vacancies for local staff can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/find-an-embassy/">websites of our missions overseas</a>.</p>

</section><h2 id="careers">Careers</h2>
<p>The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office recruits generalist staff at several different levels, listed below, from administrative assistants to team leaders. Jobs for specialist staff like Legal Advisers and Research Analysts are advertised when vacancies arise based on operational need. </p>

<p>All external recruitment into the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> is based on the Civil Service Recruitment Principles. This has 3 main requirements: that recruitment must be based on merit, be fair and be open.  This means that we must appoint the best person for the job, regardless of their background, have no bias in the selection process and ensure that potential applicants have reasonable access to information about the roles and their requirements.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-assistants-a1">Administrative assistants (A1)</h3>
<p>Administrative assistants are the first level of administrative support within the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>. We look for people with all-round IT, administrative and organisational skills, including running electronic and paper filing systems, data-entry, customer service and invoice processing.</p>

<p>The starting salary for administrative assistants as of April 2010 is £16,635, plus a £3,520 London Location Allowance payable when working in London. All members of staff are also entitled to a competitive package of benefits.</p>

<h3 id="executive-assistants-a2">Executive assistants (A2)</h3>

<p>Executive assistants provide vital support for the Diplomatic Service both in London and in our posts abroad. Applicants must be able to work as part of a team and show individual flair and initiative. With the support of your fellow team members, you will be required to assess and prioritise your workload and handle conflicting priorities, often under pressure.</p>

<p>The starting salary for executive assistants as of April 2010 is £18,885, plus a £3,520 London Location Allowance payable when working in London. All members of staff are also entitled to a competitive package of benefits.</p>

<h3 id="fast-stream-entrants-c4">Fast Stream entrants (C4)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> recruits a number of graduates through the <a rel="external" href="http://faststream.civilservice.gov.uk">Civil Service Fast Stream</a> every year. Policy entrants usually spend their first year doing policy work, including handling our relations with other countries, dealing with security and defence issues or working to improve human rights abroad. They then often spend a year doing service delivery or corporate work, such as working in our consular department helping distressed British nationals overseas, or in human resources. Many then go overseas. Policy entrants join the diplomatic service. The amount of time spent overseas varies from one policy entrant to another and there is flexibility available to suit individual circumstances.</p>

<p>Applicants for the diplomatic service also have to pass an additional final selection board on top of the regular Fast Stream testing to prove their ability to fulfil the particular requirements for our department.</p>

<p>Fast Streamers in the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> can expect a starting salary of around £27k including London Location Allowance and a competitive package of benefits.</p>

<p>Visit the <a rel="external" href="http://faststream.civilservice.gov.uk">Civil Service Fast Stream website</a> for more information and to apply.</p>

<p>Applicants must meet our nationality and residency requirements, pass our strict security vetting process and possess a Bachelor’s Degree at 2.2 or above. </p>

<h3 id="economists">Economists</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> recruits economists who can apply their skills to policy issues in international macroeconomics, financial markets and trade and development. </p>

<p>Economists with professional experience are also recruited from time to time, when vacancies arise. For information about vacancies and applications, see the <a rel="external" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/ges/">Government Economic Service website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="legal-advisers">Legal advisers</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> is the main centre of expertise in public international law within government. Our legal advisers provide legal advice to ministers and officials within the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> and beyond on a range of matters. </p>

<p>We have around 30 lawyers based in London - all members of the Diplomatic Service. We currently have several lawyers serving at missions across the world. Most legal advisers can expect to serve one or more tours of duty overseas.</p>

<p>Our legal advisers are also consulted by other government departments on issues of international law. They are not, however, part of the Government Legal Service, but maintain close ties on training and continuing professional development.</p>

<h3 id="research-analysts">Research analysts</h3>
<p>Research analyst roles provide an excellent opportunity to become one of Whitehall’s leading experts on an area of foreign policy.</p>

<p>They provide historical and forward-looking perspectives, challenge received wisdom where necessary and ensure that <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> and wider-Whitehall customers are aware of what outside experts are saying about the subject. Research analysts undertake research visits and participate in relevant academic events both in the UK and overseas.</p>

<p>Applicants should have a broad and extensive understanding of their field. Those without a postgraduate degree in a related subject and/or directly related work experience are unlikely to be considered. </p>

<h3 id="overseas-security-managers">Overseas security managers</h3>
<p>The safety and security of our overseas staff and Embassy and High Commission buildings are of the utmost importance to us. Overseas security managers (<abbr title="Overseas Security Managers">OSMs</abbr>) play an important role in this. A career as an <abbr title="Overseas Security Manager">OSM</abbr> in the Diplomatic Service offers you a chance to see the world while doing work that makes a difference to Britain and British people.</p>

<p><abbr title="Overseas Security Managers">OSMs</abbr> spend most of their time working in our embassies and high commissions overseas and could be responsible for everything from operating electronic security systems to organising the special security needs of VIPs. Management is an important part of the job; <abbr title="Overseas Security Managers">OSMs</abbr> may be asked to manage a guard force in countries where the guard’s knowledge of English cannot be assured. Training is provided throughout an <abbr title="Overseas Security Manager">OSM</abbr>’s career to help learn new skills and develop existing ones, including foreign languages. In order to become an <abbr title="Overseas Security Manager">OSM</abbr>, you should possess previous experience in security professions and/or the armed forces as well as three GCSEs or equivalent (including both Maths and English).</p>

<p><abbr title="Overseas Security Manager">OSM</abbr> positions are recruited for only when the operational need arises. </p>

<h3 id="other-specialist-positions">Other specialist positions</h3>
<p>When operationally required, the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> recruits other types of specialist positions. These include IT specialists, procurement specialists, clinic nurses, forced marriage caseworkers and accountants.</p>

<h2 id="work-experience-internships-and-international-secondments">Work experience, internships and international secondments</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> offers work experience and secondment opportunities at its London headquarters and internationally. You can find details of the schemes and how to apply in:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>Embracing diversity will help us meet our key policy objectives, such as: championing human rights and equality; helping to resolve conflicts; attracting talented people from all sections of society.</p>

<p>We aim to serve all sections of society and be credible representatives of modern Britain. We can only do this if we are a progressive employer which welcomes and develops talented people, regardless of background.</p>

<h3 id="our-diversity-policies">Our diversity policies</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> does not discriminate on the grounds of race, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation or disability.</p>

<p>All staff are appointed on merit, but we encourage applications from sections of society currently under-represented in the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>, including women, those from minority ethnic backgrounds and people with disabilities.</p>

<p>All our recruitment is governed by the <a rel="external" href="http://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/civil-service-recruitment/">Civil Service Commission’s Recruitment Principles</a>.
Our aim is to be a world leader in embracing and harnessing difference, creating equality of opportunity and eliminating discrimination.</p>

<p>To achieve this we are:</p>

<h2 id="vetting">Vetting</h2>
<p>To join the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> as a permanent member of staff you must undergo 2 rounds of checks: the Baseline Personnel Security Standard and Developed Vetting.</p>

<p>The Baseline Personnel Security Standard is a basic recruitment check required by the Cabinet Office and undertaken by our recruitment team in order to verify your identity details. It seeks to prevent identity fraud, illegal working and deception generally. You will need to fill in a basic form and provide the recruitment team with standard documents to undergo this process.</p>

<p>The Developed Vetting (<abbr title="Developed Vetting">DV</abbr>) process is the highest standard form of National Security Vetting and must be undertaken for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>to gain assurances that you are not susceptible to pressure from foreign intelligence agencies, terrorist groups or other organisations wishing to undermine Parliamentary democracy</li>
  <li>to confirm an individual’s suitability to access and handle very sensitive information and material</li>
  <li>to satisfy requirements for access to material originating from other countries and international organisations</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Developed Vetting">DV</abbr> process includes a check of your identity documents and employment and educational references. Other checks are carried out against your financial records with the Security Service and the Criminal Records Bureau. Enquiries will also be made into your health to determine whether you have suffered from certain medical and psychological conditions which could have a bearing on your fitness to handle very sensitive information. Additional stages may be required for some candidates: for example, medical assessments.</p>

<p>The Developed Vetting process takes approximately 4 months to complete, but this can vary depending on individual circumstances. Further details of the vetting process will be available by contacting the <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>. </p>
