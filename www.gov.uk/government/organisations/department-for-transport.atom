    <title>Government's rail strategy receives independent endorsement</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Richard Brown’s review of the rail franchising programme.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent review of the government’s rail franchising strategy, following the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast competition, has backed the overall policy while delivering advice for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin asked Richard Brown, Chairman of Eurostar, to conduct a thorough investigation into how the government should manage its franchising programme following the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast competition last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key conclusions from the Brown review stated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rail industry works, and that there is no credible case for major structural change (paragraph 1.4, p3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;passenger numbers have grown by 92% since privatisation… punctuality and passenger satisfaction are running at much improved levels… it is highly unlikely that these successes could have been delivered if franchising was fundamentally flawed (paragraph 1.5, p3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we have now had nearly two decades’ experience of franchising and therefore a good idea as to what has worked and what still needs to be addressed (paragraph 1.6, p4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brown’s report, published by the department today, recommends that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the department’s capability should be strengthened to manage future franchising programmes (paragraph 1.12, p8)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the bidding and evaluation process for each franchise should be strengthened and simplified (paragraph 3.13, p23)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plans should be put in place to devolve more English franchises to the relevant authorities (paragraph 5.5, p37)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Brown said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In carrying out this review I have come to the conclusion that the franchising system is not broken, but rather it has made a major contribution to Britain’s increasingly successful rail network. It is therefore essential for both passengers and the wider rail market that the franchising programme is restarted as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To achieve this goal, my review has identified a series of practical proposals and recommendations which, if implemented, will result in a stronger and more effective approach to franchising. In addition, I have provided the department with three broad options for them to consider where a strengthened franchising organisation might be located. As set out in both my review and the Laidlaw Report, the department must look to strengthen its franchising capability as a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Passengers cannot wait whilst theoretical discussions are held about the structure of railways. It is essential to get on with the franchising programme in order to maintain the momentum of investment in increasing capacity and improving services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick McLoughlin said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The review has confirmed that government’s approach to rail franchising system is still the best way to secure the rail services for tax payers and fare payers alike. It has identified a number of detailed improvements, which I will carefully consider before publishing a further statement regarding the government’s franchising policy in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Any delays to the franchising programme will not affect services for rail passengers and they will continue to receive the services they depend upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brown review was launched by the Department for Transport in October and follows work conducted by Sam Laidlaw, Chief Executive of Centrica and a non-executive DfT board member into what went wrong with the West Coast competition directly. His report was published in December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review has recommended that by February the government should publish its plans for the Essex Thameside; Great Western; and the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise competitions which were put on hold last October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government considers that, until those plans had been agreed, it would be inappropriate to publish the specific recommendations about these three competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is planning to set out a programme for future franchise competitions in the spring alongside a further statement of franchising policy in light of the Brown Review and the Transport Select Committee’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/rail-2020/"&gt;Rail 2020 report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="latest-data"&gt;Latest data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisional data show that 81.9% of journeys made on Highways Agency managed roads between December 2011 and November 2012 were ‘on time’. This is 0.4 percentage points lower than the previous rolling year, ending in October 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During November 2012, provisional data show that 76.6% of journeys on Highways Agency’s motorway and ‘A’ road network were ‘on time’. This is 4.7 percentage points lower than the equivalent figure for November 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The annual reliability measure consistently increased up to March 2012, but has fallen in the last eight months, and is now at a similar level to that observed in mid-2011. 2012 was the second wettest year since records began with substantial rainfall during the final three quarters of the year. Significant amounts of rainfall compared to 2011 will have led to slower speeds on the network, slower journeys and thus a fall in reliability.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background-information"&gt;Background information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicator monitors the reliability of journeys made on Highways Agency’s motorway and A road network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indicator is measured by the percentage of ‘journeys’ on these roads that are ‘on time’. For this measure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a ‘journey’ represents travel between adjacent junctions on the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an ‘on time journey’ is defined as one which is completed within a set reference time, drawn from historic data on that particular section of road&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reference journey times are updated for the April data each year - further information on the impact of updating reference times can be found in section 3 of the latest &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/road-congestion-and-reliability-statistics"&gt;statistical release&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, information about the reliability of journeys on individual routes, or between particular junctions on the network, are not sufficiently robust to be presented as official statistics. This is due to the range of different sources used to calculate journey times across the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department has been working with the Highways Agency to address these issues of comparability. As a result we will be making a number of methodological changes to improve the quality of the reliability measure from the publication of the January 2013 statistics (in March). More detail on these changes will be provided in updated technical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journey time reliability data for individual road sections is currently published by the Highways Agency through the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk"&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rail franchising</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Richard Brown’s review of the rail franchising programme.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I took the decision last October to cancel the competition for the InterCity West Coast rail franchise and to put the wider franchising process on hold, I commissioned two independent reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am today laying before the House the second of these, by Richard Brown, the Chairman of Eurostar and a highly respected industry figure. His report sets out his recommendations on how best to get the franchising programme back on course. I welcome this report, and am grateful to Mr Brown and his team for their swift and thorough consideration of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/government/publications/the-brown-review-of-the-rail-franchising-programme"&gt;The Brown review of the rail franchising programme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brown concludes that franchising is a fundamentally sound approach for securing the passenger railway services on which so many people rely.  He has identified a number of detailed recommendations for improving the way that franchises are specified and franchise competitions are run. The issues he has identified deserve, and will get, very careful consideration. His recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the franchising programme should be restarted as soon as possible, but at a pace that both the department and the industry can sustain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that franchise term should be determined by the circumstances and size of each individual franchise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;proposals to strengthen and simplify the bidding and evaluation process for each franchise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;proposals for the financial and contractual structure of future franchises, including in relation to risk allocation and capital requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that the government should plan to devolve responsibility for further English franchises to the relevant authorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brown also makes recommendations on how to strengthen my department’s capability to manage the future franchising programme, echoing the findings of Sam Laidlaw’s independent inquiry into the lessons to be learnt from the InterCity West Coast competition.  My department has already published a response to Mr Laidlaw’s report, setting out a series of actions that will allow it to resume the franchising programme, with the confidence of the rail industry, as soon as possible.  The Permanent Secretary has now appointed a single director-general with responsibility for rail, including franchising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review recommends that the government should determine, by February, our plans for the three franchise competitions which I put on hold last October.  I accept that recommendation, and I will update the House when I have determined those plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, however, I consider that it would be inappropriate to publish Mr Brown’s specific recommendations about these three franchise competitions because of their stock market sensitivity, and so I have redacted the relevant paragraphs from the version of the report I have published today.  I will publish the redacted paragraphs once I have decided the way forward for those three competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Brown also recommends that we should set out a clear programme for future franchise competitions.  I will do so in the Spring, alongside a further statement of the government’s rail franchising policy in light of Mr Brown’s recommendations and the Transport Select Committee’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/rail-2020/"&gt;Rail 2020&lt;/a&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stopping up and diversion orders: reform of the application process for local highways</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This consultation details proposals to simplify the process of applying for the stopping up and diversion of a highway.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the ‘Penfold review’, this consultation details proposals to simplify the process of applying for the stopping up and diversion of a highway where this is required for the purpose of property development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose to permit applications for a stopping-up or diversion order to be submitted at the same time as applying for planning permission for the proposed development (whereas under the existing legislation the developer can only apply after securing planning permission), and options for devolving decision-making to the local authority level.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Implementation of the Penfold Review</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Proposals to simplify the process of stopping up or diverting a highway will be announced in a consultation response today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am publishing a government response to the consultation that closed on 24 August detailing proposals to simplify the process of applying for the stopping up or diversion of a highway, where this is required for the purposes of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main options presented in the consultation were to permit applications for a stopping up or diversion order to be submitted at the same time as applying for planning permission and to devolve decision-making to the local authority level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has decided not to devolve the stopping up and diversion order process to a local level. Consultation responses suggested that any devolution should be accompanied by a charging regime; additional costs and charges would be borne by both local authorities and those making applications, with no guarantee of a simpler or faster process. The government does not feel that placing additional burdens on local authorities and costs on developers is right at this time. And the government is aware that the speed of processing applications for stopping up or diversion orders has increased considerably in the last year. Additionally, we do not propose to reform or encourage a greater use of section 116 of the Highways Act 1980.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government continues to support the first option, to allow stopping up and diversion applications to be made alongside planning applications. The government considers this will remove a significant barrier to growth, by speeding up the process and allowing a reduction of burdens on both applicants and local authorities, as both applications can be considered concurrently. Legislation currently in Parliament, as part of the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, will give effect to this measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government response will be available in the libraries of both Houses and on the &lt;a href="/government/consultations/stopping-up-and-diversion-orders-reform-of-the-application-process-for-local-highways"&gt;department’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
