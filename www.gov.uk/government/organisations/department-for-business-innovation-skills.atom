    <title>Licence types: FAQs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are exporting controlled goods outside the UK, there are a number of different licences you can use, issued by the Export Control Organisation (&lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;). These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/open-general-licences-an-overview"&gt;Open General Licences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/european-union-general-export-authorisations"&gt;European Union General Export Authorisations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/standard-individual-export-licences"&gt;Standard Individual Export Licences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/open-individual-export-licences"&gt;Open Individual Export Licences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide explains the answers to commonly asked questions about applying for and using these different types of licences. For more details about each licence type, please refer to the relevant guidance pages directly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="open-general-licences-faqs"&gt;Open General Licences: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some frequently asked questions about registering to use Open General Licences (OGLs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-register-for-ogls"&gt;How do I register for OGLs?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login"&gt;apply for an export licence using SPIRE.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After logging into SPIRE, you need to select the option for ‘new application’ and then from the list of licensing types, select ‘&lt;abbr title="Open General Licences"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt;/EU GEA’. You will then see a drop down box from which you need to select the appropriate licence you need to register for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before registering you need to ensure that you can meet all of the licence terms and conditions. To check conditions you should use &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Open General Export Licence"&gt;OGEL&lt;/abbr&gt; Checker on the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; Checker tools website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="do-i-have-to-wait-for-you-to-acknowledge-my-ogl-registration-before-i-can-use-the-licence"&gt;Do I have to wait for you to acknowledge my &lt;abbr title="Open General Licences"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt; registration before I can use the licence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally you should wait to receive an acknowledgement letter via your SPIRE workbasket confirming your registration since this will include the unique SPIRE reference number confirming your &lt;abbr title="Open General Licences"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt; registration, which you need to quote on any customs documentation, such as in Box 44 of the CHIEF declaration screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an overview of registering for OGLs, see the page in the guide on registering for Open General Licences. You can also access further guidance about exactly how to register on SPIRE for an &lt;abbr title="Open General Licences"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/docs/RegisterOGLs.pdf"&gt;Download &lt;abbr title="Open General Licences"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt; registration guidance from the SPIRE website (DOC, 680K).&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology"&gt;compliance and enforcement of export controls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="is-theeugeneral-export-authorisation-an-ogl"&gt;Is the EU General Export Authorisation an &lt;abbr title="Open General Licences"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An EU GEA is the European Union equivalent of an &lt;abbr title="Open General Licences"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt;. The EU currently publishes six EU GEAs. For more information see the guides on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/controls-on-dual-use-goods"&gt;controls on dual-use goods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/european-union-general-export-authorisations"&gt;European Union General Export Authorisation (EU GEAa)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="standard-individual-export-licences-siels-faqs"&gt;Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs): FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section answers common queries raised at export control seminars about SIELs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="can-siels-be-issued-quicker-than-20-working-days"&gt;Can SIELs be issued quicker than 20 working days?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes licences may be issued quicker but this will depend on the goods and the destination. Processing of licences for sanctioned or highly sensitive destinations is likely to take significantly longer than the standard 20 working day target. To determine the current licence processing timescales by destination you are advised to access the &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/sdb/SDBHOME"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; Reports and Statistics website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve your chances of a licence being issued within the target time or sooner, you need to ensure that your application includes  full technical specifications and remember to attach appropriate &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/end-user-and-consignee-undertakings-for-siels-and-oiels"&gt;end-user documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Any missing information or incomplete details will risk in &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; sending you a request for further information (RFI) via SPIRE with consequent delays in processing your application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the guides on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/submitting-export-licence-applications-correctly"&gt;submitting export licence applications correctly&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-control-licensing-process-and-how-to-appeal"&gt;export control licensing process and how to appeal&lt;/a&gt; which includes details of &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s performance in meeting licence processing targets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="can-the-quantity-stated-on-a-siel-application-be-for-more-than-is-required-at-the-time-of-the-application"&gt;Can the quantity stated on a &lt;abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences"&gt;SIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; application be for more than is required at the time of the application?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it must match the information provided in the &lt;abbr title="End User Undertakings"&gt;EUU&lt;/abbr&gt; and it must be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further information, see the guide: &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/end-user-and-consignee-undertakings-for-siels-and-oiels"&gt;end-user and stockist undertakings for SIELs and consignee undertakings for &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences"&gt;OIELs&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="can-a-licence-be-amended-once-it-is-issued"&gt;Can a licence be amended once it is issued?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export licences are not transferable and may not be altered except by the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some minor changes can be made by &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; in case of a change of company name or address. If either an exporter’s or consignee’s name and address change then you need to notify &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-have-i-received-a-no-licence-required-nlr-letter-in-response-to-my-application"&gt;Why have I received a No Licence Required (&lt;abbr title="No Licence Required"&gt;NLR&lt;/abbr&gt;) letter in response to my application?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you definitely know your goods are not listed on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-and-import-licences-for-controlled-goods-and-trading-with-certain-countries"&gt;UK Strategic Export Control Lists&lt;/a&gt;, then you should only apply for a licence if you have concerns over the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the guides on  &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes"&gt;Military End-Use Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weapons-of-mass-destruction-wmd-end-use-control"&gt;Weapons of Mass Destruction End-Use Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; provides a service called the End-User Advice Service which is available via &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk"&gt;SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;. For more details please refer to guidance about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence"&gt;strategic exports: when to request an export licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-long-are-nlr-letters-valid-for"&gt;How long are &lt;abbr title="No Licence Required"&gt;NLR&lt;/abbr&gt; letters valid for?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no validity date given on &lt;abbr title="No Licence Required"&gt;NLR&lt;/abbr&gt; letters - they represent the opinion of &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; at the time they are given. However, they do expect exporters to keep up to date with changes to the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the guide about the: &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items"&gt;UK Strategic Export Control List&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For regular news and updates about changes to export control licences and legislation, you should &lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Notices to Exporters.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="can-the-original-siel-be-used-to-return-items-that-have-been-sent-back-to-repair"&gt;Can the original &lt;abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences"&gt;SIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; be used to return items that have been sent back to repair?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, provided there is sufficient quantity left on the licence. However, doing this may mean you cannot fulfil the original order if the licence becomes exhausted before you ship the quantity you originally intended. If the licence has been exhausted or the quantity remaining is insufficient, then no, you cannot use the original licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you should consider the relevant repair Open General Export Licence (&lt;abbr title="Open General Export Licence"&gt;OGEL&lt;/abbr&gt;) - that may suit your purpose and if so you should use that licence. If not, and you need to use a &lt;abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences"&gt;SIEL&lt;/abbr&gt;, and you may have to think about applying for an additional &lt;abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences"&gt;SIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; to ensure you can fulfil the order after the first &lt;abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences"&gt;SIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; is exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dual-use-open-general-export-licences-explained"&gt;Dual-Use Open General Export Licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="open-individual-export-licences---faqs"&gt;Open Individual Export Licences - FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section answers common queries raised at export control seminars about &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences"&gt;OIELs&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="under-what-circumstances-will-an-oiel-be-issued"&gt;Under what circumstances will an &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; be issued?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; is a concessionary form of licence, which are issued in certain circumstances. The &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; usually look for a minimum of 20 Standard Individual Export Licence applications per year. They will, however, also consider applications if there is a business case detailing why an &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; is the most appropriate licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-get-an-oiel"&gt;How long does it take to get an &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; aims to process 60 per cent of &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; applications within 60 working days. You should expect a timescale of three to six months for an &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; to be issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="can-an-oiel-be-amended-to-include-additional-goods-or-destinations"&gt;Can an &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; be amended to include additional goods or destinations?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. You would need to apply for a new &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; to incorporate both the existing and new goods and/or destinations. When the new &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; has been re-issued, &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; will cancel the old one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="can-an-oiel-application-be-made-before-all-consignee-or-end-user-details-are-known"&gt;Can an &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; application be made before all consignee or end-user details are known?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. If you are applying for an &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence"&gt;OIEL&lt;/abbr&gt; then you are not required to obtain consignee or end-user details up front at the time of application. You will however need to obtain the details within a month of receiving the goods. You will need to keep and produce originals (not copies) of the required documentation for compliance audits. You will also need to ensure that the undertaking is not out of date when the shipment is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further information, see the guide: &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/end-user-and-consignee-undertakings-for-siels-and-oiels"&gt;end-user and stockist undertakings for SIELs and consignee undertakings for &lt;abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences"&gt;OIELs&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Licensing of controlled goods: FAQs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide addresses some frequently asked questions raised in export control training seminars about how to determine whether your goods are controlled by the Export Control Organisation (&lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide should be read in conjunction with further guidance about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence"&gt;strategic exports: when to request an export licence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="rating-your-goods"&gt;Rating your goods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listed below are some common queries raised at Export Control Organisation (&lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;) seminars about the ‘rating’ or classification of military and dual-use goods and about &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s advisory services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ‘rating’ or ‘control list entry heading’ refers to whether items are listed on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items"&gt;UK Strategic Export Control Lists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; offers a service - called the Control List Classification Advice Service - available throught SPIRE, the export licensing database, which allows exporters to seek advice on whether an item is listed on the Control Lists. For those exporters who already know that their items are not listed then a further service - the End-User Advice Service is also available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk"&gt;Make either a Control List Classification or End-User Advice Service request using SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the ‘rating’ depend on the destination country or identity of the end-user?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, no, although certain goods are controlled only when exported to a certain country (such as &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/sanctions-on-iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;). The identity of the end-user comes into play under End-Use Controls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the ‘rating’ depend on the actual end-use of the goods?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, it is purely based on the specification of the goods in question. However, even where goods are not normally controlled, they can be made licensable, where there are either &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weapons-of-mass-destruction-wmd-end-use-control"&gt;Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) End-Use Control&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes"&gt;Military End-Use Control&lt;/a&gt; concerns. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why can we only have four items on a rating enquiry?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is simply a resource issue.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What items require an export licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should refer to the guide on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items"&gt;UK Strategic Export Control Lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items.&lt;/a&gt;. You should also be aware that items might also require a licence under either the End-Use Controls or because of &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/imports-exports/embargoes-and-sanctions"&gt;embargoes and sanctions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we determine if the products are controlled?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can check the control lists and identify how to self-rate your own goods - &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence"&gt;strategic exports: when to request an export licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk"&gt;use the Goods Checker on the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; Checker website (registration required)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login"&gt;use the Control List Classification Search Tool on SPIRE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The UK Trade Tariff only provides a broad initial indication of whether some goods are restricted. You should not use the Tariff as your unique reference point to determine if your goods are controlled but should check the Control Lists themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is best to check whether your items are controlled as early as possible and build this into your management processes. This may be well in advance of any specific enquiry or order and can be at the design or development stage of a new product. For further best practice advice you can download the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; Compliance Code of Practice document - refer to guidance on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology"&gt;compliance and enforcement of export controls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For military goods, you should also be aware of the MOD F680 procedures on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/mod-f680-applications"&gt;MOD F680 applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a company makes their own ‘rating’ decision and that turns out to be wrong are we liable?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. You are advised to take out insurance against this happening and speak to your insurer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if I have a specific export order to fulfil and am unsure about whether the goods require a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have confirmed business and envisage an export in the near future then it is best that you apply for a licence. &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; will decide whether to grant a licence, refuse it, or say if it is not required.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In each instance, the final licence response will advise you of the status of your goods. If you are advised that no licence is required then you should use the End-User Advice Service for future queries relating to shipments to specific end-users of non-listed goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are components on the Control Lists always controlled?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should check the wording of control entries very carefully since some entries include all specially designed components (including most of the Military List) while others include only those components listed and some do not control components at all.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For more information, refer to the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items"&gt;UK Strategic Export Control Lists.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does ‘specially designed or modified for military use’ mean?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means the original design intent of the goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does painting an item green make it ‘modified’ for military use?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the paint used is standard, plain green paint then no. If the paint has been modified in some way - for instance, to make it infra-red reflective - then yes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are dual-use goods?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are goods that have both military and dual-use applications.
*See more information in the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/controls-on-dual-use-goods"&gt;controls on dual-use goods&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the product you are looking to export you might be able to use an Open General Licence (OGL) or a European Union General Export Authorisation (EU GEA) which provides licensing coverage for specific dual-use goods being exported to less restricted destinations. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For more information, see the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/dual-use-open-general-export-licences-explained"&gt;Dual-Use Open General Export Licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if we don’t know what the items were originally designed for, for instance if they were designed a long time ago, or if the manufacturer has ceased to exist?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to do your own due diligence and make an informed decision on the knowledge that you possess at the time. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If in doubt, contact the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login"&gt;make either a Control List Classification Advice Service request or apply for a licence using SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If my product is not described on the Control Lists does that mean a licence is not required?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. There might be either Military or Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) End-Use Controls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What sort of details do I need to provide to get End-User Advice?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to provide details of who you are, your UK address and the identity and address of any overseas entities that you are dealing with. You do not need to provide details of the goods that you are intending to export.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Your request for end-user advice needs to be completed online via &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login"&gt;SPIRE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will I be able to get a ‘No Licence Required’ letter related to my request for a technical assessment via the Control List Classification Advice Service?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. The previous Ratings Service is now discontinued and we no longer issue old style ‘No Licence required’ letters.  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But my bank or insurer demands that I get an NLR style letter before they release payment. What can I do?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not correct. Organisations representing banks and the insurance industry have been advised of the current procedures. If banks make these demands upon you then refer them to this guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What sort of details will exporters have to present to HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (&lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt;)?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; require a range of general documentation for exports and their requirements are not affected by the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s advisory service procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the Control List Classification Advice has confirmed that you need a licence, you will need to apply for one.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; has advised you that your goods are not listed then you should ensure that you include this notification in the package of documents that you put before &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; to accompany the export. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If, in addition, you have sought End-User Advice and &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; has confirmed that it has no concerns with the named entities then you need to also include this notification.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The important aspect is to demonstrate to &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; that you have taken appropriate steps.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;18. &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; has issued end user advice saying that it has no concerns with my goods. However, the goods still get stopped at customs. Why?
* &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; do checks based on their own intelligence and risk assessment.This process is entirely independent of exporters seeking &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; advice. It is only at the frontier that we have the possibility of checking that goods exported match those that have been declared.
* If &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; decide to detain an export then the process of clearing should run more smoothy if you have all the right documents together, as set out above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long is End-User advice valid for?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End-User advice is valid at the time it is given but it can change in the future because information about companies changes from day to day. The nearer the advice is given to the date of export the greater the likelihood that it remains valid.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does End-User Advice consitute a legal ‘inform’?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not in the usual sense but if exporters are advised to get a licence in response to a request for End-User Advice they may well be deemed to have suspicions about end use which would require them to apply for licences.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; provided End-User Advice relate to advice provided by HM Treasury in relation to financial sanctions?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advice provided by the Treasury in relation to financial sanctions is totally independent of the advice provided by the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; in relation to export control related sanctions and end users. You will have to comply with all relevant sanctions that apply to your business.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How often are the Control Lists updated?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-non-proliferation-and-arms-control-regimes"&gt;international non-proliferation and arms control regimes&lt;/a&gt; are recognised forums of like-minded countries who meet and discuss changes to the Control Lists throughout the year. Depending on the particular regime this is generally achieved by plenary sessions once a year and additional working groups. Any resulting and agreed changes are fed into one major change to the Control Lists. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To keep informed about changes to the Control Lists, you should &lt;a rel="external" href="http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Notices to Exporters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Specific export controls: FAQs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, export control requirements apply when you trade in a number of different types of goods, and in many different situations. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goods that have a military end-use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;goods that can be used for capital punishment or torture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;military goods passing from one third country to another&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;controlled goods that are passing through the UK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;information and technology already in the public domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sting sticks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide contains answers to frequently asked questions relating to these licensing situations. For further information about each of these issues you should read the relevant related guides. For a high level overview about export controls, read about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/beginners-guide-to-export-controls"&gt;export controls: an introductory guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="military-end-use-control-faqs"&gt;Military End-Use Control: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides a list of questions asked at exporter seminars about the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes"&gt;Military End-Use Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will I be informed that I require an export licence because of the Military End-Use Control?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normally, you would be told by the Export Control Organisation (&lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;) by telephone, email, fax or letter.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can I challenge a decision to apply for the Military End-Use Control?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. If you believe the assessment is wrong, you should ask for it to be reconsidered. Your reasons should be clearly supported.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I have been informed that an export may be controlled under the Military End-Use Control, must I apply for a licence if I still intend to export?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I am aware that the export meets, or may meet, any of the above criteria, should I apply for a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the regulation you are required to inform the authorities so that they can decide whether to make the export subject to an authorisation (export licence). If they do, the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; will inform you accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do I apply for a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the same way as for any export licence. See the guide on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-control-licensing-process-and-how-to-appeal"&gt;export control licensing process and how to appeal&lt;/a&gt;.
All licence applications should be made via the SPIRE licensing system. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login"&gt;apply for an export licence using SPIRE.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; informs me that no licence is required, does that advice apply to all exports of those items to that destination?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s advice would apply to that export only.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What happens after I apply for a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; will process the licence application in the usual way. It will be checked to ensure it has been completed fully and correctly and that the necessary technical specifications and documentation on End-Use and end-user have been supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; and their advisers will then consider the application and, because you would not have applied for a licence unless you had been informed or were aware of the possible or intended Military End-Use of the export in question, they will give it particular scrutiny. The &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; will consider your licence application in the light of the information you provide and any other information available to them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Am I likely to get a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A licence is likely to be refused if - after detailed assessment - there is judged to be a risk that either the proposed export of dual-use items not otherwise subject to control is or may be intended, in its entirety or in part, for incorporation into military items listed in the military list of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states, for its development, production or maintenance, or for use in a plant for producing it, and the destination is subject to an arms embargo decided by a common position or joint action adopted by the Council; a decision of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe; or an arms embargo imposed by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The licence is also likely to be refused if there is judged to be a risk that the proposed export of Dual-Use items is intended for use as parts or components of military items listed in the military list of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state that have been exported from that member state without authorisation, whatever the destination&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But what, if after being told we do not need a licence, the items are stopped at the port?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (&lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt;) have responsibility for the enforcement of export controls and may wish to check whether any items that are to be exported require a licence. If you applied for a licence but were advised that no licence was required, you must inform &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt;. You should quote your &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; or licence application reference number or include with your export documentation a copy of the letter stating that the items do not appear to require a licence.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; still believe that there may be grounds for suspicion, they will seek advice from the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;. If the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; find that there are sufficient concerns about the destination or End-Use, appropriate action will be taken, depending on the circumstances. This might include informing you that you should apply for a licence under the Military End-Use Control.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So, for example, if I am exporting civil vehicle parts to Pakistan which will be incorporated into something military, which will then be supplied to Uzbekistan (a country embargoed by the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, but not by Pakistan), will I need a UK export licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. If the immediate destination of your goods wishes to supply a destination subject to a UK-observed embargo that is a matter for them. If you are aware or are informed, however, that your goods are intended to ultimately be supplied as part of an item described in the UK Military List to a destination subject to an embargo observed by the UK you would require a UK export licence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if I’m uncertain about how the law applies in a particular case?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If in doubt, seek expert technical and legal advice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="eu-torture-regulation-scope-of-goods-faqs"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Torture Regulation scope of goods: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some frequently asked questions about the scope of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_200/l_20020050730en00010019.pdf"&gt;&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulation on Products used for Capital Punishment and Torture (the Torture Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;, as amended. Further guidance is available in the related guide about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/controls-on-torture-goods"&gt;controls on torture goods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the Regulation weaken national export control restrictions?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scope of the controls in the Regulation is generally greater than the former UK controls. For instance, there are now controls on gallows and guillotines, electric chairs, air-tight vaults, thumb cuffs and thumb screws. The Regulation raises the level of export control across Europe as many member states previously had no controls in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why was it necessary to remove national controls once the Regulation entered into force?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competence on the export of goods listed in the Regulation now rests with the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. As the Regulation is directly applicable in all &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states, overlapping national legislation was revoked. This does not reduce the level of control, but simply ensures that &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and national legislation mesh together properly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why can’t we simply add extra torture equipment to our national legislation where this is identified as not covered by the Regulation?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Regulation is now the prime source of European controls on the export of goods used for capital punishment or torture. To be most effective, agreement to control the export of such goods should be sought from all the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The list of controlled goods is very limited, there must be many items which can be used for capital punishment or torture and are not listed. Will member states be able to introduce a wider range of military, security and police equipment into the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Trade Regulation?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list of goods in the Regulation was proposed by the European Commission and negotiated with the member states in the Council. The preamble (23) in the Regulation indicates that the list of goods in the Regulation should be kept under review and Articles 12 and 15 set out the procedures for making changes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The UK works with other &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states to introduce additional equipment for control under the Regulation where appropriate and necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will the national control on electric shock dart guns be maintained?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. The government will maintain its controls on exports on electric shock dart guns to all destinations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By deleting PL5001.g from national controls and relying instead on the more restricted definition contained in the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Trade Regulation, will some electro-shock devices cease to be controlled, eg electro-shock devices which operate at a voltage level below 10,000 volts?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reference to no-load voltage exceeding 10,000 volts relates to electric shock dart guns. All electric shock dart guns, whether with a no-load voltage, above or below 10,000 volts, will continue to be controlled in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will export controls on ‘ordinary handcuffs’ be added to the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Trade Regulation?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Regulation is now the prime source of control for handcuffs with the exception of the derogation for handcuffs between 240 and 280 millimetres. It is now for the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; to decide on any changes to the Regulation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will UK national controls on individual cuffs, controlled under PL5001c.5, be maintained, and will the UK encourage the European Commission and &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states to include this equipment description in Annex III of the Trade Regulation?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The control in the Regulation applies to individual cuffs irrespective of size and goes further than the PL5001.c 5 control, which is limited by the internal dimensions of the cuffs. Therefore, it is unnecessary to maintain the national control.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the UK government consider that having leg-irons or leg-cuffs in Annex III in the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Trade Regulation contradicts UK support for Article 33 of the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners in relation to the use, and export, of leg-irons or leg-cuffs?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This point was considered during the negotiation of the Regulation. Article 7(1) of the Regulation allows member states to maintain national prohibition on these goods. The UK will maintain a national prohibition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="eu-torture-regulation-trade-controls-and-other-licensing-situations-faqs"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Torture Regulation trade controls and other licensing situations: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some frequently asked questions about trade controls and other aspects of licensing under the 
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_200/l_20020050730en00010019.pdf"&gt;&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulation on Products used for Capital Punishment and Torture (the ‘Torture’ Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="trade-controls"&gt;Trade controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the Regulation now in force are the existing controls on trafficking and brokering (trade) of ‘torture equipment’ maintained?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. The Regulation does not control trade, but the provisions on trade controls in the Export Control Order 2008 are applied to the goods controlled by the Regulation, as well as maintaining all existing national trade controls. Therefore, a trade licence will be required before trafficking and brokering can be carried out.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will the UK be working to introduce effective brokering controls across the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UK supports brokering controls, and continues to apply national trade controls to equipment in the Regulation and encourage other &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states to do the same.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will the UK government use the options in the Regulation to ensure that the strict export controls introduced in July 1997 and brokering controls implemented in April 2004 are retained?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. The Regulation allows member states to impose stricter controls on the goods which are specified in Articles 7(1) and (2). Article 7(1) allows member states to maintain a prohibition on the export of leg-irons, gang chains and portable electric shock devices. Article 7(2) allows member states to impose an authorisation requirement on the export of handcuffs exceeding 240 millimetres when locked. The UK will apply these provisions.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The Regulation does not control brokering but the UK will continue to apply trade controls as explained above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id="other-licensing-situations"&gt;Other licensing situations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about controls on intra-&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; transfers?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now there is a harmonised regime on exports from the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, there is no need in principle for controls on transfers to other member states. However, they are maintained in certain cases where the UK has tougher controls than the Regulation or to maintain previous national controls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why does the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulation only apply to non-&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with all &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; export regulations, the Torture Regulation only deals with external trade to and from the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What about transhipment controls?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Regulation controls the transhipment in and out of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; of goods listed in Annex II of the Regulation. For goods in Annex III where transhipment controls currently exist in the UK, these will be maintained where this is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Could the lack of transit controls be in breach of &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member states’ obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transit controls apply in respect of goods in Annex II. For goods listed in Article 7(1) national transhipment controls can be maintained. The UK will continue to maintain transit controls on Article 7(1) goods, ie leg-irons, gang-chains and portable electric shock devices.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; Trade Regulation control technical assistance whereby person(s) supply such assistance once they have travelled outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; territory?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical assistance controls apply (see Articles 3 and 4 of the Regulation) to those Annex II goods prohibited for import and export.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="trade-controls-trafficking-and-brokering-of-military-goods-faqs"&gt;Trade Controls (Trafficking and Brokering) of military goods: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the trade controls?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trade means trafficking and brokering of military goods, in other words, the UK involvement in deals which result in the movement of military goods from one third country to another.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For more information, see our page on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-controls-military-goods-on-trade-fairs-and-exhibitions"&gt;current guidance on trade in military goods&lt;/a&gt; in the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-controls-on-controlled-military-goods"&gt;trafficking and brokering (trade controls)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we have a trade licence in place for a certain deal, will we still need to obtain an export licence from the source destination for the goods to leave that country?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if we are arranging for technology for military goods to be moved from one third country to another?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trade controls do not apply to software or technology, unless it relates to ‘restricted goods’ or movement to an embargoed destination as ‘any act calculated to promote…’ would probably include the transferral of related technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="transit-or-transhipment-goods-faqs"&gt;Transit or transhipment goods: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some frequently asked questions about licensing requirements for goods transiting the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you mean by transit/transhipment?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that goods are passing through the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I need a licence for goods in transit/being transhipped?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This varies. Most controlled goods do not need a licence provided certain conditions are met. There are also a number of exceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;See more information on transhipment licences in the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/transit-and-transhipment"&gt;transit and transhipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if software is added to the goods when they arrive in the UK?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then work will be done on the goods, they will have been imported into the UK and an export licence will be needed to export the goods from the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-export-of-technology-faqs"&gt;The export of technology: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a selection of common questions which are often raised at the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s exporter seminars and workshops. See also further guidance about the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-of-technology"&gt;export of technology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you explain what you mean by ‘technology’?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Technology’ is information relating to goods and software. For example, blueprints, plans, diagrams, models, formulae, tables, designs, specifications, manuals and instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is all technology controlled?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except in certain cases, technology is only controlled if it is required for the development, production or use of listed goods or software, or if the technology itself is specifically described in the UK Strategic Export Control Lists. See the guide on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items"&gt;UK strategic export control lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;‘Required’, ‘development’, ‘production’ and ‘use’ are themselves defined terms which need to be understood in order to determine whether a piece of ‘information’ is controlled. In addition, there are exemptions for technology ‘in the public domain’, which is ‘basic scientific research’ or is the minimum necessary for making patent applications.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What happens if the technology can be used both for licensable and No Licence Required (NLR) goods?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the technology is capable of being ‘required’ for licensable goods, then a licence will be needed, even if it is being exported or transferred in connection with NLR goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can technology be transferred?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology can be transferred by physical means, such as posting or hand-carrying a document overseas, or by carrying a laptop or memory device on which the technology is stored.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It can also be transferred by electronic means such as email, fax, file downloads and transfers, or by remote access from overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I therefore need to apply for a licence every time I want to send an email?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. A licence is issued to cover a project or series of transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does a telephone conversation constitute a transfer of technology?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only if you are reading out a document word for word and it is being transcribed at the other end.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is an export licence required when I place information on a server in the UK if the information is going to be accessed from overseas?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, since it involves the act of being accessed overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to place data on a server which is physically located overseas but the data will only be accessed by UK-based employees. Do I need an export licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can ensure that information is not accessed from outside the UK (including by system administrators), then you would not need a licence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I require an export licence for information which is in my head?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does providing a service such as repair, training or consultancy constitute technology transfer?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No. This is known as Technical Assistance. However, if a service engineer takes documentation overseas in servicing goods or technology then the documentation would be licensable. You would need to consider this aspect if using technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When do we need to have licences to transfer technology within the UK?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the technology meets the definition of ‘any relevant use’ and is going to be used for that purpose outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, a licence will be needed to transfer the technology within the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does the &lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; control electronic transfers?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Export Control Organisation"&gt;ECO&lt;/abbr&gt; expects companies to demonstrate compliance. Whilst it is hard to police this and prove when an electronic transfer is made, emails can be tracked and examined. &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; will use intelligence reports to identify those not complying with the controls. Essentially, if the technology needs a licence to be exported or transferred, get a licence in place and ensure full compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You should be aware that you risk prosecution - either a fine or a jail sentence - along with attendance of loss of business reputation - for misuse of technology. For further information see the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology"&gt;compliance and enforcement of export controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do licences for technology have a time limit?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only Open General Licence (&lt;abbr title="Open General Licence"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt;) that has a time limit is the remote access &lt;abbr title="Open General Licence"&gt;OGL&lt;/abbr&gt;. See the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-goods-ogels"&gt;Military Goods Open General Export Licences&lt;/a&gt;. Those using it have to be out of the country for a period of time of less than three months. Open Individual Licences are usually valid for up to five years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does ‘in the public domain’ mean?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the public domain means the information is made available without any restrictions, other than copyright, being placed on further dissemination. For instance, information you place on your website that anyone can download or that you publish in a sales brochure would be ‘in the public domain’.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;However, if the information has a security classification or you require a non-disclosure agreement to be in place before you share it or if there are any other intellectual property restrictions, then the information is clearly not in the public domain.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a drawing is ‘in the public domain’, but the goods it refers to are licensable, does the drawing need a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, technology ‘in the public domain’ does not need a licence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The information needed to design our type of product is all available in text books. Surely then our technology is in the public domain? 
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only if your specific technology is freely available without restriction is it considered to be in the public domain. The availability of generic information or of similar information from other sources is irrelevant. You would need a licence in both cases.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our product contains software which is open source. Does that mean our product does not need a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The answer to both questions is the same.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="public-domain-faqs"&gt;Public domain: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some frequently asked questions about information said to be in the public domain. See also guidance about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-control-legislation-for-uk-academics-and-researchers"&gt;export control legislation for UK academics and researchers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does ‘in the public domain’ mean?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘In the public domain’ means the information is made available without any restrictions, other than copyright, being placed on further dissemination. For instance, information you place on your website that anyone can download or that you publish in a sales brochure would be ‘in the public domain’.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;However, if the information has a security classification or you require a non-disclosure agreement to be in place before you share it or if there are any other intellectual property restrictions, then the information is clearly not in the public domain.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a drawing is ‘in the public domain’, but the goods it refers to are licensable, does the drawing need a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, technology ‘in the public domain’ does not need a licence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The information needed to design our type of product is all available in text books. Surely then our technology is in the public domain?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You still need a licence. Only if your specific technology is freely available without restriction is it considered to be in the public domain. The availability of generic information or of similar information from other sources is irrelevant. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our product contains software which is open source. Does that mean our product does not need a licence?
    &lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="sting-sticks-faqs"&gt;Sting sticks: FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some frequently asked questions about sting sticks (which are specific goods used for torture). See also guidance about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/controls-on-torture-goods"&gt;controls on torture goods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a ‘sting stick’?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purpose of these controls a ‘sting stick’ is any type of hand-held, spiked baton.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why has the government decided to introduce controls on the export and trading of so called sting sticks?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090902183635/berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/europeandtrade/strategic-export-control/legislation/export-control-act-2002/review/index.html"&gt;review of export control legislation 2007&lt;/a&gt;, which included an extensive public consultation exercise, the government made a commitment in its initial response to the views and recommendations it received to extend the current export and trade controls to cover sting sticks.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The government considers that sting sticks are, by their nature, designed for the purposes of torture or similar inhumane acts and have no other legitimate use. Therefore, the government believes that, in common with other equipment of a similar nature, the UK should apply the most stringent level of controls on the export and trading of sting sticks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will there be new controls on the import and domestic possession of sting sticks?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controls on the import and domestic possession of sting sticks will not be introduced as part of this amendment. However, the government will consider whether an import prohibition should be introduced on sting sticks in due course.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do these controls apply extraterritorially?
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes. These controls apply to the export of sting sticks from the UK and the trading of sting sticks between one third country and another third country, where any part of that trading takes place within the UK, or where it takes place anywhere in the world if carried out by a UK person.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Making companies more accountable to shareholders and the public</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shareholders and the public have lost confidence in the way companies are run and they believe that companies should be rewarded for success not failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making companies more accountable in how they work - and showing that they are improving - will increase investor and public confidence, making them more attractive to investors and giving the public more trust in their products and services.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make companies more accountable to their shareholders and the public, the government is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-companies-more-accountable-to-shareholders-and-the-public/supporting-pages/improving-company-reporting"&gt;improving company reporting&lt;/a&gt; through a new law which changes how they write their reports&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;bringing in legislation that &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-companies-more-accountable-to-shareholders-and-the-public/supporting-pages/giving-shareholders-more-power-to-link-pay-to-performance"&gt;gives shareholders more power to link pay to performance&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing a national contact point at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (&lt;abbr title="Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development"&gt;OECD&lt;/abbr&gt;) where people or organisations can report UK multinationals they think may be breaking the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-companies-more-accountable-to-shareholders-and-the-public"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development"&gt;OECD&lt;/abbr&gt; guidelines for trading abroad&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Reporting Council’s (&lt;abbr title="Financial reporting Council"&gt;FRC&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code.aspx"&gt;UK Corporate Governance Code&lt;/a&gt;, launched in 2010, sets out good principles for running a company board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Financial reporting Council"&gt;FRC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance/UK-Stewardship-Code.aspx"&gt;UK Stewardship Code&lt;/a&gt; makes investors more answerable to their clients and beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Financial reporting Council"&gt;FRC&lt;/abbr&gt; have a detailed explanation about why they are improving these codes and how they fit into government regulation in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.frc.org.uk/getattachment/1db9539d-9176-4546-91ee-828b7fd087a8/The-UK-Approach-to-Corporate-Governance.aspx"&gt;UK approach to corporate governance.&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2012 Kay Review of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-law/docs/k/12-917-kay-review-of-equity-markets-final-report.pdf"&gt;Equity markets and long-term decision making&lt;/a&gt; Professor Kay examines how to improve the performance of UK companies, and provide returns to savers. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121205150610/http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-law/corporate-governance/kay-review"&gt;See the full background on the review, including responses to the call for evidence and the consultation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 22 November 2012 the government published its response &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=bis%20ensuring%20equity%20markets%20support%20long%20time%20growth&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.gov.uk%2Fassets%2Fbiscore%2Fbusiness-law%2Fdocs%2Fe%2F12-1188-equity-markets-support-growth-response-to-kay-review.pdf&amp;amp;ei=Q6a_UIfZFZTM0AW414GIAQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFKxfouDderH7bnrYUmF_gWKCDeZQ"&gt;Ensuring equity markets support long-term growth&lt;/a&gt; welcoming the Kay Report and accepting Professor Kay’s analysis and conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New figures show government is winning war on red tape</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business will benefit from nearly £1 billion in reduced red tape costs thanks to Government action, independent figures revealed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fifth Statement of New Regulation reports that the overall closing balance for ‘One-in, One-out’, the Government rule that dictates that every new cost on business must be balanced by an equivalent saving, is predicted to be around £836 million since January 2011. These figures are independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the statement shows that the Government expects to reduce the regulatory burden by around a further £83 million between January 2013 - when ‘One-in, One-Out’ is replaced by ‘One-in, Two-out’ - and June 2013.  Expected measures include reforms to environmental regulation, employment law and consumer law.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said that Whitehall is increasingly putting the needs of businesses centre stage, but vowed to go further and faster to roll back barriers to growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every department is predicting either a zero balance or being in credit at the start of One-in, Two-out, showing that the de-regulatory agenda is having an impact right across Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that the overwhelming majority of Government measures affecting business are deregulatory, with only ten new items imposing new costs on business compared with 89 that will save money or will impose a zero net cost. The costs from the ‘ins’ (£6 million) are also dwarfed by the savings from the ‘outs’ (£89 million), giving a predicted net saving to business of £83 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent deregulatory measures include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes to modernise and simplify the registration of company charges, saving £21.9 million.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A series of changes to building regulations to reduce cost and complexity for industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less heavy-handed Health and Safety regulations for low-risk businesses including shop and offices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to speed up processes covering adoption and foster-carer eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government has a very simple objective: to make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business.  This requires a fundamental culture change in Whitehall, so that new regulation is only imposed as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve made a promising start, but firms still struggle with excessive red tape.  We’ll now push departments to go further to bear down on costs imposed on business, and we’ll fight harder to get EU bureaucracy off the back of our entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time this Statement sets out EU measures that will be introduced during the reporting period, giving businesses time to prepare for these changes.   Fifty-seven EU measures are expected to be implemented into UK legislation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every six months the government publishes a Statement of New Regulation listing of all the regulations it plans to introduce and remove in the next six months, and showing the net direct costs to business. The Fifth Statement of New Regulation is available &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-impact-of-regulation-on-business/supporting-pages/operating-a-one-in-two-out-rule-for-business-regulation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ‘One-in, One-out’ rule was introduced on 1 September 2010 and applies to regulations introduced from January 2011.  The rule prevents any government department introducing new regulation that will impose a direct net cost on business and voluntary organisations - unless the department can find savings by removing or modifying another regulation of an equivalent cost. ‘One-in, Two-out’ will also operate in this way, but the removal or modification must be of twice the equivalent cost. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like ‘One-in, One-out’ , ‘One-in, Two-Out’ will not apply to EU legislation unless it has been converted into UK law in a way that goes beyond minimum EU requirements, putting UK businesses at a disadvantage.  A number of other areas are exempt from the rule, including tax administration and civil emergencies regulation. More detail is available &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-impact-of-regulation-on-business"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When developing a new regulatory or deregulatory proposal, each Government department must carry out an impact assessment. This includes estimating the likely cost to business. To ensure estimates are credible, the impact assessment is considered by an independent body, the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Red Tape Challenge is systematically examining some 6,500 substantive regulations that the Government inherited, with the aim of scrapping or significantly reducing as many of them as possible. It gives business and the public the chance to have their say, by theme, on the regulations that affect their everyday lives. The Government announced on 10 September 2012 that at least 3,000 of the regulations examined will be scrapped or reduced. A second phase of the Red Tape Challenge will start in spring 2013.  More information on the Red Tape Challenge is avaiable &lt;a href="www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alongside the drive to remove superfluous regulation, Government is working to ensure that necessary regulations on business are enforced more efficiently. Focus on Enforcement reviews are being carried out across a number of sectors where aspects of the enforcement regime may be imposing unnecessary burdens on business, making inefficient use of public sector resources or hampering economic growth.  At Autumn Statement, the Government also announced a number of measures to tackle systemic issues, including the lack of consistent fees and charges and appeals mechanisms. The Focus on Enforcement website is available &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/iscuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Cable announces step change to turn ideas into growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at The Big Innovation Centre, Dr Cable launched a range of measures that will improve services to business, strengthen enforcement, and help consumers get the most out of creative products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plans, which will involve a step change in the way the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) delivers services, include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;launching a superfast patent processing service to deliver patents in just 90 days and a faster trade marks examination service which will deliver a full examination report in five days, instead of 10;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a campaign to educate smaller businesses about getting the best value from their creativity and innovation;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;action to help consumers and young people understand the importance of respect for IP and the harm counterfeiting or illegal downloading can do; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with key partners, such as the City of London Police, to tackle IP  crime such  as counterfeiting and online piracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new measures, which will come into effect next year, aim to encourage and help businesses get the best value from their ideas and boost growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new measures, which will come into effect next year, aim to encourage and help businesses get the best value from their ideas and boost growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPO will also expand the way it operates, moving beyond just granting rights and do more to support businesses in understanding the opportunities available to them at home and abroad. This will include piloting an IP advisory service for small and medium businesses with high-growth potential. The IPO will work more closely with organisations where businesses already go for advice such as trade associations, UKTI, chambers of commerce, banks and accountants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our creativity, our openness to and talent for innovation, is a key pillar of our return to robust growth. So it is right we work to create the environment in which creative, innovative businesses of all shapes and sizes flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A vital part of this is making sure the intellectual property landscape encourages and cements success and growth. The new vision for how we support businesses and consumers is central to achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure consumers are protected from counterfeiters and better understand the use and value of intellectual property is also key. A new national consumer campaign will be launched in the Spring to help raise awareness about counterfeiting and piracy and ensure that the rights of creators and innovators are better enforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity will in particular focus on young people, reaching out to them in schools, theme parks and on the web, to educate them about their responsibilities in downloading materials and also protecting their own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be further strengthening of the IPO’s IP attaché network which places a business attaché in challenging overseas markets to help British businesses and encourage improvements to the nation’s IP environment. In 2013, a new attaché will be placed in Singapore to serve South Asian markets, supporting those already in place in China, India and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK will host an enforcement summit next summer inviting countries from around the world to share best practice and work together to combat problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-for-editors"&gt;Notes for editors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Business Secretary is seting out his vision for developing the UK’s intellectual property landscape to encourage growth and a renewed programme of action for the Intellectual Property Office. Dr Cable is speaking at The Big Innovation Space at 9.00am on Monday 17 December at The Big Innovation Centre, 21 Palmer Street, London SW1H 0AD.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) is part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and is responsible for the national framework of Intellectual Property rights, comprising patents, designs, trade marks and copyright.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IPO’s role is to help manage an IP system that encourages innovation and creativity, balances the needs of consumers and users, promotes strong and competitive markets and is the foundation of the knowledge-based economy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IPO operates in a national and an international environment and its work is governed by national and international law, including various international treaties relating to Intellectual Property (IP) to which the United Kingdom is a party.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:

    <title>Reducing the impact of regulation on business</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some regulations are ineffective and unnecessary. Complying with them costs businesses time and money, and can restrict growth. Red tape can also make running charities and community groups more difficult than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to ensure all regulations are fair and effective. We want to strike the right balance between protecting people’s rights, health and safety and freeing them from unnecessary bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure regulations in the UK are fair and effective, we are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;controlling the number of new regulations by &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-impact-of-regulation-on-business/supporting-pages/operating-a-one-in-two-out-rule-for-business-regulation"&gt;operating a ‘one in, two out’ rule for business regulation&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We publish &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;keywords=&amp;amp;publication_filter_option=guidance&amp;amp;topics%5B%5D=all&amp;amp;departments%5B%5D=department-for-business-innovation-skills"&gt;guidance for all government policymakers&lt;/a&gt; to help design better regulations or find other options instead of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, regulations - and the inspections and bureaucracy that go with them - have piled up. Businesses say the amount of new regulation is one of their biggest problems, preventing them from growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf"&gt;coalition agreement&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2010, we said that we would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cut red tape for businesses and individuals &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not rely on rules and regulations by themselves to get things done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-were-consulting-with"&gt;Who we’re consulting with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re running a series of reviews called ‘Focus on enforcement’ to get businesses’ views on how we could improve the way we enforce regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/"&gt;Have your say on how we enforce regulations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also running the Red Tape Challenge, asking businesses and the public which regulations they think could be removed or improved. See what businesses are saying: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Tell us which regulations you think should be removed or improved.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
