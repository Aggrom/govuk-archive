    <title>Get started with Companies House filings for agents</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many agents and advisers set up and file documents on behalf of companies. If you are about to start filing company documents such as accounts and annual returns with Companies House, this guide will help you to understand what you need to do and where to go for more help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide will also introduce you to some of the useful online tools and resources that make filing faster and simpler. These include Companies House Software, WebFiling and the search facility WebCHeck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="companies-house-annual-return-for-agents"&gt;Companies House annual return for agents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company must send an annual return to Companies House each year. It provides important company information, in a prescribed format, which is then made available to the public. Annual returns must be sent to Companies House by a specific ‘made up’ date - usually the anniversary of the company’s date of incorporation or the anniversary of the last annual return filed at Companies House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about the annual return in our guide: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1081986989&amp;amp;r.l2=1087252345&amp;amp;r.l3=1087442424&amp;amp;r.l4=1085030976&amp;amp;topicId=1073869071"&gt;Companies House annual return&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="companies-house-annual-accounts-guidance-for-agents"&gt;Companies House annual accounts guidance for agents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All companies, both private and public, must keep accounting records. Limited companies and limited liability partnerships must send a copy of their annual accounts to Companies House each year. Most companies use professional firms of accountants to produce their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you produce and file accounts on behalf of a company, you must ensure they are signed or authenticated by the accountants (if appropriate) and the company’s directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about what information is needed and how to submit it in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1081986989&amp;amp;r.l2=1087252345&amp;amp;r.l3=1087442424&amp;amp;r.l4=1085030976&amp;amp;topicId=1073859917"&gt;filing accounts with Companies House: dates and checklist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="submitting-documents-to-companies-house"&gt;Submitting documents to Companies House&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are delivering statutory information to Companies House on behalf of your clients, the most secure way is to use their electronic and online filing services. You can read more about this on the page in this guide about &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1085037698&amp;amp;r.l1=1081986989&amp;amp;r.l2=1087252345&amp;amp;r.l3=1087442424&amp;amp;r.l4=1085030976&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;using Companies House electronic and online services&lt;/a&gt;. Although you need to register for this, the process is straightforward and free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out which forms can be filed electronically and online, and a list of filing exceptions see our page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/openpopup?itemId=1082022100&amp;amp;r.i=1085037135&amp;amp;r.l1=1081986989&amp;amp;r.l2=1087252345&amp;amp;r.l3=1087442424&amp;amp;r.l4=1085030976&amp;amp;r.t=RESOURCES&amp;amp;type=ONEOFFPAGE"&gt;WebFiling forms and exceptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also deliver documents by post, courier, Document Exchange Service or Legal Post (in Scotland), and by using software from a number of commercial software suppliers. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/online/internet-filing-index.htm"&gt;Find commercial filing software information on the HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (HMRC) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will receive an acknowledgement from Companies House, provided you send a copy of your covering letter and a pre-paid addressed return envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="using-companies-house-electronic-and-online-services"&gt;Using Companies House electronic and online services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save you time and expense, Companies House provides two electronic and online filing services - Software Filing and WebFiling. The Companies House WebCHeck service also allows you to search the company names index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="web-incorporation-service"&gt;Web incorporation service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can incorporate a company yourself online. To do this &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086687162&amp;amp;r.l1=1081986989&amp;amp;r.l2=1087252345&amp;amp;r.l3=1087442424&amp;amp;r.l4=1085030976&amp;amp;type=PIP"&gt;use the Companies House web incorporation service&lt;/a&gt;. This service currently can only be used to incorporate a private company limited by shares adopting model articles in their entirety with a proposed non-sensitive name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="software-filing"&gt;Software filing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This service allows external companies to develop software packages to manage the submission of a range of forms and documents required by Companies House. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/efilingfaq.shtml"&gt;Find out about the Software Filing service on the Companies House website&lt;/a&gt;. You can also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/toolsToHelp/efSoftwareSupp.shtml"&gt;access a list of software suppliers and formation agents on the Companies House website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="webfiling"&gt;WebFiling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a safe and reliable way to file company information online. Most information can be filed free of charge, so it also saves money for your clients. The service can also be used seven days a week, 24 hours a day, so it is also very convenient. You can find out more information in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1081986989&amp;amp;r.l2=1087252345&amp;amp;r.l3=1087442424&amp;amp;r.l4=1085030976&amp;amp;topicId=1082194051"&gt;how to use WebFiling to file company information online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japanese knotweed, giant hogweed and other invasive plants</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several hundred invasive plants in the UK. Japanese knotweed, giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam are invasive plants that your business might come into contact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must not plant invasive plants intentionally and if you have invasive plants on your property you must not allow them to spread off site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasive non-native plants can cause problems for native UK species and reduce biodiversity (the variety of living organisms). Invasive non-native species are now widely recognised as the second biggest threat to biodiversity worldwide. Japanese knotweed can block footpaths and damage concrete, tarmac, flood defences and the stability of river banks. Giant hogweed can cause harm to human health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Injurious weeds are native species, which cause problems for farming. They are harmful to livestock and must not be allowed to spread to agricultural land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide describes how to identify and control invasive plants using methods such as spraying, digging up, cutting and burning. You will find details of your legal responsibility for dealing with invasive plants and how to remove and dispose of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="your-legal-responsibilities-for-invasive-plants-and-injurious-weeds"&gt;Your legal responsibilities for invasive plants and injurious weeds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invasive non-native plants are species which have been brought into the UK that has the ability to spread causing damage to the environment, the economy, our health and the way we live. Injurious weeds are native species, which have been deemed to cause a problem to farming productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have invasive plants or injurious weeds on your premises you have a responsibility to prevent them spreading into the wild or causing a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must not plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any plant listed on schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/wildlife-countryside-act.pdf"&gt;Download further guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website (PDF, 153K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="invasive-plants"&gt;Invasive plants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have invasive plants on land that you own or occupy, you must comply with specific legal responsibilities, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spraying herbicides - see the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086737527&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;spraying invasive plants with herbicide&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;burning invasive plants - see the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086738241&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;cutting and burning invasive plants&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;burial of soil containing invasive plant material - see the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086738496&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;burying invasive plant material on site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;off-site waste disposal - see the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086738692&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;disposing of invasive plants and contaminated soil off site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not need to notify anyone about the invasive plants on your land. However, you should &lt;a rel="external" href="https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/nonnativespecies/index.cfm?sectionid=81"&gt;report certain non-native species on the Non-native Species Secretariat (NNSS) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/nonnativespecies/downloadDocument.cfm?id=375"&gt;Download a consolidated list of invasive plants from the NNSS website (PDF, 89K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not obliged to remove or treat invasive plants, but you must not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow invasive plants to spread onto adjacent land - the owner of that land could take legal action against you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plant or encourage the spread of invasive plants outside of your property - this can include moving contaminated soil from one place to another or incorrectly handling and transporting contaminated material and plant cuttings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a farmer and receiving the Single Farm Payment, you must not allow an infestation of an invasive non-native species on your land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="injurious-weeds"&gt;Injurious weeds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Injurious weeds are those that are considered able to cause harm to agricultural pasture. The five species of ‘injurious weed’ are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;common ragwort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;spear thistle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creeping or field thistle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;curled dock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;broadleaved dock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any injurious species on your land, you are responsible for controlling them. You must prevent them from spreading onto adjoining land. You could be served with an enforcement notice to make sure you do this and fined if you don’t comply. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-pets/wildlife-management/weeds-act-1959/"&gt;Find details on ragwort and injurious weeds on the Defra website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="identifying-invasive-plants"&gt;Identifying invasive plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that you can identify invasive plants on your premises. This will allow you to manage and deal with them in the most appropriate way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying invasive plants on a site early lets developers assess and cost options for destroying, disposing of and managing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing land infested by invasive plants in a timely and appropriate way can avoid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;excessive cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;potential prosecution and compensation claims&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;physical damage to buildings and hard surfaces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;harm to the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="identifying-japanese-knotweed"&gt;Identifying Japanese knotweed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese knotweed begins to grow in early spring and can grow in any type of soil, no matter how poor. It can grow as much as 20 centimetres per day, and can reach a height of 1.5 metres by May and 3 metres by June. It does not produce viable seeds in the UK, but instead spreads through rhizome (underground root-like stem) fragments and cut stems. Japanese knotweed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;produces fleshy red tinged shoots when it first breaks through the ground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has large, heart or spade-shaped green leaves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has leaves arranged in a zig-zag pattern along the stem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has a hollow stem, like bamboo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can form dense clumps that can be several metres deep&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;produces clusters of cream flowers towards the end of July&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dies back between September and November, leaving brown stems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Knotweed_CoP.pdf"&gt;Download the Japanese knotweed code of practice from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 2.06MB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="identifying-giant-hogweed"&gt;Identifying giant hogweed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should take great care when identifying giant hogweed. Contact with the plant, particularly the sap, can lead to severe blistering and scarring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giant hogweed closely resembles native cow parsley or hogweed. It can take four years to reach its full height of 3-5 metres and flower. Giant hogweed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has a reddish purple stem with fine spines that make it appear furry - like a stinging nettle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has hollow stems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has spotted leaf stalks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has leaves up to 1.5 metres wide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flowers in June and July&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has flower heads that are usually 50 centimetres wide - each flower head is capable of producing 50,000 seeds every year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has seeds that can stay in the soil for several years before they develop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="identifying-himalayan-balsam"&gt;Identifying Himalayan balsam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Himalayan balsam is often found on river banks, growing up to 2 metres in height. Each plant lasts for one year and dies at the end of the growing season. Himalayan balsam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has reddish coloured stems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with jagged edges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flowers from June to October&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has large, brightly coloured flowers that are usually in variable shades from purple to pale pink&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can produce around 2,500 seeds per plant each year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has explosive seed pods that can throw seeds over 6 metres away from the plant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="identifying-other-invasive-plants"&gt;Identifying other invasive plants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other species of invasive plants in the UK include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;floating pennywort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;parrot’s feather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creeping water primrose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Zealand pigmyweed (also known as Australian swamp stonecrop)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;curly waterweed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nuttall’s waterweed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Canadian pondweed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;water fern (also known as fairy fern)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out how to identify some of these invasive weeds, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0410BSBR-e-e.pdf"&gt;download guidance on managing invasive non-native plants from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 581K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/nonnativespecies/index.cfm?sectionid=47"&gt;Find identification sheets on invasive non-native species on the Non-native Species Secretariat (NNSS) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-invasive-plants-spread"&gt;How invasive plants spread&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove invasive plants from your premises or to stop them from spreading, it helps to understand how new plants grow and spread. This will help you decide what action to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you employ a contractor to do the work for you, you should understand what they intend to do and why. This could help you decide what you actually need and could save you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-japanese-knotweed-spreads"&gt;How Japanese knotweed spreads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese knotweed does not spread from seeds in the UK. It is spread when small pieces of the plant or rhizomes (underground root-like stems) are broken off. One piece of rhizome or plant the size of a fingernail can produce a new plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pieces of plant or rhizome can be transported to a new location by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water - if the parent plant is close to a river or stream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving soil which contains them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fly-tipping cut or pulled stems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual plants can cover several square metres of land, joined up below ground by an extensive rhizome network. Herbicide treatment can be a very effective way of controlling Japanese knotweed, but a lack of regrowth does not mean the underground rhizome is dead. If the soil is disturbed, knotweed often regrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-giant-hogweed-spreads"&gt;How giant hogweed spreads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giant hogweed produces large, umbrella-like flowers, each of which can produce up to 50,000 seeds. These seeds fall typically within 4 metres of the parent plant. Seeds can be transported by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vehicles - particularly along roads and railways&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;water - if the parent plant is close to a river or stream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;footwear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving soil which contains them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds can remain dormant in the soil for 15 years. Even if you treat the plants with herbicides and they die, several thousand seeds are waiting in the ground below for the opportunity to take their place. Any control programme needs to continue for several years, including checks for new growth. When managing giant hogweed it is important to maintain a healthy grass sward, either by using selective herbicides or by sowing grass mixes. A dense grass sward helps to prevent giant hogweed seeds from germinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giant hogweed contains sap that is released when the plant is cut or by brushing against the plant. Contact with the sap causes skin to become sensitive to sunlight, resulting in painful blisters which appear up to two days after contact and may reoccur for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-himalayan-balsam-spreads"&gt;How Himalayan balsam spreads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Himalayan balsam plants can produce around 2,500 seeds each year. The seedpods open in such a way that the seeds are thrown up to 7 metres away from the parent plant, helping the species to quickly spread. Seeds can also be transported by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water - if the parent plant is close to a river or stream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tracked vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;footwear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving soil which contains them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you remove these plants, or treat them with herbicides and they die, several hundred seeds can be waiting in the ground below for the opportunity to take their place. The seeds can survive for several years, so any control programme needs to continue for a couple of years, including checks for new growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="handling-and-working-with-invasive-plants"&gt;Handling and working with invasive plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not manage invasive plants correctly, they will spread over time and they could cause damage to structures, such as building foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have invasive plants on your site you should put up signs, where appropriate, to warn employees and the public about the invasive species that are present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put up posters in offices and communal areas to explain to employees what the problems are and what they need to do. Include pictures of the invasive plants you have on your site. This is particularly important for giant hogweed, as contact with sap from the plant can lead to skin burns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="handling-japanese-knotweed"&gt;Handling Japanese knotweed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your staff can identify Japanese knotweed rhizomes (underground root-like stems). This can reduce waste costs and improve how you manage Japanese knotweed on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should minimise the amount of soil containing Japanese knotweed material that you excavate. Soil containing Japanese knotweed material that has been treated can be reused for landscaping the site, but should not be taken off site, unless to landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a choice of herbicides that are effective against Japanese knotweed, depending on your situation. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086737527&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;spraying invasive plants with herbicides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On development sites you should fence Japanese knotweed where possible, using clear signs so that only appropriately briefed personnel enter the enclosure to deal with the infestation and resulting waste. This includes areas with waste plant material or soil contaminated with Japanese knotweed. The fence should be at least 7 metres away from the plants. Put up restricted access signs around these fenced areas (poster available in Appendix VII of the Japanese knotweed code of practice). You must not use tracked vehicles within the affected area, and make sure any vehicles leaving the area are pressure washed. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Knotweed_CoP.pdf"&gt;Download the Japanese knotweed code of practice from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 2.06MB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must never strim areas containing Japanese knotweed. If you are going to clear areas where Japanese knotweed is present, make sure you remove all cut stems. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086738692&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;disposing of invasive plants and contaminated soil off site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not try to compost Japanese knotweed material - it will produce new plants. You must not put cut plant material directly onto the ground. If you must stockpile cut material, make sure it does not come into contact with soil - for example, by placing it on top of a barrier membrane. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086738241&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;cutting and burning invasive plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep soil containing Japanese knotweed material separate from clean soil. This will reduce the volume of soil that you need to treat and dispose of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="handling-giant-hogweed"&gt;Handling giant hogweed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When giant hogweed sap comes into contact with skin, it reacts with sunlight and causes chemical skin burns. Giant hogweed sap becomes more toxic as the year progresses and the plant is exposed to more sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stem and underside of the leaves have hairs like a stinging nettle. Brushing against giant hogweed can be enough to get sap on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have giant hogweed on your premises, you must ensure that the public and your employees are protected from the hazards of its toxic sap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should control giant hogweed before it seeds. You must not use a strimmer on giant hogweed. The sap from the plant may get onto your skin or into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to get close to or handle giant hogweed, you should wear full protective clothing with gloves, a hood and a full-face visor. You should wash down your protective clothing before you take it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get sap on your skin, cover it to keep it out of the sun. Go indoors immediately and wash the sap off your skin with soap and lots of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="spraying-invasive-plants-with-herbicide"&gt;Spraying invasive plants with herbicide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treating invasive plants with herbicide can be a very effective method of treatment. You will have to respray. It usually takes at least three years to treat Japanese knotweed until it is dormant. Giant hogweed seeds can continue germinating for 15 years after the last seed fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the plant is in or near to water you must have agreement from the Environment Agency to use the herbicide. The herbicide must be approved for use in or near water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The herbicide’s effectiveness depends on the type used. An advisor certified by BASIS (the registration, standards and certification scheme for pesticides and fertilisers) will be able to advise you on the most suitable type of herbicide for your situation and when best to apply it. You can also &lt;a rel="external" href="https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/nonnativespecies/index.cfm?sectionid=53"&gt;find management examples and information on the Non-native Species Secretariat (NNSS) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.basis-reg.co.uk"&gt;Find information on pesticide and fertiliser registration, standards and certification on the BASIS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam both drop large quantities of seeds. A control programme will need to continue for several years, with checks carried out throughout the growing season. If you are trying to eradicate these plants from a riverbank it is important to ensure that any plants upstream are also treated to avoid seeds being washed onto the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese knotweed has a large underground network of rhizomes (underground root-like stems). To eradicate the plant you must kill the rhizomes. Picking the right herbicide is essential, as it must travel through the plant and into the rhizome system below. Several herbicides can treat Japanese knotweed successfully - you will need to pick the right herbicide for your situation. Glyphosate is effective because it penetrates through the whole plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="using-herbicides"&gt;Using herbicides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person doing the spraying must hold a certificate of technical competence for herbicide use or work under the direct supervision of a certificate holder. If you plan to spray in or near water, the person carrying out or supervising the spraying must have the appropriate aquatic part of the qualification. The sprayer must also comply with the pesticide product label and meet all of its conditions. Before you spray in or near water you must check that the product is approved for use near water. There are formulations of glyphosate and 2.4-D amine that can be used in or near water and are effective against many invasive plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a certificate of technical competence by attending a short course at an agricultural college or similar institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For herbicide to be effective, make sure you use it at the correct time of year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese knotweed is best sprayed in late summer from flowering onwards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giant hogweed should be sprayed in April or May, before the plants flower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Himalayan balsam should be sprayed in spring before flowering, but strimming or hand pulling should be your preferred option for control of this plant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must follow the guidance in the statutory code of practice for plant protection products. If you follow its advice you should stay within the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/safe_use.asp?id=64"&gt;Read the code of practice for plant protection products on the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive (HSE) Chemicals Regulation Directorate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the invasive plants are near a watercourse, you should not use herbicides as the first option. If you are planning to use herbicide in or near to a watercourse, you must complete herbicide form AqHerb01 and send it to the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0110BRZI-e-e.pdf"&gt;Download form AqHerb01 - agreement to use herbicides in or near water from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 499K)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0110BRZK-E-e.pdf"&gt;Download guidance notes for form AqHerb01 from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 326K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also carry out a Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) assessment for any activities that involve herbicides. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/index.htm"&gt;Read about COSHH on the HSE website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dispose-of-waste-herbicides-correctly"&gt;Dispose of waste herbicides correctly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must make sure that all your waste is stored, transported and disposed of safely. Waste herbicides are likely to be classed as hazardous waste. You must keep this separate from other waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herbicide containers must either be rinsed or handled as herbicides. Check product labels to see if your waste containers should be rinsed. Water used for rinsing empty containers is classed as dilute pesticides or biocides. You may need an environmental permit, registered waste exemption or trade effluent consent to dispose of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;topicId=1086778448"&gt;pesticides and biocides - your environmental responsibilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="digging-up-invasive-plants"&gt;Digging up invasive plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearing the leaves and stems of Japanese knotweed or giant hogweed that are above ground and then removing soil contaminated with roots, rhizomes (underground root-like stems) and seeds can provide faster results than just spraying with herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to minimise the amount of waste you generate that contains invasive plants, or their seeds and rhizomes. Any waste you do produce should be treated on site where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any waste that is taken off site must be taken by a licensed waste carrier and must go to a suitably authorised landfill site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you intend to bury invasive plant waste on your property you must contact the Environment Agency to check you are allowed to do this at your location. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086738496&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;burying invasive plant material on site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should not remove soil from river banks, as this can cause water pollution. If you are planning to carry out work near a river you should contact the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your site floods, the seeds will be spread further across the site, so you will need to manage a larger area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="digging-up-giant-hogweed"&gt;Digging up giant hogweed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clear ground contaminated with giant hogweed, you may need to remove soil up to 4 metres away from the plants and to a depth of 0.5 metres. You will need to check for regrowth regularly. You should spray regrowth with the herbicide glyphosate before the plants flower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="digging-up-japanese-knotweed"&gt;Digging up Japanese knotweed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rhizome system beneath a stand of Japanese knotweed can be over 4 metres deep and could extend for at least 7 metres around the stand. If you are going to dig out the rhizome system you will need to remove all of the plant material. You should use the rhizome identification guide in the knotweed code of practice, or ask a specialist, to help you identify the plant material. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Knotweed_CoP.pdf"&gt;Download the Japanese knotweed code of practice from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 2.06MB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to check any cleared areas regularly for regrowth. You can spray any regrowth with herbicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="digging-up-himalayan-balsam"&gt;Digging up Himalayan balsam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clear ground contaminated with Himalayan balsam, you may need to remove soil up to 6 metres from the parent plant and to a depth of 0.5 metres. You should not remove soil while the seed pods are present. You will need to check for regrowth regularly. You should pull by hand or strim regrowth before the plants flower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as seeds remain viable in the soil for several years, annual cutting, mowing or grazing or annual herbicide treatment during the spring growing season can be an effective control for this plant. You must also carry out follow up checks for late germinating seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-you-must-do-when-digging-up-invasive-plants"&gt;What you must do when digging up invasive plants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never stockpile contaminated soil or plant material within 10 metres of a watercourse, and it should not be stockpiled within 7 metres of your site boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect any water you use for cleaning vehicles that are used in contaminated areas. If it is contaminated with seeds or plant material, you must not discharge it to a watercourse. You could treat the water by passing it through a settlement tank to remove any soil before passing it through a very fine mesh sieve to remove seeds or plant material. Settlement alone may not be adequate because seeds and plant material float. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0307BMDX-e-e.pdf"&gt;Download Pollution prevention guideline: Vehicle washing and cleaning (PPG13) from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 176K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to deposit material sieved from water used for vehicle washing in a controlled area on your land and monitor it for regrowth. You should speak to the Environment Agency to determine your best option. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/contactus/default.aspx"&gt;Find Environment Agency contact details on the Environment Agency website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guides on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;topicId=1080374134"&gt;preventing water pollution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;topicId=1086676178"&gt;discharging trade effluent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-for-digging-up-invasive-plants"&gt;Good practice for digging up invasive plants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should clearly mark out any areas of your land that contain invasive plants. Fence them off until you intend to clear them. Put the fence at least 7 metres away from the plants to contain any contaminated soil or roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you clear contaminated areas, take care to ensure contaminated soil, seeds and plant material are not spread to unaffected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limit the use of tracked machinery where possible. Seeds and plant material can get caught in the tracks and moved around the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are developing your land, consider creating a haul road using a strong geotextile overlain with hardcore as a base for vehicles to travel on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover all lorries, dumpers or haulage vehicles carrying contaminated soil or plant material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly clean tracked machinery when it leaves contaminated areas of the site. Do this within a designated area that is as close as possible to the contaminated area on which the machinery has been working. Always carry out a visual inspection of wheel arches and tracks before the vehicle leaves the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out for regrowth by roads and areas where vehicles have been parked or cleaned. Spray any regrowth with herbicide if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working between November and March in an area where invasive plants are known to be present, look for dead canes from the previous year to identify infected areas. Even if there is no growth evident above ground, seeds from giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam, and Japanese knotweed rhizome will still be present. Try to inspect a development site for evidence of invasive species before it is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cutting-and-burning-invasive-plants"&gt;Cutting and burning invasive plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting down or digging up invasive plants and burning the waste plant material can be a useful, low-tech means of control. It can reduce the volume of waste that you need to dispose of off site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cutting-invasive-plants"&gt;Cutting invasive plants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting Japanese knotweed will, over time, weaken the plant, but it will not kill the rhizomes (underground root-like stems). It can be used as part of other control practices. You must handle and dispose of cut plant material carefully. Burning alone may not be sufficient to kill the plant material. You should place burnt material on top of a membrane and monitor it for regrowth. You must not use a strimmer on Japanese knotweed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting giant hogweed before the plants flower will help to prevent further seeds being deposited on the ground. This is an effective way of removing these species but it can take many years. You must not use a strimmer on giant hogweed. You must avoid contact with giant hogweed, particularly its sap, as it can cause chemical skin burns. You should wear full protective clothing when working near it or handling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling up Himalayan balsam before the plants flower is the most effective method of control. Do not cut the plants before they flower as this can result in a more bushy plant that produces more flowers. The best time to cut is late May. Cut the plant below the first nodule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="burning-invasive-plants"&gt;Burning invasive plants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning waste materials is a type of waste disposal. If you burn waste in the open you may require an environmental permit or registered waste exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had a waste exemption registered before 6 April 2010, you may need to register a new exemption from environmental permitting or apply for an environmental permit. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/Table_of_transitional_provisions_-_only.pdf"&gt;Download an exemption and permit timetable from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 62K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may qualify for a D7 exemption to burn certain waste plant tissue and untreated wood if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;burn the waste at the place where it was produced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;burn no more than 10 tonnes in a 24-hour period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an exemption, you must comply with the exemption conditions and register this exemption with the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also ensure that your activity does not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;endanger human health or cause pollution to water, air or soil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;constitute a risk to plants or animals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cause a nuisance, eg in terms of noise or odour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adversely affect the countryside or places of special interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/116165.aspx"&gt;Find guidance on the waste exemption for burning waste in the open on the Environment Agency website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must notify the Environment Agency at least a week before you intend burning plant material. You should also notify your local authority environmental health officer before you begin burning plant material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you burn waste in an incinerator or other similar plant, you may need an environmental permit. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;topicId=1086913916"&gt;burning waste - your environmental responsibilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burning plant material should only give rise to white smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell the local fire brigade before you begin burning and again when you finish, so that they are not called out unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can leave cut stems to dry out in the sun rather than burning them. Make sure you place cut Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam material on a membrane and not in direct contact with the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giant hogweed sap remains toxic after the plant has been cut down. Do not leave cut stems where they could harm people or livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="burying-invasive-plant-material-on-site"&gt;Burying invasive plant material on site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking plant material and soil containing plant material away for disposal off site uses valuable landfill capacity and increases the likelihood of the spread of invasive plants. Another option is to bury this soil and plant material on your own land because, without sunlight, plants cannot survive and seeds will not germinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this material will need to remain buried for several years to ensure that it will not grow again. Giant hogweed seeds can be viable for up to 15 years and Japanese knotweed rhizome (underground root-like stems) is believed to survive for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-you-must-do"&gt;What you must do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you bury invasive plant waste on your property you must contact the Environment Agency to check you are allowed to do this at your location. The Environment Agency may want to look at your site and may visit while the works are undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil and plant material containing Japanese knotweed may need to be buried 5 metres below ground level. You should place a barrier membrane on top of the material and fill the hole with clean soil. Alternatively, the knotweed code of practice describes how you can bury it less deeply. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Knotweed_CoP.pdf"&gt;Download the Japanese knotweed code of practice from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 2.06MB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil containing Himalayan balsam and giant hogweed seeds should be buried at least 1 metre below ground level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must not bury anything other than plant material and soil containing invasive plants that have originated on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must make sure that deep burial does not interfere with the ground water level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buried soil and plant material that have been treated with a herbicide that does not break down in the environment could cause groundwater pollution. If you intend to bury treated material, you should treat it with glyphosate herbicide only. Check with the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herbicides that do not break down in the environment are described as persistent. Those that do break down are described as biodegradable or non-persistent. The herbicide packaging or safety data sheet will state whether it is persistent or non-persistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soil contaminated with some persistent herbicides will be classed as hazardous and so will need to be disposed of as hazardous waste. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;topicId=1080466581"&gt;managing your hazardous waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must follow the guidelines for spraying plants with herbicide and digging up plants. See the pages in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086737527&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;spraying invasive plants with herbicide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086737854&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1082900123&amp;amp;r.l3=1086726920&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;digging up invasive plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-1"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should bury the material in an area where it is not likely to be disturbed. You should keep records of the quantity of material that you have buried and a map showing the location of the burial pit and its depth. Use signs to mark the burial pit and keep heavy tracked machinery off the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should not bury materials deeply within 7 metres of an adjacent landowner’s site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="disposing-of-invasive-plants-and-contaminated-soil-off-site"&gt;Disposing of invasive plants and contaminated soil off site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try to minimise the amount of waste you generate that contains invasive plants or their seeds, roots and rhizomes (underground root-like stems). Any waste you do produce should be treated on site where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any waste taken off site must be taken by a licensed waste carrier and go to a suitably authorised landfill site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-you-must-do-1"&gt;What you must do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you transport invasive plants and soil contaminated with invasive plants, make sure that the vehicle is covered or sheeted so that seeds and plant material cannot blow away. If you allow contaminated soil or plant material to escape, you could be prosecuted and fined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have waste transfer notes (WTNs) for any material leaving your site. You must list any material that contains invasive plants or their seeds on the WTN. Your waste carrier can only take the waste containing invasive weeds to sites authorised to accept it. Plant material, or soil containing plant material or seeds, is likely to be classed as non-hazardous waste - this is a different category from inert waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a duty of care for waste that affects all businesses. You must make sure that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your waste is stored, handled, recycled or disposed of safely and legally by licensed individuals or businesses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you record all transfers of waste between your business and another business - using a WTN&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you keep all WTNs, signed by both businesses, for at least two years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you record any transfer of hazardous waste between your business and another business using a consignment note&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you keep all consignment notes, signed by both businesses, for at least three years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must take waste plant material or contaminated soil to a site that has an environmental permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions of the permit must allow the disposal of invasive plants at the site. You should check with the waste site in advance to make sure they can accept material containing invasive plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waste site may need notice so that an area can be prepared. For example, a landfill site will need an area away from the landfill liner for material containing invasive plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tax-relief-for-disposing-of-soil-containing-japanese-knotweed"&gt;Tax relief for disposing of soil containing Japanese knotweed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed are considered to be pollutants and used to have a landfill tax exemption from HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (HMRC). You can no longer apply for a new exemption, but existing exemptions may be valid until 31 March 2012. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;amp;id=HMCE_CL_000509&amp;amp;propertyType=document&amp;amp;lang=_e"&gt;Read about landfill tax on the HMRC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land remediation relief (LRR) is a corporation tax relief scheme introduced to help bring land that has been ruined by various industrial uses or long-term neglect back into productive use. You may be able to claim LRR for removing contamination arising from Japanese knotweed. You will not be able to claim LRR if disposing of material containing Japanese knotweed to landfill. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD60000.htm"&gt;Find guidance on land remediation relief on the HMRC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="invasive-plants-environmental-legislation"&gt;Invasive plants environmental legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page provides links to the full text of key pieces of environmental legislation relating to invasive weeds. The websites hosting the legislation may list amendments separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are setting up an environmental management system (EMS) for your business, you can use this list to start compiling your legal register. Your legal adviser or environmental consultant will be able to tell you if other environmental legislation applies to your specific business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radioactive materials are used in some industries, including the medical industry and some manufacturing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are legal controls on keeping and using radioactive materials and accumulating and disposing of radioactive waste. These aim to protect people and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business works with radioactive substances you must have an environmental permit or be covered by an exemption. Your permit or the exemption will cover activities such as keeping or using radioactive material and receiving, storing or disposing of radioactive waste. You must comply with the conditions in your environmental permit or exemption as they control the impact your activities have on the environment and human health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is intended for users of radioactive substances on non-nuclear sites. It is not intended for radioactive waste disposal sites, underground storage or disposal facilities, or nuclear licensed sites (such as nuclear power stations). It outlines what radioactive substances are, how to apply for an environmental permit and what you must do to comply with your permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-are-radioactive-substances"&gt;What are radioactive substances?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radioactive substances include radioactive material and radioactive waste. Different legal controls apply to handling radioactive material and dealing with radioactive waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="radioactive-material"&gt;Radioactive material&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radioactive material includes substances or articles that are radioactive, or have become radioactive through non-natural processes, for example at a nuclear reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radioactive materials are used by many organisations. For example, hospitals, research organisations, radiographers and process industries use radioactive materials for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;diagnosing and treating disease&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;controlling industrial processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;preventing static electricity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;industrial radiography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scientific research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different types of radioactive material, including open and sealed radioactive sources, are used for different activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open radioactive sources are radioactive materials that you can easily divide, disperse or dilute. They can be in a liquid, gaseous or sometimes solid form. Open sources include radioactive laboratory chemicals and radiopharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open radioactive sources can potentially contaminate other material through leakage or leaching. You must store all open radioactive sources securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sealed radioactive sources have a structure which prevents radioactive material from leaking during normal use. If you use sealed sources incorrectly you could cause radioactive contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sealed radioactive sources used to be called ‘closed’ sources. They are categorised according to their hazard or risk as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high activity sealed sources (HASS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sources of similar potential hazard to HASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category 5 (low hazard or risk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sealed source may take the form of a welded steel capsule, or a homogenous, laminated, electrodeposited or foil source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HASS present a greater hazard to the environment and human health than other sealed sources. HASS may include sterilisation sources, hospital radiotherapy sources, industrial radiography sources, density and moisture gauges and some industrial process control gauges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/369_05_SD02v6_final.pdf"&gt;Download HASS guidance from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 129K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mobile-radioactive-apparatus"&gt;Mobile radioactive apparatus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile radioactive apparatus includes equipment, appliances or other things that are portable and classed as radioactive material. They may be used for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing, measuring or investigation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;releasing radioactive material into the environment or introducing it into organisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile radioactive apparatus may contain sealed or open radioactive sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have an environmental permit if you use or keep mobile radioactive apparatus, unless you are covered by an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="radioactive-waste"&gt;Radioactive waste&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radioactive waste includes certain substances which would be radioactive material if they were not waste, or substances which have been contaminated by radioactive material or other radioactive waste. It can be in a solid, liquid or gaseous form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radioactive waste may include contaminated clothing that needs to be disposed of, laboratory wastes from the use of open radioactive material or a sealed source which is scrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="environmental-permits-and-exemptions-for-radioactive-substance-activities"&gt;Environmental permits and exemptions for radioactive substance activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have an environmental permit if you carry out a radioactive substances activity including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping or using radioactive material at your premises&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accumulating radioactive waste on your premises&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disposing of radioactive waste on or from your premises&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;receiving radioactive waste for disposal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keeping or using mobile radioactive apparatus for certain purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disposing of radioactive waste includes discharging radioactive waste into the air, land, sea, surface water (such as rivers and lakes) or foul sewers. You are also disposing of radioactive waste if you transfer it to another site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/32481.aspx"&gt;Find radioactive substances guidance on the Environment Agency website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/policy/permits/documents/ep2010radioactive.pdf"&gt;Download environmental permitting guidance on radioactive substances regulation from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website (PDF, 567K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will not need to apply for an environmental permit if you already held a certificate of registration or authorisation on 5 April 2010 and it meets your current needs. This will have automatically become an environmental permit on 6 April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must not carry out a radioactive substances activity before you receive your environmental permit. If you are unsure whether you need an environmental permit for radioactive substances activities, you should contact the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="exemptions-from-environmental-permitting"&gt;Exemptions from environmental permitting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need an environmental permit if an exemption applies to your activities. The exemption specifies the types of premises, materials or waste which do not need a permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you rely on an exemption you are responsible for checking that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exemption applies to your activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can comply with the conditions of the relevant exemption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not need to register your exemption with the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/nuclear/radioactivity/decc/legislation/exempt_review/exempt_review.aspx"&gt;Find information about exemptions on the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact a suitable radiation protection adviser, radioactive waste adviser or the Environment Agency if you are unsure whether your activities are covered by an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="nuclear-site-regulation"&gt;Nuclear site regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance is not intended for radioactive waste disposal sites, underground storage or disposal facilities, or nuclear licensed sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear licensed sites are jointly regulated by the Environment Agency and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) of the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive (HSE). &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/"&gt;Find information about the Nuclear Directorate on the HSE website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/117039.aspx"&gt;Read nuclear industry guidance on the Environment Agency website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="applying-for-an-environmental-permit-for-radioactive-substance-activities"&gt;Applying for an environmental permit for radioactive substance activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of environmental permit for radioactive substance activities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standard rules permits for keeping or using small, non-exempt sealed radioactive sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;permits for other sealed sources, including high activity sealed sources (HASS), sources of a similar level of potential hazard to HASS and sources contained in mobile radioactive apparatus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;permits for open source use and waste storage and disposal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must complete an application form for the type of permit you need and pay an application fee to the Environment Agency. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/117043.aspx"&gt;Find radioactive substance permit application forms on the Environment Agency website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must submit a site plan with your application unless it is for mobile radioactive apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disposing of radioactive waste can be very expensive so make sure that you can afford these costs before you apply for a permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="permits-for-related-water-activities"&gt;Permits for related water activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your radioactive substances permit will also cover water discharge or groundwater activities that result from the operation of your radioactive substances activity. For example, if you have a permit for the disposal of solid radioactive waste to land, your permit will cover both the disposal and any related water discharge or groundwater activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you carry out any other water discharge or groundwater activities that do not result directly from your radioactive substances activities you will be issued with separate environmental permits - one for your radioactive substances activities and one or more for your other regulated facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="complying-with-your-environmental-permit-for-radioactive-substance-activities"&gt;Complying with your environmental permit for radioactive substance activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must comply with the conditions in your environmental permit. Conditions control the impact your radioactive substance activities could have on the environment and human health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency will carry out site inspections, conduct audits and review information it receives about your site to make sure you are complying with your permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be fined, or even sent to prison, if you do not comply with the terms of your environmental permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="comply-with-your-permit-conditions"&gt;Comply with your permit conditions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions in your environmental permit will depend on what radioactive substances activities you carry out at your site. Your permit may contain conditions that relate to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managing your site activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what activities are permitted on your site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operating your site, such as site security and safe storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high activity sealed radioactive sources (HASS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transferring radioactive sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;receiving radioactive waste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accumulating radioactive waste, including accumulation limits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disposing of radioactive waste safely and securely, including appropriate disposal routes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keeping records, reporting and making notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you store radioactive substances the conditions in your permit might require you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prevent unauthorised persons from accessing the radioactive substances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take measures to prevent loss of, theft of or damage to the radioactive substances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maintain the radioactive substances and any associated containers and equipment in good repair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure the radioactive store is labelled clearly and correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your business keeps or uses HASS, disposes of HASS or holds sealed sources with a similar level of potential hazard, your environmental permit will contain additional conditions to protect people and the environment. For example, you must comply with additional site security arrangements. There are also special reporting requirements and additional financial requirements for HASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must display a copy of your environmental permit on your business premises, unless it relates to sealed radioactive sources or it is otherwise subject to national security restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency has issued guidance on how to comply with the conditions in your environmental permit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="how-compliance-is-enforced"&gt;How compliance is enforced&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency has a range of enforcement tools to ensure that businesses comply with environmental permitting legislation. They will take enforcement action that is appropriate for the severity of the non-compliance. Enforcement action includes verbal and written warnings, enforcement notices, suspension notices and prosecution with the possibility of a fine or prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out what other enforcement action the Environment Agency can take, see the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086319110&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1086709576&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;how environmental permitting is enforced&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1086709576&amp;amp;topicId=1086287989"&gt;environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-radioactive-substances-regulation"&gt;Other radioactive substances regulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you handle radioactive substances you may have to comply with other legislation in addition to environmental permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="importing-and-exporting-radioactive-substances"&gt;Importing and exporting radioactive substances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are importing or exporting radioactive materials or waste, you must contact the Environment Agency to find out what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prevent pollution from paper and cardboard production</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper and cardboard industry can cause significant pollution. The industry includes paper and paperboard manufacturers, and businesses that produce paper and paperboard products. It also includes businesses that carry out finishing activities, such as coating, covering, laminating and embossing paper or cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your activities may cause air pollution from dust and fumes, water pollution from contaminated discharges or run-off, noise pollution from materials handling and deliveries to your site, and land contamination from accidental spills of solvents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide describes your responsibilities for preventing pollution to air, land and water. It includes guidance on noise and vibration, cooling towers, vehicle emissions, vehicle cleaning and car parks. It also covers how to prevent and deal with pollution incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="air-pollution-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers"&gt;Air pollution responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper and cardboard businesses can emit dust, smoke, fumes and gases which affect air quality. Emissions to air include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulphur (SOx) and carbon (COx) from combustion plant or liquor burning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;particulates and dust from combustion or paper handling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;formaldehydes and ammonia from wet strength resins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;solvents from cleaning or coating processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chloroform from the use of chlorine compounds in bleaching&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;odorous substances from wet pulping or effluent treatment plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="comply-with-your-permit-conditions"&gt;Comply with your permit conditions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business has an environmental permit, you must meet the conditions it contains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your permit may contain conditions relating to odour and emissions to air, including controls on substances such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;halogens, eg chlorine, fluorine and bromine-containing substances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NOx&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;particulates, eg PM10 and dust&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SOx&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;volatile organic compounds, eg formaldehyde&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use organic solvents, you must comply with further requirements. See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087477121&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;solvent use responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087463934"&gt;waste and hazardous substance responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="avoid-causing-a-nuisance"&gt;Avoid causing a nuisance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must ensure that your activities do not create levels of dust, smoke or odour that could cause a nuisance to the surrounding community. If you do cause a nuisance, your local authority can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impose restrictions on your operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stop your operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;require you to take steps to reduce the nuisance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1086041496"&gt;noise, odour and other nuisances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="meet-boiler-and-chimney-requirements"&gt;Meet boiler and chimney requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you operate a boiler, you are likely to have to meet tight controls on its emissions to air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must not cause or allow a chimney or bonfire on your site to emit dark smoke. There are some exemptions from this requirement, but only if your installation won’t cause emissions that could damage health or cause a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1080460523"&gt;preventing air pollution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="check-for-ozone-depleting-substances-ods-or-fluorinated-gases-f-gases"&gt;Check for ozone-depleting substances (ODS) or fluorinated gases (F-gases)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most circumstances, you must not use ODS for any degreasing or solvent application. ODS include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1,1,1-trichloroethane&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bromochloromethane&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon tetrachloride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;F-gases are powerful gases that contribute to climate change. Common F-gas uses include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in buildings and vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;solvents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;firefighting and fire protection equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your business uses or handles F-gases or equipment that contains them, you must comply with special controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guide on managing fluorinated gases and ozone-depleting substances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce dust, odours and fumes you should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establish systems to monitor, measure, control and minimise dust emissions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;damp down areas of your site that give rise to dust (particularly in dry weather), but don’t allow run-off to enter surface water drains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extract and filter dust-contaminated air during finishing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;install chemical recovery systems to capture chemicals in exhaust gases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use filtered extraction hoods on paper machines to prevent emissions of odorous substances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remove water vapour with a ventilator to prevent emissions of hazardous substances in the water vapour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use low NOx burners if you have combustion plant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;keep covers on chemical containers to prevent odour and stop the escape of potentially harmful vapours and fumes - this may also save you money by reducing loss of materials through evaporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of harmful chemical emissions you should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce the use of bleaching chemicals by extending cooking and oxygen delignification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use brightening techniques that do not dissolve the lignin when bleaching mechanical pulp or recovered mechanical pulp - this will reduce the chemical oxygen demand of water in the manufacturing process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use chlorine-free techniques that do not use sulphur compounds when bleaching chemical or recovered chemical pulp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="noise-pollution-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers"&gt;Noise pollution responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper and cardboard businesses may create noise by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operating large processing plant and machinery, eg compressors, vacuum pumps and ventilators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;moving materials and goods to and from the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using vehicles on the site, especially if they have reversing alarms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your activities can also create vibration. Noise nuisance also covers vibration and both are controlled at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If noise or vibration from your activities causes a nuisance to the surrounding community, your local authority can limit your operations or even stop you from working. They can restrict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the machinery you use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your working hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;noise levels from your premises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a permit or exemption and you breach noise conditions the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you. If you do not address a noise problem you could face legal action and a fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must comply with any noise conditions set out in the planning approval for your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="register-your-burglar-alarms"&gt;Register your burglar alarms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business is located in an alarm notification area you must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;register your burglar alarm with your local authority&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provide the details of a person who holds the keys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure the key holder knows how to use the alarm system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could be fined if you do not register. Contact your local authority to find out if your business is in an alarm notification area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1074537118"&gt;Find contact details for your local authority through our Contacts Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="protect-your-employees-from-loud-noise"&gt;Protect your employees from loud noise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loud noise can cause irreversible hearing damage. You must protect your employees’ hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="check-your-permit-conditions"&gt;Check your permit conditions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an environmental permit or a waste exemption, it may contain conditions that control emissions, such as noise. You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-1"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carry out noisy activities away from areas where noise may cause a nuisance. Position noisy equipment away from your site boundary. You can use existing buildings to shield the noise source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your buildings have adequate soundproofing. Shutting your doors and windows will also reduce noise. Use solid panelled fencing around your site instead of wire fences. This can help to screen the source and reduce the level of noise from your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep external doors and loading bays closed when they are not in use. For example, fit automatic closing devices to help prevent excess noise causing a nuisance to your neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chipping and pulping operations can be extremely noisy. If you carry out these activities you should do so in a section of your building that has adequate soundproofing or acoustic dampening to minimise the impact of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduce noise from your equipment and vehicles by servicing them regularly. Consider fitting noise-reducing devices, and when you replace equipment consider buying quieter alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should regularly monitor noise from your site, when it is fully working and also when it is shut down. This will give you an idea of the impact of your work on noise levels in the surrounding community. Monitoring will also help you identify any change in noise levels. If you are in any doubt about noise levels, you should get advice from a noise expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limit noisy activities to daylight hours as noise is more likely to be a nuisance at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you operate a night shift, move materials into the work area during the day or early evening. This will reduce the risk of complaints from the local community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive a complaint make sure you deal with it properly.

&lt;h2 id="water-and-sewer-discharge-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers"&gt;Water and sewer discharge responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pollute water or cause or risk causing environmental damage to water, you may be committing an offence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your paper and cardboard business may create wastewater or effluent from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;process effluent, eg from de-inking operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;effluent or other treatment plants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;boiler operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cooling processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cleaning operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;site drainage and stormwater run-off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your wastewater or run-off may contain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suspended solids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil and fuels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;acids and alkalis, which affect the pH of the water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;solvents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;softening or brightening agents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;biocides, eg plant protection chemicals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cleaning products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should handle these substances with care at all stages of processing and manufacture as they can pollute surface waters and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="get-permission-to-discharge-to-water-and-sewers"&gt;Get permission to discharge to water and sewers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must get an environmental permit or register an exemption from environmental permitting with the Environment Agency before you discharge anything other than clean, uncontaminated water to surface waters or groundwater. You may also need consent if you need to construct a new outfall structure for your discharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must comply with the conditions of your permit or exemption or you may be prosecuted and fined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have permission from your water and sewerage company before you discharge anything other than clean, uncontaminated water to their drainage system. If you discharge trade effluent to a public foul sewer, you must first have a trade effluent consent or agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087483440&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;water discharge permits for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prevent-environmental-damage"&gt;Prevent environmental damage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water pollution can be classed as environmental damage in some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must prevent and clean up environmental damage that occurs from surface or groundwater pollution caused by your business activities. If anyone else reports environmental damage as a result of your activities, your enforcing authority will have to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the pages in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1086885096"&gt;pollution incidents and environmental damage - an overview&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086889327&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;preventing environmental damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086889030&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;what is environmental damage?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-2"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Store hazardous materials, fuel, oil and chemicals safely and in an area where you can contain spills. This may be a legal requirement if you store oil. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1080454826"&gt;storing oil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should use an impermeable secondary containment system such as a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bunded area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bunded pallet or spill pallet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sump pallet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bunded storage unit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bunded drum store&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;storage cabinet with an integral sump&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your bund and any bunded pallets should be able to contain at least 110 per cent of the volume of the largest tank or 25 per cent of the total volume you are likely to store, whichever is greater. See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087468475&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;fuel and oil use responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087463934"&gt;waste and hazardous substances responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For information on managing your drainage system, see the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1082471091&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;drainage system requirements to avoid pollution&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1080374134"&gt;preventing water pollution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the pollution prevention guidelines (PPGs) to avoid causing pollution. This is particularly important if your business is in an area that has vulnerable groundwater. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/39083.aspx"&gt;Find PPGs on the Environment Agency website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare a pollution incident response procedure for dealing with spills. Make sure that your staff are familiar with the procedure and know how to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087487809&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;pollution incident prevention at paper and cardboard production sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cooling-tower-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers"&gt;Cooling tower responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business has air-conditioned offices or carries out a manufacturing process that uses water as a coolant, you may have a cooling tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooling towers remove heat from circulating cooling water systems, so that the water can be recirculated. The heat removed from the water is released to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="register-your-cooling-tower"&gt;Register your cooling tower&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a cooling tower or an evaporative condenser, you must notify your local authority. You must also tell them if you make any changes to your cooling tower or if you stop using it. Ask your local authority’s environmental health department for a cooling tower registration or notification form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1074537118"&gt;Find contact details for your local authority through our Contacts Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your local authority and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) will carry out regular inspections to ensure that your cooling tower meets safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="check-if-you-need-a-permit-licence-or-exemption"&gt;Check if you need a permit, licence or exemption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your cooling tower is part of a large installation you may need an environmental permit. If you are not sure whether you need a permit, contact the Environment Agency or your local authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087481755&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;listed activity permits for paper and cardboard products&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you discharge cooling tower effluent or blowdown to surface waters, groundwater or land you must have an environmental permit from the Environment Agency. For discharges to the foul sewer you must have permission from your water and sewerage company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.water.org.uk/home/resources-and-links/links/water-operators/sewerage-operators"&gt;Find contact details for your water company on the Water UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087483440&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;water discharge permits&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit, licence or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prevent-legionnaires-disease"&gt;Prevent Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must keep cooling tower systems in good condition. If they are not properly maintained they can create the ideal habitat for certain bacteria, in particular Legionella which causes Legionnaires’ disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/iacl27.pdf"&gt;Download guidance on Legionnaires’ disease from the HSE website (PDF, 105K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="limit-noise-from-cooling-towers"&gt;Limit noise from cooling towers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooling tower fans may be noisy. You can fit ventilation silencers to your cooling tower fan inlet and discharge vents to reduce noise levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If noise levels cause a nuisance to your neighbours, your local authority can require you to take steps to reduce or stop the nuisance, or impose restrictions on or stop your operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency may take enforcement action if noise levels breach the conditions of any permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1086041496"&gt;noise, odour and other nuisances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-3"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspect your cooling towers regularly. Your local authority and the HSE will visit your premises to ensure you meet safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should clean cooling towers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at least twice a year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after any shutdown of more than a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after any major alterations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employ specialists to carry out cleaning. Cleaning will improve cooling tower efficiency and minimise the risk of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may store chemicals on your site, for example for maintenance. Chemicals you receive may be supplied with a safety data sheet (SDS). The SDS contains information about the chemical, including how to store, use and dispose of it safely. The SDS may also recommend the best methods and materials to use to clean up a spill. If you receive a chemical without an SDS, contact your supplier to find out whether or not they have to provide one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087469017&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;chemical and REACH responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087463934"&gt;waste and hazardous substance responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vehicle-emission-obligations-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers"&gt;Vehicle emission obligations for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your paper and cardboard business may use company vehicles to transport materials and goods, or for staff business travel. You should check and control the emissions from your vehicles to minimise their impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emissions from vehicle exhausts are a significant source of air pollution. Air pollutants in vehicle emissions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carbon dioxide (CO2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fine dust particles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nitrogen oxides&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unburnt hydrocarbons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="limit-vehicle-emissions"&gt;Limit vehicle emissions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try to limit the vehicle emissions produced by your business as they may:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lead to ill health, such as respiratory problems, in your staff and the public&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cause a nuisance to your neighbours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contribute to roadside pollution levels in urban areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contribute to climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="meet-vehicle-emission-requirements"&gt;Meet vehicle emission requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your vehicles comply with emission limits and weight regulations. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) carries out roadside checks to enforce these standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure your vehicles comply with exhaust emission standards in the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ministry of Transport (MOT) test scheme for motor vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public Service Vehicle (PSV) scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/operationalactivities/operationalactivities.htm"&gt;Find information on VOSA’s operational activities on the Department for Transport (DfT) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="check-for-local-air-quality-controls"&gt;Check for local air quality controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your local authority monitors air quality in your area. If the air quality exceeds a certain threshold, it may declare an area to be an air quality management area (AQMA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some local authorities are introducing low emission zones to reduce pollution in urban centres. These are areas where you may have to pay a daily charge if your vehicle doesn’t meet certain emission standards or qualify for an exemption. Check with your local authority to find out if there are any low emission zones or AQMAs in your area. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1074537118"&gt;Find a contact for your local authority through our Contacts Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://aqma.defra.gov.uk/"&gt;Find information on local AQMAs in the UK on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must turn off your engine if your vehicle is stationary to reduce exhaust emissions and noise. You can be prosecuted or fined by some local authorities if you leave your engine running while stationary for more than a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-4"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service all your vehicles regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor your fuel consumption to help detect problems early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-plan delivery routes to use less congested routes and maximise the efficient use of vehicles, reducing your journey time and saving you fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduce your vehicle emissions by being more fuel efficient. See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1080532425&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;using work vehicles efficiently&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1080531485"&gt;reducing your vehicle emissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buying new company vehicles, select models with low CO2 emissions and high fuel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1082646678&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=PIP"&gt;Find out fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for new and used cars with the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) Car Fuel Data service&lt;/a&gt;. For details of older vehicles, &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/members-lounge/member-services/market-intelligence/vehicle-data/co2-emissions-data/"&gt;check the CO2 emissions of vehicles on the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Ltd (SMMT) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can benefit from tax breaks by buying low emission vehicles. See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1080532548&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;tax breaks for low-emission vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1080531485"&gt;reducing your vehicle emissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reduce your vehicle emissions and possibly reduce running costs by using alternative fuels, such as gas or electrical hybrids.

&lt;p&gt;You can fit older vehicles with devices that reduce their emissions. This can be a cheaper alternative to upgrading engines. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ecotravel.org.uk/information.html?"&gt;Find information on converting your fleet to run on alternative fuels on the ECOtravel website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (HMRC) reward businesses that use cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars. Road tax and National Insurance Contributions are linked to the car’s exhaust emissions, particularly its CO2 emissions. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cars/"&gt;Read about company cars on the HMRC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vehicle-cleaning-responsibilities-for-paper-and-cardboard-producers"&gt;Vehicle cleaning responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of your business’ activities you may clean vehicles - including using wheel washes to clean the wheels and undercarriages of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are responsible for avoiding pollution from vehicle cleaning or wheel washing by anyone at your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take your vehicles to a commercial facility such as a car wash, this guidance does not apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="control-run-off-from-vehicle-cleaning"&gt;Control run-off from vehicle cleaning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface run-off from washing areas can contain high levels of pollutants such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;detergents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil and fuel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;suspended solids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grease&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;antifreeze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must not allow run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater. This will cause pollution and you could be prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should only wash vehicles in defined areas where you can contain the wash water and any rainfall run-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, direct the surface run-off from your vehicle washing area to an on-site treatment system. You could reduce your impact on the environment and save money by reusing the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to discharge surface run-off directly to a foul sewer or combined sewer. Ask your water and sewerage company if you need authorisation before you discharge run-off to a sewer. You must comply with any conditions of your authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087483440&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;water discharge permits for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, collect your run-off in a sealed unit and send it to an authorised disposal site. Check that anyone who takes your waste away from your site is a registered waste carrier. See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1097256632&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;checking your waste is dealt with correctly&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1079431917"&gt;duty of care - your waste responsibilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="use-sustainable-drainage-systems-suds"&gt;Use sustainable drainage systems (SUDS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to use SUDS to drain run-off from washing areas. SUDS slow and hold back run-off from a site, so that pollutants are broken down naturally. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1085829333"&gt;using sustainable drainage systems to prevent pollution and flooding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="be-authorised-to-use-water-from-surface-waters-or-groundwater"&gt;Be authorised to use water from surface waters or groundwater&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use (abstract) water from surface waters or groundwater for cleaning vehicles, you may need an authorisation or licence from the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087482721&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;water use licences for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-5"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use vehicle washing facilities and equipment that filter and reuse water, or set up a wash water recycling system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use trigger-operated spray guns. Make sure they have an automatic water supply cut-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use settlement lagoons or suitable absorbent material such as flocculent to remove suspended solids, eg mud and silt. Before using flocculent, contact your water and sewerage company to make sure that you can still discharge to the sewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use catchpots or silt traps on drains, and ensure that they are in place during cleaning. Empty them at regular intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove oil, grease and fuel from wash water by passing it slowly through an appropriately sized oil separator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure that any discharge containing detergent cannot run to the oil separator, as this will stop it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use detergents, use a recycling system with no discharge or ensure that run-off containing detergents is collected in a sealed unit. Contact your local water and sewerage company about disposing of these materials to the foul sewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0406BIYL-e-e.pdf?lang=_e"&gt;Download Pollution prevention guideline: Use and design of oil separators in surface water drainage systems (PPG3) from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 79K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimise the amount of cleaning chemicals you use. Choose biodegradable and phosphate-free detergents as they are less harmful to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carry out cleaning in a designated impermeable area that is isolated from the surrounding area, eg by a roll-over bund, raised kerb, ramps or stepped access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Store all cleaning chemicals safely and in an area where you can contain spills. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1086114143"&gt;chemical storage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train all staff to follow vehicle cleaning procedures. Display details of procedures in the work area so staff can check them easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pollution-incident-prevention-at-paper-and-cardboard-production-sites"&gt;Pollution incident prevention at paper and cardboard production sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollution incidents at your site can have serious environmental impacts. They may damage the water environment and biodiversity, cause air pollution and land contamination and harm human health. You can reduce the risk of pollution incidents with planning and preparation. Pollution incidents can be caused by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fuel drips, spills or overfilling during refuelling or tank filling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;plant, pipes, equipment or containers leaking oil or chemicals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pump and pipeline failures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;treatment plant failures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contaminated water entering a watercourse or drain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;natural events, such as flooding, lightning strike and temperature extremes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vandalism and theft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deliberate acts, such as illegal disposal, dumping or fly-tipping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wind blown dust and waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="produce-a-pollution-incident-response-plan"&gt;Produce a pollution incident response plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have a pollution incident response plan which outlines the actions you will take to reduce the chances that your business causes pollution from an incident or accident at your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your plan should include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your site activities and operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what you store on your site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emergency and out-of-hours contact details for key staff, regulators and emergency services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a detailed site plan showing drainage layout, areas where the chances of causing pollution are high and areas vulnerable to pollution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the actions to take in the event of an incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="prevent-and-remediate-environmental-damage"&gt;Prevent and remediate environmental damage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pollution incident may cause, or threaten to cause, environmental damage to water, land and biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must take action to prevent environmental damage and to remedy any damage you cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prevent-pollution-from-firefighting"&gt;Prevent pollution from firefighting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firewater is water that has become contaminated by being used for firefighting. It is polluting and may be classified as hazardous waste. Ensure you have a plan and equipment in place to collect or contain it in the event of an emergency. You should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;store firewater correctly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure firewater is treated and disposed of correctly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prevent firewater from running into surface drains, polluting nearby watercourses (rivers, streams and groundwater), foul drainage systems and land&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on pollution incident response plans, environmental damage and preventing pollution, see our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1086885096"&gt;pollution incidents and environmental damage - an overview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="car-park-environmental-requirements-at-paper-and-cardboard-production-sites"&gt;Car park environmental requirements at paper and cardboard production sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking areas for operational employee or customer vehicles at your paper or cardboard production business may be a source of noise or pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="reduce-noise-dust-and-nuisances-from-car-parks"&gt;Reduce noise, dust and nuisances from car parks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business causes a nuisance to your neighbours, your local authority can require you to take steps to reduce or stop the nuisance, or impose restrictions on or stop your operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuisances from parking areas could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;noise and fumes from vehicle engines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;noise from vehicle alarms, eg reversing alarms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dust from vehicle wheels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;excessive artificial lighting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;waste deposits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vermin attracted by waste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accumulated wind-blown rubbish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should control these potential sources of nuisance. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1086041496"&gt;noise, odour and other nuisances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="check-your-permit-and-exemption-conditions"&gt;Check your permit and exemption conditions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an environmental permit or registered exemption, they may contain conditions that control emissions such as noise, dust or odour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120823131012/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.s=tl&amp;amp;topicId=1087477593"&gt;environmental permits, licences and exemptions for paper and cardboard production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="control-surface-water-run-off"&gt;Control surface water run-off&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water that runs off the surface of your car parks can cause erosion, pollution and localised flooding. Run-off may contain pollutants such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oil and fuel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hydraulic fluids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;suspended solids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grease&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;antifreeze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must not allow contaminated run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater without permission. This will cause pollution and you could be prosecuted. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087482875&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;water and sewer discharge responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a car park that has an area less than 800 square metres (fewer than 50 parking spaces), and you only use it for parking cars, you can discharge surface water run-off directly as long as you are not next to sensitive environments, eg Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a larger car park, you should remove oil, grease, petrol and diesel from run-off by passing it through an oil separator before you discharge it. You should also use an oil separator for any run-off from areas used for more polluting activities, such as vehicle servicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0406BIYL-e-e.pdf?lang=_e"&gt;Download Pollution prevention guideline: Use and design of oil separators in surface water drainage systems (PPG3) from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 79K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you may be able to use sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) to drain run-off from car parks. SUDS slow and hold back run-off from a site, so that pollutants can be broken down naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1085829333"&gt;using sustainable drainage systems to prevent pollution and flooding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you clean vehicles on your car park, you must not allow run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater. If someone else cleans vehicles on your car park, it is your responsibility to ensure that they do not cause pollution. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087488896&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;vehicle cleaning responsibilities for paper and cardboard producers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-6"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use catchpots or silt traps on drains, and ensure that they are working effectively. Empty them at regular intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encourage staff and visitors to use public transport or car share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="land-contamination-responsibilities-at-paper-and-cardboard-production-sites"&gt;Land contamination responsibilities at paper and cardboard production sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you operate a paper and cardboard production business, you could be causing land contamination from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spills or leaks of fuel, oil or chemicals from your storage areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pollutants seeping from leaking pipes or poorly maintained drainage systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inappropriate handling or disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals or fuel  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper industry uses chemicals and materials that can cause contamination, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metals and metallic compounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;acids and alkalis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inorganic elements and compounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;solvents, oils and biocides  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many areas of land in the UK are contaminated by their past use. For example, land could be contaminated where chemicals have seeped into the land from previous industrial activities, or where previous owners have buried waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleaning up land affected by contamination is called remediation. Remediation ensures that the land no longer presents a risk to human health or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-land-contamination"&gt;Responsibilities for cleaning up land contamination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be responsible for cleaning up land contamination, for example, if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;develop land that is contaminated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cause environmental damage to land&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cause contamination in breach of your environmental permit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could be required to clean up land contamination before you are allowed to carry out development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cause serious land contamination that affects the water environment, protected species or habitats, or human health, this can be classed as environmental damage. You could be responsible for land contamination if it is classed as environmental damage. See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086988124&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;environmental damage caused by land contamination&lt;/a&gt; in our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1080367423"&gt;dealing with land contamination&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also be responsible for land contamination if it is caused by you breaching the terms of your environmental permit. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1087321234&amp;amp;r.l3=1087480202&amp;amp;topicId=1086287989"&gt;See our guide on environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-contaminated-land-under-part-2a"&gt;Responsibilities for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contaminated land is a legal term used to describe a specific type of land contamination that is regulated under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Part 2A deals with the UK’s legacy of contaminated land from past uses, such as former factories, mines, steelworks, refineries and landfills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your local authority is responsible for identifying contaminated land and making sure it is cleaned up. Land is classed as contaminated land under Part 2A when substances in, on or under it cause, or could cause, significant harm or pollution of surface waters and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be responsible for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cause or allow any land to be contaminated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;own or occupy the land, even if you did not cause the contamination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your local authority or the Environment Agency can serve you with a remediation notice. It will tell you what you must do to clean up the land and when you must carry out the work. A remediation notice can be served on more than one business. You can be prosecuted and may be fined if you do not comply with a remediation notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can remediate contaminated land voluntarily and agree a remediation scheme with your local authority or the Environment Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="good-practice-7"&gt;Good practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask a consultant to carry out a desktop survey and possibly some site investigations to check if land could be contaminated before you purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research the history of your site and the activities carried out on it. Investigate any land that could be contaminated and see if you can identify who may have caused any contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Store oil and chemicals safely to avoid causing pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep absorbent materials and other containment equipment close to where you might need them. Ensure that they are suitable for the type and quantity of fuel, oil and chemicals you store and use on site. Ensure that your staff know where they are and how to use them properly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Countering weapons proliferation </title>
    <category>Policy</category>
    <summary>Securing global safety by preventing countries and terrorists access to the materials needed for weapons of mass destruction.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread of weapons of mass destruction (&lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;) poses a threat to the UK and the international community. Indiscriminate trade in conventional arms and the use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (&lt;abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear"&gt;CBRN&lt;/abbr&gt;) weapons and ballistic missiles raises serious humanitarian and security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re working around the world to champion and implement UK policies as set out in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-counter-proliferation-strategy-2012-2015"&gt;National Counter-Proliferation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the spread of &lt;abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear"&gt;CBRN&lt;/abbr&gt; weapons and ballistic missiles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK works with international partners and through organisations such as the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt;, G8, NATO and the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; to reduce terrorists’ ability to create, obtain or use &lt;abbr title="chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear"&gt;CBRN&lt;/abbr&gt; materials and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="counter-proliferation-programme"&gt;Counter-Proliferation Programme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the FCO’s tools to combat these threats is our &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/countering-weapons-proliferation/supporting-pages/counter-proliferation-programme"&gt;Counter-Proliferation Programme&lt;/a&gt;. In the financial year 2012 to 13, the value of the programme is £3 million. This funding is used to support projects around the world which increase political will or technical capacity to reduce the threat of weapons proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="national-counter-proliferation-strategy"&gt;National Counter-Proliferation Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government published its &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-counter-proliferation-strategy-2012-2015"&gt;National Counter-Proliferation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; in March 2012. The strategy’s main aims are to deny terrorists the materials and expertise to make and use &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;; to stop countries such as Iran and North Korea from obtaining &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt; or advanced conventional weapons; and to build up the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.iaea.org/About/"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency (&lt;abbr title="International Atomic Energy Agency"&gt;IAEA&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; and other organisations and treaties that help us meet our goals through the international community and which help to protect global security and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="chemical-weapons"&gt;Chemical weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK supports the destruction of remaining chemical weapons stocks and works to encourage full national implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (&lt;abbr title="Chemical Weapons Convention"&gt;CWC&lt;/abbr&gt;) by all countries. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/countering-weapons-proliferation/supporting-pages/the-chemical-weapons-convention"&gt;Chemical Weapons Convention&lt;/a&gt; bans the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="biological-weapons"&gt;Biological weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has signed up to the global implementation of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/%28httpPages%29/04FBBDD6315AC720C1257180004B1B2F?OpenDocument"&gt;Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (&lt;abbr title="Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention"&gt;BTWC&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of the convention is to help prevent states acquiring or keeping biological and toxin weapons, and prevent them ever being used by states or terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention"&gt;BTWC&lt;/abbr&gt; doesn’t have a verification system like that of the &lt;abbr title="Chemical Weapons Convention"&gt;CWC&lt;/abbr&gt;. Participating countries are required to submit relevant data and declarations, or confidence-building measures, to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs. This increases openness and gives participating countries confidence that others are complying with the convention. The UK’s confidence building measures are published on the the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/%28httpPages%29/CEC2E2D361ADFEE7C12572BC0032F058?OpenDocument"&gt;Implementation Support Unit website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="nuclear-weapons"&gt;Nuclear weapons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working-towards-nuclear-disarmament"&gt;working towards nuclear disarmament&lt;/a&gt;. The UK is one of 189 states that have signed the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/countering-weapons-proliferation/supporting-pages/nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (&lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. The treaty aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and ultimately eliminate them. The &lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt; has three equally important ‘pillars’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to work towards non-proliferation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to champion nuclear disarmament &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to encourage the peaceful use of nuclear energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="nuclear-security"&gt;Nuclear security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK will continue work to strengthen international nuclear security including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;securing fissile material in Kazakhstan, in a joint project with the US &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; to build a central store for spent radioactive sources in Ukraine  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;helping to create new jobs for 3,000 former weapons scientists in Russia and other former Soviet Union countries  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assisting many other countries through our collaboration with the &lt;abbr title="International Atomic Energy Agency"&gt;IAEA&lt;/abbr&gt; on its Nuclear Security Fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue to offer funding and expertise for physical nuclear security upgrades and help support the strongest possible security.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are supporting the full implementation of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/328/43/PDF/N0432843.pdf?OpenElement"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; Security Council Resolution 1540&lt;/a&gt;, which requires all states to refrain from supporting non-government agents from developing, acquiring, manufacturing, possessing, transporting, transferring or using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and their delivery systems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="state-programmes"&gt;State programmes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the international legal framework, conventions and treaties, some countries have active programmes to develop and produce &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;. Of particular concern is Iran’s nuclear programme; the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme and willingness to provide weapons to other countries; and Syria’s possession of chemical and biological weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK works through various international organisations to seek peaceful means to reduce the threat from these programmes and the networks that support them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="arms-trade-treaty"&gt;Arms Trade Treaty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a legitimate arms trade, there is also an urgent need for more effective and coherent international regulation of that trade. The UK is working to achieve an international arms trade treaty to provide clearer and more effective control of the illegal arms trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; conference in July 2012 was unable to adopt an Arms Trade Treaty (&lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt;). However, the UK will continue to play a leading role in future negotiations to help to secure one. An &lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt; will help to reduce the flow of weapons from legitimate trade to the illicit market.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further details on the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; process towards an &lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt; and submissions from states (including the UK’s views on an &lt;abbr title="Arms Trade Treaty"&gt;ATT&lt;/abbr&gt;) are available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/ga/first/63/documentation.shtml"&gt;United Nations General Assembly website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="export-licensing"&gt;Export licensing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK has joined other governments around the world to pursue &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/3849543/eu-arms-export"&gt;collective implementation of export controls&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the proliferation of &lt;abbr title="weapons of mass destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/abbr&gt;. The 4 main export control regimes are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mtcr.info/english/index.html"&gt;Missile Technology Control Regime&lt;/a&gt;, which controls the proliferation of missile systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/Leng/default.htm"&gt;Nuclear Suppliers Group&lt;/a&gt;, which controls the supply of nuclear related technologies and materials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.australiagroup.net/en/index.html"&gt;Australia Group&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to ensure that exports do not contribute to the development of chemical or biological weapons &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.wassenaar.org/"&gt;Wassenaar Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;, which promotes greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read further details about the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-non-proliferation-and-arms-control-regimes"&gt;international non-proliferation and arms control regimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s regulatory authority responsible for assessing and issuing strategic export licences to UK exporters is the Export Control Organisation (ECO), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Read more about the UK’s policies and procedures for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/controlling-defence-security-and-dual-use-strategic-exports--2"&gt;controlling defence, security and dual-use strategic exports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (&lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt;) was borne out of fear that the Cold War era would lead to a nuclear arms race and is still the basis of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. All states are now party to it apart from India, Israel, Pakistan and South Sudan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt; provides for a Review Conference every 5 years, both to review developments over the previous 5 years and to look ahead to the future. At the last &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2010/"&gt;Review Conference in 2010&lt;/a&gt; a series of action plans were agreed to enhance implementation of the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.iaea.org/"&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; was set up as the world’s ‘Atoms for Peace’ organisation in 1957 within the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; family, and supports the &lt;abbr title="Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/abbr&gt;. The agency is at the centre of international efforts to address Iran’s nuclear dossier and to ensure the benefits of safe and secure peaceful nuclear energy are accessible to everyone, not just to the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.thenuclearsecuritysummit.org/eng_main/main.jsp"&gt;Seoul Nuclear Security Summit&lt;/a&gt; assembled 53 countries, the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt;, the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, the &lt;abbr title="International Atomic Energy Agency"&gt;IAEA&lt;/abbr&gt; and Interpol, to continue work to secure vulnerable nuclear material around the world within 4 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 December 2008 in the &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; General Assembly, 133 States voted in favour of a draft resolution ‘Towards an Arms Trade Treaty’. There was a clear majority view that, working together, the international community can shape an Arms Trade Treaty into an effective legally binding mechanism to regulate the international trade in arms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See our detailed guides on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/sanctions-embargoes-and-restrictions"&gt;Sanctions, embargoes and restrictions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions"&gt;Current arms embargoes and other restrictions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (&lt;abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy"&gt;CFSP&lt;/abbr&gt;), the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; applies restrictive measures in pursuit of the specific &lt;abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy"&gt;CFSP&lt;/abbr&gt; objectives set out in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/index.htm"&gt;Treaty on European Union&lt;/a&gt; (see particularly Article 11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/sanctions/index_en.htm"&gt;&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; External Action website&lt;/a&gt; provides an overview of restrictive measures adopted in the framework of the &lt;abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy"&gt;CFSP&lt;/abbr&gt; that are currently in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/list_compend.shtml"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; Security Council Sanctions Committees website&lt;/a&gt; contains links to the latest versions of all &lt;abbr title="United Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/abbr&gt; Security Council targeted sanctions lists.

    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>The Office for Life Sciences is part of BIS - it ensures a competitive UK life sciences industry and secures investment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="strategy-for-uk-life-sciences---one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has launched &lt;a href="/government/publications/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for life sciences - One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, a report which summarises progress made in the first 12 months since last year’s launch of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-1429-strategy-for-uk-life-sciences.pdf"&gt;‘Strategy for UK life sciences’&lt;/a&gt;. Health Life Sciences is one of the 11 sectors that have been prioritised as part of the government’s industrial strategy. &lt;a href="/government/speeches/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;See David Willetts’ speech relating to the report.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategy for UK life sciences is based on three pillars: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a UK life sciences ecosystem: the government is making it easier for researchers to commercialise academic research, placing clinical research at the heart of the NHS, and empowering patients to participate in research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attracting, developing and rewarding talent: the government is introducing measures to attract and nurture world-leading talent and develop scientific excellence (these measures are ensuring that the UK offers exciting and rewarding careers for clinicians, scientists and technicians from all around the world)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcoming barriers and creating incentives for the promotion of healthcare innovation: the government is introducing measures to incentivise early-stage investment and nurture the best innovations through the translational funding gap to a point at which they can secure follow-on investment - we’ll continue to reduce the bureaucracy of setting up clinical trials to ensure that patients have access to promising, cost-effective, new treatments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Year On reports the substantial progress made this year in implementing these measures. In order to strengthen networks between academia, industry and the NHS, the government is investing £1 billion a year through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS. The £180 million Biomedical Catalyst was introduced to bridge the ‘valley of death’ between the bench and the clinic, and the early response from industry is that this funding is already having the intended impact of stimulating innovative research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the progress made to date, One Year On announces the government’s commitment to the sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients over the next three to five years. This work will initially focus on cancer patients, patients with rare diseases and infectious disease. We are working across government to ensure that research, academia and industry are key players in promoting the adoption of genomic technology to provide better healthcare and help the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy for UK life sciences was launched alongside, and is being implemented in collaboration with, the NHS chief executive’s review: [Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating adoption and diffusion in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;. The update to this report, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/12/ihw-creating-change/"&gt;Creating Change: Innovation, Health and Wealth One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, was published on 10 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also published on 10 December 2012 was the latest report on the bioscience and health technology database, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/12-p90-strength-and-opportunity-2012-medical-technology-sectors.pdf"&gt;Strength and opportunity 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/sectoropportunities/lifesciences.html"&gt;The New UK Life Science Prospectus Life sciences in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="life-sciences-in-the-uk"&gt;Life Sciences in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has one of the strongest and most productive life sciences industries in the world, contributing to patient well-being as well as supporting growth. UK life science industries generate turnover of over £50bn and employ 167,500 people in over 4,500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry is high-tech, innovative and highly diverse, spanning pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, and industrial biotechnology and has applications across many other sectors. Through the development of innovative medicines, medical technologies and services, its businesses contribute to a stronger and fairer society, helping people enjoy better health, well-being and quality of life. They are also helping the UK improve its sustainability and increase rates of decarbonisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is building on and fostering these strengths and responding to the changing global commercial environment. We want to make the UK the location of choice for pioneering life sciences research and development (&lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt;) and manufacturing investment, so that life sciences will continue to be vibrant in the UK and a key contributor to sustained economic growth and health improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office for Life Sciences (&lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;) works closely with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, championing biotechnology and the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. We also work with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk"&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk"&gt;Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)&lt;/a&gt; and other departments, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (&lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; and the life sciences industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="views-on-the-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research"&gt;Views on the use of animals in scientific research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ipsos MORI report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/ipsos-mori-views-on-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research-september-2012.pdf"&gt;‘Views on the use of animals in scientific research’&lt;/a&gt; presents the findings of a 2012 survey on awareness of, and public attitudes towards, the use of animals in scientific research. This survey has been carried out since 1999 on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that 85% of the representative sample conditionally accept the use of animals in scientific research. While this year’s findings show a decline in overall public acceptance, it also identifies that a significant proportion of the representative sample (40%) would like to know more information about the use of animals in scientific research before forming a firm opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has challenged the scientific community to respond to these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="areas-of-work-for-the-ols"&gt;Areas of work for the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt; is focused on 2 areas: healthcare and the bio-economy. The healthcare team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical technology – devices and diagnostics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bio-economy team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agricultural biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These teams work across a range of policy areas supporting business growth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHS market access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finance and tax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bio-economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="nhs-market-access"&gt;NHS market access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Te market access team works closely with the other &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; teams, the Department of Health, and other departments and agencies. The NHS is a major contributor to economic growth, and we work together to maximise this contribution and to address any barriers to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main areas of interest for the market access team are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reforms to the NHS, including the introduction of value-based pricing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the NHS procurement strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engaging with &lt;abbr title="Department of Health"&gt;DH&lt;/abbr&gt;’s delivery of [‘Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating uptake and diffusion of innovation in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299"&gt;NHS’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we are considering how these will create opportunities for the business environment and support the growth agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="innovation"&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our focus is to ensure that industry has the right environment to innovate and in particular to remove barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently focusing on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="regenerative-medicine"&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the impact of the £25 million &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukrmp.org.uk/"&gt;UK Regenerative Medicine Platform&lt;/a&gt; which addresses the technical and scientific challenges associated with translating promising scientific discoveries in this area towards clinical impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contributing to the House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into Regenerative Medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="medicines-licensing"&gt;Medicines licensing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the government’s commitment to consult on an Early Access Scheme for Medicines &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exploring more progressive approaches to medicines regulations, including adaptive licensing, through the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; Expert Group on Healthcare Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="clinical-trials-environment"&gt;Clinical trials environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the European Commission’s plans to replace the European Clinical Trials Directive with a Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="open-innovation"&gt;Open innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the changing &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; landscape and a growing interest in new ways of partnership working, we organised a seminar on Open Innovation in May 2012. Relevant public sector organisations including the Intellectual Property Office, Technology Strategy Board, Clinical Practice Research Datalink as well as private sector interest (AstraZeneca (PPT, 2.6 Mb), Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson discussed the opportunities of the approach to the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-projects"&gt;Infrastructure projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is co-funding 2 key investment projects to stimulate further growth and address market failures by providing incubation facilities for new companies. These bioincubators are based in Stevenage in Hertfordshire, alongside the GlaxoSmithKline &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; headquarters, and on the Edinburgh BioQuarter site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has also co-funded the Industrial Biotechnology 10,000 litre Demonstrator in Wilton, an open access facility to enable companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, to trial different biomass feedstock and processes to manufacture biobased products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stevenage-bioscience-catalyst"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.stevenagecatalyst.com/"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; will be the first purpose-built, open innovation campus for drug discovery and development. It will maximise the economic impact of academic and science expertise and foster a successful open innovation model between big pharmaceutical and small bioscience companies. It will act as a catalyst to position the UK at the forefront of scientific innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst will be located alongside the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; Headquarters in Stevenage and is being developed in stages. Phase 1 comprises the construction of BioIncubator and Accelerator buildings for early-stage bioscience companies. Phase 1 is being funded by &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;, the East of England Development Agency (EEDA), the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), GSK and the Wellcome Trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future phases will bring the catalyst up to 45,000 square metres by 2016, assuming that the market demand is as expected. This is forecast to create 1500 new jobs and stimulate the creation of up to 5 new businesses. All future phases will be commercially funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="edinburgh-bioquarter---bioincubator"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter - BioIncubator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.edinburghbioquarter.com/"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter&lt;/a&gt; is a landmark life sciences hub that is establishing Edinburgh and Scotland as one of the world’s top 10 centres for biomedical research and commercialisation. The project is a long-term life science property and commercialisation partnership between Scottish Enterprise, the University of Edinburgh, the NHS and US-based private sector partner, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. The 100-acre site already houses the University of Edinburgh Queen’s Medical Research Institute and the 870-bed Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh teaching hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and Scottish Enterprise are co-funding the creation of the BioIncubator. This investment is expected to leverage almost £210m of additional investment and create or retain over 700 high-value jobs. This will enhance the global reputation of the UK as a place for leading life science innovation, by creating an infrastructure for supporting industry to collaborate with academic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Edinburgh is aiming to produce 18 new life sciences companies over the next 5 years which will add a considerable pipeline of demand for the BioIncubator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="industrial-biotechnology-demonstrator"&gt;Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in Wilton in the Tees Valley, the new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk-cpi.com/industrial-biotechnology/demonstrator"&gt;National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/a&gt; is an open access facility of a unique scale of 10,000-litre working volume capacity. The demonstrator has 2 main applications: it can be used as a proof of concept facility to scale-up the production of materials to near commercial levels; and as a product manufacturing facility for clients experiencing temporary capacity restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator"&gt;NIBF&lt;/abbr&gt; will allow biotechnology companies to de-risk product and process development. By exploring and then optimising processes, companies will be are able to calculate the most cost-effective combination of materials; process steps and sequences; and the equipment needed to manufacture profitably. Consequently, they will minimise the risk of investing in the wrong capital equipment, using inefficient processes or facing unexpected costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Innovation standardisation</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>Effective standardisation encourages innovation and forceful competition and improves profitability.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="standardisation"&gt;Standardisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation helps innovation to be applied to the whole economy and makes sure that most companies are not too far behind the early adopters of new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation can help business by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing better access to markets &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering measurable benefits when used within the infrastructure of a company itself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minimising business costs and risks &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;streamlining internal processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improving communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By promoting interoperability, standardisation provides a competitive edge in the market place; necessary for worldwide trading of products and services. In particular for SMEs, demonstrable compliance with an accepted standard can replace the power of a big brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-standardisation"&gt;What is standardisation?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation includes the development of the standard as well as how it is used. End-users should have confidence in their purchase because the supplier has used an appropriate standard and has gone through independent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="biss-role-in-standardisation"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;’s role in standardisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is responsible for UK government policy on everything to do with standards-making, accreditation and conformity assessment. We will strengthen the standards, accreditation and conformity assessment infrastructure so that it meets the needs of UK industry and to make the processes more relevant and business friendly. We sponsor, and work closely with, the British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the UK National Standards Body (&lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the National Accreditation Body (&lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the European Commission (EC) we help develop European standardisation policy, which can remove barriers to trade. This includes the recent EC regulation on accreditation and market surveillance, and the EC decision on a common framework for marketing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also the central contact point for Directive 98/34/EC that requires member states to notify the EC of proposed national technical regulations; and Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment; and Refusals of Mutual Recognition Decision 3052/95/EC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work closely with technical regulations colleagues and also a number of other government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD’s &lt;abbr title="(UK Defence Standardization"&gt;DStan&lt;/abbr&gt; (UK Defence Standardization) works to develop, facilitate and communicate UK MOD standardisation policies, standards, procedures and guidance on standardisation both nationally and internationally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="standardisation-infrastructure"&gt;Standardisation infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conformity assessment helps companies demonstrate that they have met customers’ needs and includes activities like testing, inspection and certification. The organisations that test, inspect, etc, are known as Conformity Assessment Bodies (&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt;). &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; works to make sure conformity assessment in the UK is well managed, competent and market driven, and so contributes to the productivity and competitiveness of UK businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; notified to the Commission under the European New Approach legislation are known as Notified Bodies (&lt;abbr title="Notified bodies"&gt;NBs&lt;/abbr&gt;). Where there is European Community legislation, the requirements for &lt;abbr title="Notified bodies"&gt;NBs&lt;/abbr&gt; makes sure that products and services assessed in one member state can be accepted in another. However, where there are national regulatory requirements, conformity assessment requirements can differ from country to country and can create barriers to trade. Our work on the quality and conformity assessment infrastructure helps to reduce these barriers by providing ways that allow recognition of conformity assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has produced a guidance document for regulators, on the conformity assessment aspects of European Decision 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products. It deals with the requirements for notification of &lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; and conformity assessment procedures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="accreditation"&gt;Accreditation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accreditation is given when a conformity assessment body is recognised as competent to carry out specific tasks. It is generally accepted that for an accreditation body to be authoritative it must have the support of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A statement of the main principles relating to conformity assessment policy in the UK, including accreditation, has been developed and was first published in May 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="standards"&gt;Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards are the the most important point of the infrastructure, providing the matrix in which the other elements operate with &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;, playing an important role in developing standards domestically and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a toy maker the chances are you will wish to manufacture your toy so that it meets the relevant international and national standards - this will help you sell your product in the UK as well as overseas. To demonstrate to buyers that your product really does meet the standard you will need to employ an independent and impartial third party to assess your product against the standard. These third parties are known as conformity assessment bodies (&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t want to use any old organisation, but a CAB who you know to be competent and whose assessment will be universally accepted. National Accreditation Bodies (NABS) - &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is the UK’s &lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt; - assess the &lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; against international standards to make sure that they are competent to assess against specific standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NABs are reviewed to make sure that they are competent by taking evaluations by their peers and by being subject to government audit and appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This infrastructure provides confidence, trust and assurance to consumers and purchasers that the toy meets the standard that the manufacturer claims it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="non-accredited-certification"&gt;Non-accredited certification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is aware that some certification bodies and certification body representative associations are concerned at the increase in the number of UK organisations offering non-accredited certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, have a look at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/c/12-759-conformity-assessment-and-accreditation-policy.pdf"&gt;Conformity Assessment Accreditation Policy&lt;/a&gt;  on Accreditation and Conformity Assessment, and specifically to section 3.4 on the application of the accreditation principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In applying these principles, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommends Conformity Assessment Bodies to be accredited by the National Accreditation Body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recommends UK businesses, government and local authorities requiring third party conformity assessment services to source such services, where they exist, from conformity assessment bodies accredited by a National Accreditation Body.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has further advised certification representative organisations in the UK that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only get ‘accreditation’ (in the UK) from United Kingdom Accreditation Service through the regulation. Any organisation that is suggesting it is accredited in the sense of the regulation when they are not, is likely to be guilty of an offence under the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008 (Statutory Instrument 2008/1276).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certification bodies or representative organisations should refer these cases to trading standards or the Office of Fair Trading in the first instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance"&gt;EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and market surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation will, for the first time, establish a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 4(1) of Regulation 765/08 required that &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; appoint a single National Accreditation Body (&lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;) for the United Kingdom. The Accreditation Regulations 2009 (Statutory Instrument 2009 No. 3155), laid in Parliament on 3 December 2009, appointed the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the UK’s &lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/contents/made"&gt;statutory instrument&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/memorandum/contents"&gt;explanatory memorandum&lt;/a&gt; are available from the legislation.gov.uk website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In support of this statutory instrument, &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; signed, on 8 December 2009, a revised memorandum of understanding with &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementation-of-eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance-in-the-united-kingdom"&gt;Implementation of EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and Market Surveillance in the United Kingdom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation established a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drafts of both the statutory instrument and &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt; were tabled at the &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; Policy Advisory Committee on 1 October 2009 as well as being circulated to the &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; conformity assessment consultation group (ConCAss). While the main interest in these documents is contained within these 2 groups, they were open for comment to the public in general, and a copy is available below. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;’s response to the comments received was made on 25 November 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="british-standards-institution-bsi"&gt;British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work in this area covers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the government’s general policy on matters relating to standards-making (but not on the individual standards)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the government’s relations with the British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) and its funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s standards development work, including support for delegations representing the UK at overseas standards meetings and for consumer representation in standards-making activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer representation is vital in influencing the standards to reflect the needs and expectations of the general public for things like safety and security, labelling, accessibility, fairness and redress.  More can be found about consumer representation and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services"&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Consumer and Public Interest Network on the &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; itself is an independent body, established by Royal Charter in the 1920s, although its origins go back to 1901. Its HQ is at Chiswick. More information can be found on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s own website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills recognise that, whilst the process of developing standards facilitated by &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; in the UK is a voluntary activity, there is a public interest in standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A revised memorandum of understanding (&lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;) between &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the department was signed on 20 June 2002. The main changes from the previous &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt; included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incorporation of main points from the joint statement of the public interest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recognition that &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; has significant commercial businesses outside its &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; functions, and focuses on the relationship between the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; and non-&lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; sides - this has meant defining a ‘ring-fence’ both in terms of the use of public funds and in the precedence of the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; as a whole&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an indication of a willingness in principle to provide government support if the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; runs into major difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening of the international and European context, including a specific reference to standardisation policy developed by the Council of the EU&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear encouragement to &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; to develop their standardisation business beyond traditional ‘full’ standards in response to new technology, globalisation, etc, coupling this with a specific obligation to avoid ‘new products’ spreading at the expense of full standards in circumstances where the new features of full standards are still required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Memorandum of Understanding (&lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;), provides a framework for &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the government to meet the challenges to the UK’s standards-making infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h3 id="funding"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; standards work is provided in 2 main ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as direct financial support to &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; (which is linked to specific deliverables)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as help to those involved in the standards preparation work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="schemes"&gt;Schemes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Assisted International Travel Scheme provides a contribution towards the travel costs of the leaders of committee delegations to overseas standards meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Consultancy Drafting Scheme allows the &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; technical committees to use an outside expert to help prepare the first draft of a standard that is needed quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the consumer travel expenses fund contributes to the travel costs of consumer representatives in national and overseas committees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a condition on approval of funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and standards-making activities in 2000-2001, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry requested that a study be carried out of the economic benefits of standardisation, in particular of the government’s financial support for standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Swann of Manchester Business School, conducted this study, beginning with a review of the literature in this particular field. The report of his study is available below in English, French and German, along with an update from May 2010 exploring developments and progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="united-kingdom-accreditation-service-ukas"&gt;United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is recognised as the sole UK organisation for the accreditation of certification, testing and inspection bodies to the EN 45000 and ISO 17000 series of standards. These bodies - the Conformity Assessment Bodies - in turn certify, test and inspect companies’ systems and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is licensed by &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; to use and confer the national accreditation symbols (formerly national accreditation marks) which symbolise government recognition of the accreditation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; and accredited organisations is available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification bodies and companies registered by &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification bodies are listed in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tso-quality.co.uk/qaregister/subscriber/about.htm"&gt;United Kingdom Register of Quality Assessed Companies published by the Stationery Office.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of conformity assessment bodies. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification, testing and calibration and inspection reduces the need for suppliers to be assessed by each of their customers. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;’ involvement in international groups provides mutual recognition that reduces the need for multiple assessments of suppliers and as a helps to reduce barriers to trade. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; therefore recommends the use of &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; accredited conformity assessment services whenever this is an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; also assesses potential Notified Bodies on behalf of &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and other government departments according to the principles established by &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="recent-ec-legislation"&gt;Recent EC legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance [EC 765 of 2008]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EC Decision on a common framework for the marketing of products [EC 768 of 2008]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;have received approval, following a review of the new approach. These are complementary and both aim to improve the free movement of goods within the internal market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulation puts accreditation into a legal framework in the EEA, enhancing confidence in conformity assessment by strengthening the role of accreditation. It will also reinforce market surveillance structures to protect citizens from unsafe products (including those from outside the EU) and helps compliant businesses by removing those products from the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision, which will not have direct effect in member states, will set a formal framework for future European legislative proposals that fall within its scope. The scope is very broad for both proposals and includes all products subject to community harmonisation legislation (with notable exceptions such as food and medicines). The decision contains additional measures that will be integrated into the legal framework as specific legislative proposals are brought forward. This will clarify commonly used procedures and terms (which are often used differently) so that all stakeholders can be clear on relative responsibilities. In addition there are new rules to enhance confidence in CE marking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="eu-notification-requirements-goods-and-electronic-services"&gt;EU notification requirements: goods and electronic services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="directive-9834ec"&gt;Directive 98/34/EC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Notification requirements for goods and electronic services is known as the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 98/34/EC (as amended by Directive 98/48/EC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive applies to ‘information society services’ (ie services supplied at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services), and to all industrially manufactured products and agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive aims to prevent new technical barriers to trade being created and has a procedure for providing information on technical standards and regulation. It applies to all member states, the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), EFTA (Switzerland) and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="technical-regulations"&gt;Technical regulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulations that need notification have to be notified to the commission in draft, and generally observe a 3-month ‘standstill’ period before the regulation is made or brought into force. This is so that the  commission and member states can raise concerns about potential barriers to trade. If a notified regulation is considered as a barrier to trade, a detailed opinion may be submitted and this will extend the standstill period for a another 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; acts as the central unit for the UK, administering the notification procedure on behalf of government departments and receiving other member states’ notifications for onward transmission to the relevant department. Government departments involve industry as appropriate in their comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="directive-9834---a-guide"&gt;Directive 98/34 - a guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directive 98/34 sets up a legal mechanism, which requests member states to notify the commission and the other members of their technical regulations, at a draft stage, where amendments can still be introduced and a standstill period of 3 months observed before the draft technical regulation (except for urgencies, fiscal and financial measures) is adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="case-study-non-notification-of-technical-regulations-under-directive-9834ec--video-recordings-act-1984"&gt;Case study: non-notification of technical regulations under directive 98/34/ec – video recordings act 1984&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2009 there was a great deal of negative press coverage when it was discovered that the provisions of the Video Recordings Act 1984 were unenforceable as a result of the UK’s failure to notify the measure under Directive 98/34/EC. It was made clear that, because of the unenforceability of the regulations, legislation that would protect under 18s from unsuitable videos - potentially containing violent or sexually-explicit material - was never enacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although non-notification of technical regulations falling within the scope of Directive 98/34/EC is not a major issue in the UK, the consequences of any failure to notify can be serious and steps have been taken to make sure that this situation does not arise again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the non-enforceability of the Video Recordings Act was discovered, the relevant legislation was notified to the European Commission in September 2009 (notification 2009/0495/UK - The Video Recordings Act 1984 (as adopted by the Video Recordings Bill) and The Video Recordings (Labelling) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;amp;iNumber=0495&amp;amp;"&gt;Regulations to be made under section 8 of the adopted 1984 Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed in December 2009 by the related notification 2009/0664/UK - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;amp;iNumber=0664&amp;amp;"&gt;The Digital Economy Bill (extract of five clauses and a Schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2009 a joint Cabinet Office/&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; letter was sent to Permanent Secretaries reminding government departments of the need to comply with the provisions of Directive 98/34/EC. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; followed this up in early 2010 with a letter to Directive 98/34/EC policy leads, drawing attention to a request in the Cabinet Office/&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; communication of October 2009 for all government departments to carry out an assessment of all technical regulations they had made since 1983 for compatibility with the directive, in order to ensure that all relevant legislation had been correctly notified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Cabinet Office and &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; letters of late 2009 and early 2010, government departments carried out their assessments as requested. Although we received confirmations that regulations compatible with Directive 98/34/EC had been notified, further instances of non-notification came to light. The following are examples of notifications submitted as a result of assessments revealing failure to comply with the directive as required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;amp;iNumber=0318&amp;amp;sCountry=UK&amp;amp;"&gt;2010/0318/UK - PAS66:2009 Official identification eartags for sheep and goats – Specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;amp;iNumber=0319&amp;amp;sCountry=UK&amp;amp;"&gt;2010/0319/UK - 2010/0319/UK - PAS44:2009 Official identification for cattle – Specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson learned from the above is that it is very important for all government departments to constantly check any proposed new legislation for notifiability under Directive 98/34/EC, and notify any compatible regulations in draft before making them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notifications-and-comments"&gt;Notifications and comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-the-notification-system-works"&gt;How the notification system works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is based on member states consulting each other and the commission before they adopt technical regulations and to modify their drafts if necessary. The directive requires member states to communicate to the commission any draft technical regulation which they plan to adopt using the notification form available on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each member state has a central contact point for the directive which coordinates notifications of new national technical regulations as well as those received from other member states, as well as responses to the notifications. The UK contact point is in the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and can be contacted by email: 9834@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new technical regulation is notified, the notification form (in pdf) is completed by the department proposing the measure, specifying the content and reasons for its enactment. The completed form is then sent to the central contact point for processing and forwarding to the commission, together with the draft text of the regulation to be notified, impact assessment if one is available and other relevant documentation that would help the commission and other member states in assessing the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission then sends all the information communicated by the notifying member state to all the other member states and allocates a 3-month standstill period. The date of receipt by the commission of the draft national technical regulation communicated by a member state and of all the requested documents is the beginning of the 3-month standstill period during which the member state concerned is strictly obliged not to adopt the draft notified regulation. During this standstill period, the commission or member states can respond with comments or a detailed opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When notifications from other member states are received, the central contact point forwards them to the lead department and other departments with an interest, providing an opportunity to submit comments or detailed opinions if they feel this is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="when-to-send-comments"&gt;When to send comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are sent when the notified text, although in accordance with community law, raises issues of interpretation or calls for details of the arrangements for its implementation. They can also give an overall assessment of the measure, having regard to the general principles of community law and policies implemented in this context, or inform the member state of its future obligations with regard to acts to be adopted on a community level. Comments do not extend the initial 3-month standstill period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responding-to-comments"&gt;Responding to comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the directive, the notifying member state has no formal obligation to reply to the comments received. In practice, however, member states frequently do so on a voluntary basis and generally take account of comments they receive. All responses to comments should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="detailed-opinions"&gt;“Detailed opinions”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed opinions are sent by the commission or the member states when they consider that the draft measure envisaged would, if adopted, create obstacles to the free movement of goods, the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment of service operators within the internal market. These detailed opinions seek to obtain an amendment to the proposed measure, in order to remove at source any resulting barriers to such freedoms. A detailed opinion received on a notification extends the initial 3-month standstill period by another 3 months, ie to a total of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responding-to-a-detailed-opinion"&gt;Responding to a detailed opinion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Member states must reply to a detailed opinion addressed to them by the commission or another member state. Although the directive does not specify the time allowed for reply, it is nevertheless desirable that a response be made as soon as possible in the interests of efficiency, preferably during the standstill periods of 6 or 4 months, respectively for goods and information society services. All responses to detailed opinions should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="confirmation-that-a-member-state-is-free-to-make-a-regulation-once-the-standstill-period-has-ended"&gt;Confirmation that a member state is free to make a regulation once the standstill period has ended&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation is received from the commission. Once a standstill period for any particular notification has ended, the originator is free to make the regulation provided that no comments or opinions have been received and/or there are no issues still outstanding as result of a detailed opinion. It is a good idea to check with the central point just after the standstill period has ended, in case any last minute comments or opinions have been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="national-regulations-and-notification"&gt;National regulations and notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only those technical regulations that come within the scope of the directive require notification and there are certain exceptions allowed in the directive. The directive defines what is a ‘technical regulation’ and it is very wide in scope, for example it includes codes of practice and voluntary agreements so government departments have to check whether the regulations they wish to enact come within the scope of notification. If they do, the department should notify the regulations at a draft stage and observe the standstill period before adopting the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-if-a-regulation-is-not-notified"&gt;What if a regulation is not notified?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission can initiate infraction proceedings for failure to notify a national regulation that comes within the scope of the directive. If in doubt measures should be notified in draft since a non-notified measure which should have been notified will be unenforceable. It is not possible to make a notification if a regulation is already in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central contact point in &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; will be happy to give you further information or answer your queries. In addition to the information that is already available on our website, you may also find the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/index_en.htm"&gt;Commission’s website on Directive 98/34/EC&lt;/a&gt; helpful from where you can download reference documents for example, the text of the Directive, Commission’s guidance document, their reports on the functioning of the Directive and case law as well as the ability to search their database of notifications already made by member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="submitting-a-notification"&gt;Submitting a notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For government departments or agencies wishing to know more about the directive and the notification system, guidance for officials is also available. Government departments or agencies should use Form A (below) with the associated guidance document for notifying proposed technical regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="aerospace"&gt;Aerospace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roger Bourne (email: &lt;a href="mailto:roger.bourne@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;roger.bourne@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;, telephone: 020 7215 1128) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aviation-technology"&gt;Aviation technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS supports the aerospace and defence sector on a wide range of technology activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS ensures the international regulations and standards that are developed to minimise the impact of civil aviation are adequate, fair, contribute to the aviation industry’s sustainability and are not in conflict with the legitimate interests of UK aerospace industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires policy development, co-ordination of research activities, environmental model development, project environmental assessment and environmental forecasts and scenarios. Close co-operation takes place with the Department for Transport, which takes technical advice from us. We co-operate with the International Civil Aviation Organization, European Civil Aviation Conference expert panel on the Abatement of Nuisances Caused by Air Transport (ECAC/ANCAT), United Nations Economic Commission For Europe (UNECE), and the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aerospace-msc-bursary-scheme"&gt;Aerospace MSc Bursary Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2012 at the Farnborough Airshow, the Prime Minister announced funding for 500 Masters-level degree places in aerospace engineering over the next three years – from 2013 to 2014 onwards. The places will be jointly funded with industry, with government committing £3 million, and will help provide industry with the next generation of skilled engineers they need. The programme will be overseen by the Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Aeronautical Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information on the bursary scheme will be available soon on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raeng.org.uk"&gt;Royal Academy of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://aerosociety.com"&gt;Royal Aeronautical Society&lt;/a&gt; websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aerospace-business-leaders-and-aerospace-growth-partnership-groups"&gt;Aerospace Business Leaders and Aerospace Growth Partnership Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aerospace Business Leaders Group is the senior engagement forum to discuss issues of strategic importance affecting the sector. The Group is chaired by the Secretary of State for BIS and also attended by the Minister for Business and Enterprise and senior BIS officials. Industry is represented by a small group of the UK’s top aerospace business leaders. Having identified key strategic issues, such as barriers to growth and key competitiveness drivers, action will be taken forward through an Aerospace Growth Partnership group, chaired by the Minister for Business and Enterprise, with wider business representation across the supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/r/12-954-reach-skies-strategic-vision-uk-aerospace.pdf"&gt;Reach for the skies: a strategic vision of aerospace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="repayable-launch-investment"&gt;Repayable launch investment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repayable launch investment is a risk-sharing government investment in the design and development of civil aerospace projects in the UK. The investment is repayable at a real rate of return, usually via levies on sales of the product. Repayable launch investment is permitted for the civil aerospace under the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which charges the Secretary of State with ‘organising, carrying out and encouraging measures for the designing, development and production of civil aircraft.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 25 years the Government has invested £1.7 billion in repayable launch investment projects and during that period £2.7 billion has been received in income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="automotive"&gt;Automotive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="contacts"&gt;Contacts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific job of BIS Automotive Unit is to help the UK Automotive Industry succeed. It does this by encouraging the spread of best practice in design and manufacture, supporting inward investment and influencing the design of regulations and tax policy so that they reflect the best interests of the sector. &lt;/p&gt;

The team is responsible for BIS’s relationship with the two main automotive trade associations, the &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; and the RMI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="innovation-and-skills-team"&gt;Innovation and Skills Team&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team leads on strategic issues where innovation, technology and skills are central to the sustainable development of the automotive sector as a critical part of an integrated transport system. It is responsible for taking forward BIS’s objectives under the Powering Future Vehicles strategy and manages BIS’s relationship with &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; Foresight Vehicle , the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership and the &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; Industry Forum. The I&amp;amp;S Team plays a leading role in the Technology Strategy Board’s Innovation Platforms and Knowledge Transfer Networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id="analysis-team"&gt;Analysis Team&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owned by BIS, Constructionline is a contributor to the Rethinking Construction initiative. It is the UK’s register of pre-qualified construction contractors and consultants. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.constructionline.co.uk/static/"&gt;Constructionline&lt;/a&gt; is designed to streamline pre-qualification procedures, to save valuable resources in the construction industry, rendering it more efficient and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="green-construction-board"&gt;Green Construction Board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grasping the opportunities for growth presented by a sustainable construction, infrastructure and property sector is the main priority for the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.greenconstructionboard.org"&gt;Green Construction Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board, co-chaired by Minister of State for Business, Rt Hon Michael Fallon MP and President and CEO of Skanska UK, Mike Putnam, is focused on taking a unified approach to the problems facing the industry, providing strategic leadership on key issues and identifying steps to promote the UK’s excellence in green construction. The Board will also work to promote the message that a ‘green’ construction sector can lead to business opportunities and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="purpose"&gt;Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as monitoring the delivery of this Action Plan, the Board is also updating and refreshing actions going forward and takes collective responsibility for leading the change to a low carbon economy. The Green Construction Board will look more widely at green property and construction issues, encompassing priority activities of the Strategy for Sustainable Construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="low-carbon-construction"&gt;Low carbon construction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innovation and growth team was establised in 2009 to review the construction industry to ensure it was ‘fit for purpose’ for delivering a low carbon future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review looked at the strengths of and opportunities for the UK construction industry in a low carbon economy and considered how the UK can be a world leader in this sector. This review was led by Paul Morrell, the Chief Construction Adviser, and was undertaken by a mix of industry experts and those with wider business experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="construction-statistics"&gt;Construction statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS Construction Market Intelligence (CMI) has responsibility for the collection, analysis and publication of statistics on the construction sector. We provide regular statistical analyses of building materials and overseas trade, price and cost indices and key performance indicators for the construction industry. As well as statistical advice, we work closely with economists in BIS to assist in the assessment of the construction market and in the formulation of efficient policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2010 BIS launched its ‘Growth Review Framework for Advanced Manufacturing’. The Framework document was an invitation to provide comments and evidence to help identify the challenges and barriers to manufacturing growth, to feed into the Growth Review process. The document set out the Government’s ambitions for manufacturing, developed through consultation with industry. It was supported by in-depth economic analysis and a statistical annex in order to provide a substantial evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bis-retail-strategy"&gt;BIS Retail Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS has developed a range of sector specific objectives which will be taken forward over the course of 2012 to 2013. These objectives have been developed to facilitate growth of the sector at a local, national, European and international level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/b/12-1197-bis-retail-strategy.pdf"&gt;BIS Retail Strategy&lt;/a&gt;  was developed with input from the British Retail Consortium, the Association of Convenience Stores and Gloucestershire First (the first Local Enterprise Partnership Retail Pathfinder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="retail-policy-forum"&gt;Retail Policy Forum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Retail Policy Forum (RPF - chaired by BIS’s Retail Unit) enables a representative cross-section of retailers, and their representative bodies, to talk to Government Departments and EU officials about regulations and other key policies affecting the sector at an early stage in the process. It aims to help both retailers and policy makers by minimising the burdens on retail, looking for alternatives to regulations (where appropriate) and making any regulations and enforcement as practical and sensible as possible. The RPF meets three times a year. When necessary, additional meetings are held to take an in-depth look at particular subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Retail Unit also manages a Virtual RPF of UK retailers, trade associations and others with a professional interest in retailing. Communications are mainly by email and members can join the RPF’s working groups. To apply for membership of the Virtual RPF please email the Retail Unit explaining your interest in the sector and supplying contact details, including job title, telephone number and postal address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="healthy-high-street"&gt;Healthy High Street?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/h/10-1224-healthy-high-street.pdf"&gt;Healthy High Street? A healthcheck for high streets and town centres&lt;/a&gt;  was published in November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide is a simple to use health check to alert retailers and others to early signs of potential decline in their High Street – and to do so in good time for them to take preventative action. It then offers some useful first steps, including advice on working together with others to rejuvenate the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-portas-review"&gt;The Portas review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2011 the Prime Minister announced that he had asked Mary Portas, leading retail marketing consultant, to undertake a review of the English high street. The report was published in December 2011: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/p/11-1434-portas-review-future-of-high-streets.pdf"&gt;The Portas review: an independent review into the future of our high streets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/2120019.pdf"&gt;government’s formal response to the recommendations made by Mary Portas&lt;/a&gt; in her report was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government in March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="understanding-high-street-performance"&gt;Understanding high street performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS has also published a report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-1402-understanding-high-street-performance.pdf"&gt;Understanding high street performance&lt;/a&gt;, which explores the many factors impacting on the economic and social performance of town centres and High Streets. This study is intended to help inform government and local authority decision-making regarding town centres, high streets and local economic growth. It has also provided input to the Mary Portas review.  The executive summary is available separately: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-1433-understanding-high-street-performance-summary.pdf"&gt;Understanding high street performance: executive summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Approach to Charging</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Part of the government response to the consultation on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, now known as the Public Data Group (PDG).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government launched a formal consultation on 4 August 2011 to look in detail at key questions on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, which since the Autumn Statement in November 2011 is now known as the Public Data Group (PDG). The consultation questions focused on: charging, licensing and regulatory oversight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the initial government response to the consultation, published in March 2012, the government committed that it “will continue to consider the options for charging including those set out in the consultation and will report back by the end of 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, based on information supplied by the Public Data Group Trading Funds (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) the following slides have been put together to clarify the approach to charging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides provide an overview of the regulatory and guidance framework, the differences between the trading funds which underpin their approach to charging and an overview of the current charging models including reference to some of the work being undertaken to respond to changes in the end markets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Public Data Group’s commitment to ongoing collaborations and sharing of best practice, we will continue to build on this work and focus on developing appropriate frameworks and guidelines to help deliver new charging models relevant to the Public Data Group Trading Funds and their respective markets. &lt;/p&gt;
