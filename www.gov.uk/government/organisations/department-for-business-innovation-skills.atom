    <title>Press Release: Geraint Jones appointed as reviewer for the Office For Fair Access</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, announced today that he is appointing Geraint Jones as the statutory reviewer for OFFA. Should a university or college object to a provisional decision by the Director of Fair Access, the reviewer can be asked to assess the case impartially. He may recommend that there are grounds for the Director to reconsider his decision.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geraint Jones QC was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge before going to the Bar in 1976. He took silk in 2001 and is now recognised as a leading commercial and Chancery practitioner with extensive experience of judicial review work. He has an undoubted reputation for fearless independence and impartiality in upholding the rule of law. He sits as a Recorder and as a part-time Judge of the Tax Tribunal. He is also an arbitrator at the International Court of Arbitration for Sport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted that Geraint Jones will be the reviewer for OFFA, his skills and experience, if called upon, will be of great value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The position of statutory reviewer for OFFA has been in place since OFFA was established in 2004. So far there has been no need to call upon the services of the statutory reviewer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the ‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB), published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Press Release: New proposals to stand up for British pubs and prevent unfair practices</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Plans for pub industry adjudicator to help tackle unfair practices, including rents and the prices publicans pay for beer.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling pub landlords were promised help today with Business Secretary Vince Cable announcing plans for an independent Adjudicator to address unfair practices in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the new Adjudicator Dr Cable also wants to establish a new statutory Code to look at the relationship between large pub companies and publicans, which will be enforced by the Adjudicator. This new Code will ensure fair practices for a number of issues including rents and the prices publicans pay for beer. It would also have the power to investigate and deal with disputes between pub companies (pubcos) and publicans, and in some cases have the power to fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the proposed Code would prevent abuses of the beer tie, which oblige publicans to sell particular types of beer. It would enshrine the fundamental principle that ‘a tied licensee should be no worse off than a free-of-tie-licensee’ which will ensure a level playing field is maintained in the pub sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is some real hardship in the pubs sector, with many pubs going to the wall as publicans struggling to survive on tiny margins.  Some of this is due to pubcos exploiting and squeezing their publicans by unfair practices and a focus on short-term profits. Four Select Committee reviews since 2004 have highlighted these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last year we gave the pubcos one last chance to change their behaviour but it is clear that the self-regulatory approach was not enough and in October I wrote to the industry to seek their views. A change in the law is now needed to shift behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I hope these measures mean publicans are given a fairer chance at running their pub, which in turn will help them grow their businesses instead of losing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formal consultation on these proposed measures will be launched in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed Code will be based on the existing Industry Framework Code but will be strengthened to include an overarching ‘fair dealing’ provision, and also the principle referring to the beer tie which states that ‘a tied licensee should be no worse off than a free-of-tie-licensee’. This will be particularly important for rents, as the consultation will propose that guidance issued by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors be interpreted in light of this principle. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proposed Adjudicator will be based on the model of the widely-welcomed Groceries Code Adjudicator, and will have the power and function to:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arbitrate individual disputes between large pub companies and publicans&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;carry out investigations based on complaints that have been received, during which they could require information from pub companies&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;impose sanctions where an investigation finds that a pub company has breached the Code – including, in the case of severe breaches, financial penalties&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;publish guidance on when and how investigations will proceed and how these enforcement powers will be used&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;advise pub companies and publicans on the Code&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;report annually on his or her work&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;recommend changes to the Code&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Code is expected to apply to all pub companies which own more than 500 tied leases, exempting smaller companies so that only those with the greatest market power are targeted. This is due to evidence indicating that smaller companies have been behaving responsibly, although this will be explored further during the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns about the relationship between pubcos and publicans have been raised by the pub industry for many years, with BIS Select Committee Reports highlighting the issue continuously since 2009. In 2011 the Committee recommended that the Government implement a binding industry Code and establish a Code Adjudicator. In November 2011 the Government announced a self regulatory approach, with the Code being brought into legal contracts and the industry establishing an independent arbitrator and advisory services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The independent arbitration service appears to be working well, with two of the three cases heard so far finding against the pubcos. Version 5 of the Industry Framework Code was incorporated into contracts by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following further concerns raised by the BIS Select Committee the Secretary of State wrote to the industry to ask for evidence on how well the self-regulatory approach was working. Many responses showed some improvements had been made, but that much more was needed and that the necessary culture change had not taken place. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Product safety for manufacturers</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>Technical and legal requirements for safety, design, packaging and insurance, to ensure products are safe and fit for purpose.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good design and manufacturing processes are essential to ensure you meet these technical and legal requirements. They can also give your business a competitive edge and save costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide sets out the key safety, design, packaging and insurance issues you need to consider in relation to your products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="your-legal-responsibilities"&gt;Your legal responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, all products must be ‘fit for purpose’, be of satisfactory quality and fit its description. This means that your products must fulfil the purpose the customer has been led to expect and the reasons that led them to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act also covers any purpose that a customer asks about when the product is purchased and is guaranteed by the retailer to meet that purpose when it is sold. If a product is not fit for purpose, the customer is within their rights to have the goods replaced or repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/business-advice/treating-customers-fairly/sogahome/"&gt;Sale of Goods Act guidance on the Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition, good design will lead to safe design. While meeting your legal obligations is the minimum required, it is a good idea to go further and take best practice on board throughout the design, production, supply and disposal stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manufacturer or supplier you could be held liable in any legal action for harm caused to consumers or businesses as a result of unintended side-effects or the failure of products manufactured or supplied by you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your manufacturing and processing systems must comply with environmental law. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/netregs/"&gt;read guidance to help you keep up with your environmental responsibilities on the NetRegs website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See this guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/ce-marking"&gt;&lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="products-covered-by-specific-safety-regulations"&gt;Products covered by specific safety regulations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark is a manufacturer’s claim that its product meets specified essential safety requirements set out in relevant European directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain categories of products must bear &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking if you intend to sell them in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;member states of the European Economic area (&lt;abbr title="European Economic area"&gt;EEA&lt;/abbr&gt;) - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following categories of products require &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking if you wish to sell them within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; or member states of the &lt;abbr title="European Economic area"&gt;EEA&lt;/abbr&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;toys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;electrical products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;construction products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pressure vessels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;telecommunications equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;machinery, equipment and safety components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;personal protective equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;satellite station equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gas appliances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pressure equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;appliances (other than gas)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;non-automatic weighing instruments and equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;measuring instruments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recreational craft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lift machinery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;equipment and protective systems for explosive atmospheres&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in vitro diagnostic medical devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marine equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety components and subsystems for incorporation into cableway installations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cableway equipment (ski tows etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement for &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking and the exact process you will need to go through varies from product to product. Different types of product are governed by different European directives. For example, the trade of certain machinery, equipment and safety components is governed by the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008. The regulations implement a European directive aimed at removing technical barriers to trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the regulations, products that conform to the relevant safety standards are &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marked and can be placed on the market across the &lt;abbr title="European Economic area"&gt;EEA&lt;/abbr&gt;. Responsibility for ensuring compliance with the regulations rests with the manufacturer of the machinery, equipment or components in question. Failure to do so can result in prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file52968.pdf"&gt;Download guidance on the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations (PDF, 424KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where an item of equipment is covered by more than one directive, it must be &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marked under all applicable directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you supply consumer products which aren’t covered by these specific directives, they must not be &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marked. However, you still have a general duty to ensure they are safe for normal or reasonably foreseeable use under the General Product Safety Regulations 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also see this guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/ce-marking"&gt;&lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fireworks---information-for-suppliers-retailers-and-display-event-organisers"&gt;Fireworks - information for suppliers, retailers and display event organisers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fireworks are available throughout the year from shops licensed to supply them. They become widely available at certain times of the year, mainly a few days before New Year’s Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year, and in the weeks leading up to Bonfire Night on 5 November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you supply or sell fireworks or if you organise display events you must be aware of your responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="your-responsibilities-as-a-firework-manufacturer-or-importer"&gt;Your responsibilities as a firework manufacturer or importer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manufacture category 1, 2 or 3 fireworks or import category 1, 2 or 3 fireworks which are manufactured outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, you must ensure they conform to European safety standards before supplying them for sale to the public. To do this, you need to ensure that the fireworks have been tested by a notified body (&lt;abbr title="notified body"&gt;NB&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;abbr title="notified body"&gt;NB&lt;/abbr&gt; has approved them, the products must carry the &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark and be correctly labelled with details of the manufacturer and importer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyrotechnics that were manufactured or imported before 4 July 2010 and that complied with British Standard BS 7114 can continue to be sold without the &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark until 4 July 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 3 fireworks must not exceed 120 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category 4 display fireworks that are not intended for supply to consumers must be marked accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you import fireworks, you must ensure they comply with the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; safety standards, carry the &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark and supply information at the point of entry to ensure that fireworks are legally stored and distributed. This information should be given to HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs and will then be sent to the relevant authorities responsible for storage licences so they can check on deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Licensing authorities can ask to see information relating to transactions of fireworks exceeding 50 kilograms of net explosive content.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h3 id="your-responsibilities-if-you-are-a-fireworks-retailer"&gt;Your responsibilities if you are a fireworks retailer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to sell fireworks to the public, you need to register your shop or obtain a licence from your local authority. The penalties for not registering or being licensed are a fine of up to £5,000, a prison sentence of up to 3 months, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is illegal for retailers to sell caps, cracker snaps, novelty matches, party poppers, serpents and throwdowns to anyone who is under 16 and to sell all other fireworks to anyone who is under 18 - it is recommended that proof of age is sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must display a large notice reminding customers about the law with regard to underage sales and possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only sell fireworks that conform to &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; safety standards (or British Standard BS 7114 if they were produced before 4 July 2010) and which carry the &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark and meet certain noise conditions. They must have the &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark or BS 7114 printed on each item or on the retail packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also supply fireworks with any safety instructions provided by the manufacturer or importer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boxes of fireworks must not be split and sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you have a special licence, you can only sell fireworks during the weeks leading up to Bonfire Night, New Year’s Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/explosives/fireworks/industry.htm"&gt;Find a fireworks storage risk assessment checklist and information about storing and selling fireworks in retail premises on the &lt;abbr title="Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive"&gt;HSE&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cosmetic-products-safety-regulations"&gt;Cosmetic Products Safety Regulations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All cosmetic products supplied in the UK, whether for consumer or professional use, must comply with the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 2008 (as amended). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 13 July 2013 a new directly applicable &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0059:0209:EN:PDF"&gt;European Regulation (EC/1223/2009)&lt;/a&gt; enters into force, replacing the existing legislation, (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new notification procedure, which requires every product placed on the market to be notified to the European Commission is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guidance notes explain all aspects of the Cosmetics Products (Safety) Regulations 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Regulations require that finished cosmetic products must undergo a safety assessment by a suitably qualified person before they can be placed on the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file50357.pdf"&gt;The Cosmetics Directive&lt;/a&gt; on which the Regulations are based is updated periodically, reflecting changes to the prohibitions and restrictions on certain substances, and subsequent amendments to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1284/contents/made"&gt;Cosmetics Products (Safety) Regulations 2008&lt;/a&gt; are available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/"&gt;OPSI website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amendments since then are contained, available on the same website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 31 October 2012 a new directive enters into force, which is mirrored in S.I. 2012/2263, and which liberalises the use of hydrogen peroxide at up to 6% for tooth whitening purposes, subject to first use by a dentist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition various hair dye substances are due to be restricted from 1 September 2013, under &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:208:0008:01:EN:HTML"&gt;Directive 2012/21/&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is not intending to transpose this because it will be overtaken by the new European Regulation (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-european-regulation"&gt;The European Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has firstly altered the procedure for notification of each product, requiring notification direct to the European Commission using the Cosmetics Product Notification Portal, (CPNP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is operational now and can be used, although it does not become mandatory until the Regulation enters into force: see the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/cosmetics/files/pdf/cpnp_new_en.pdf"&gt;Cosmetics Products Notification Portal document&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/cosmetics/files/pdf/cpnp_user_manual_en.pdf"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Regulation is directly applicable and it changes various elements, relating to the safety assessment, the responsible person in respect of that, and nanomaterials. There will be further guidance issued, as details which have still to be negotiated are finalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="safety-regulations-for-childrens-products"&gt;Safety regulations for children’s products&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All toys supplied in the UK must meet the requirements of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulations define a toy as ‘any product or material designed or clearly intended for use in play by children of less than 14 years of age, but excluding those products specified in Schedule 3 [of the regulations]’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file11286.pdf"&gt;download a guide to the Toys (Safety) Regulations from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 100K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that a revised European directive will come into force on 20 July 2011. The directive substantially amends the existing regulations across virtually all safety aspects. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:170:0001:0037:EN:PDF"&gt;download the text of the new Directive 2009/48/EC from the EUR-Lex website (PDF, 995K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ce-marking-on-toys"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking on toys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All toys presented for sale in the UK must bear the &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking and the name and address of the person who first placed the toy on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark is a declaration by the manufacturer that the product satisfies essential safety requirements and can be sold within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. For more information see this guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/ce-marking"&gt;&lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; marking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authority trading standards officers can remove a toy from the market if they believe it to be unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="testing-for-toys"&gt;Testing for toys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manufacture a toy in accordance with the regulations - and the standards cover all aspects relating to the toy - then it can be self-certified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the standards do not cover all aspects relating to the toy, a sample must be submitted for type examination by an approved body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you import toys you are responsible for their safety, whether or not they already bear a &lt;abbr title="compliance with EU safety, health and environmental requirements"&gt;CE&lt;/abbr&gt; mark. You might want to consider having them tested to ensure they are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="other-child-safety-regulations"&gt;Other child safety regulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other laws relating to child safety include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flammability - tough performance requirements regarding flammability are compulsory for children’s nightdresses and dressing gowns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choking risks - toys intended for children under 36 months must not present a choking risk - the test uses the ‘small parts cylinder’ (toys or parts of toys that can fit entirely inside the cylinder are identified as choking hazards)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;magnetic parts - magnets which have a flux of more than 50 kG2mm2 (0,5 T2mm2) and fit entirely in the small parts cylinder are not permitted for use in toys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chemicals - the revised European Directive 2009/48/EC will limit the amounts of certain chemicals that may be contained in materials used for toys - these parts of the directive relating to chemical content will come into force on 20 July 2013 (there is also a ban on the use of six phthalates in toys and products for children under 3 years of age)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;other products - hood cords, bunk beds and prams and pushchairs are subject to specific safety regulations, namely the Children’s Clothing (Hood Cords) Regulations 1976, the Bunk Beds (Entrapment Hazards) (Safety) Regulations 1987 and the Wheeled Child Conveyances (Safety) Regulations 1997&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="general-product-safety-regulations"&gt;General Product safety regulations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General product safety is regulated by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1803/contents/made"&gt;General Product Safety Regulations 2005 (GPS Regulations)&lt;/a&gt;. They apply to all products (new and second-hand) used by consumers. Product-specific legislation continues to take precedence in areas where the provisions have similar objectives to the GPS Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPS Regulations maintain the general duty placed on producers and distributors to place on the market (or supply) only products that are safe in normal or reasonable foreseeable use. The principal responsibility for day-to-day enforcement of the Regulations lies with local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPS Regulations recognise certain technical standards as carrying a presumption of conformity with the general safety requirement, meaning that products that comply with them are deemed to be safe. An up-to-date list of European Standards is available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/safety/euro_standards/index_en.htm"&gt;European Commission Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rapid-alert-system-for-non-food-consumer-products-rapex"&gt;Rapid Alert System for non-food consumer products (RAPEX)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAPEX is the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products – with the exception of food, pharmaceutical and medical devices which are covered by other mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It facilitates the rapid exchange of information between Member States and the Commission on measures to prevent or restrict the marketing or use of products posing a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers. Both measures ordered by national authorities and measures taken voluntarily by producers and distributors are reported by RAPEX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-does-rapex-work"&gt;How does RAPEX work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a product (eg a toy, childcare article or household appliance) is found to be dangerous, the competent national authority takes appropriate action to eliminate the risk. It can withdraw the product from the market, recall it, or issue warnings. The National Contact Point then informs the European Commission (Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection) about the product, the risks it poses to consumers and the measures taken by the authority to prevent risks and accidents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission disseminates the information that it receives to the National Contact Points of all other &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; countries. It publishes weekly overviews of dangerous products and the measures taken to eliminate the risks on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Contact Points in each &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; country ensure that the authorities responsible check whether the newly notified dangerous product is present on the market. If so, the authorities take measures to eliminate the risk, either by requiring that the product be withdrawn from the market, by recalling it from consumers or by issuing warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weekly overview of the dangerous products reported by the national authorities (the RAPEX notifications) is published on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm"&gt;Commission Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="product-recall"&gt;‘Product recall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trading Standards Central web site contains &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/advice/advice-recall-list.cfm"&gt;a list of product safety notices and recalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about the safety of a product, make your concern clear to the retailer, manufacturer or local trading standards department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a producer or distributor of consumer products on sale in the European Union (&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;), the attached guide gives you general advice about what you should do if you have evidence that one of your products may be unsafe. It is a voluntary guide to carrying out corrective actions for product safety, supported by the market surveillance authorities in Member States and consumer and trade organisations within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;.  &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/cons_safe/action_guide_en.pdf"&gt;Product Safety in Europe: A Guide to corrective action including recalls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="unsafe-product-notification"&gt;Unsafe product notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producers and distributors have a duty to notify local authorities when they become aware they have placed on the market, or distributed, an unsafe product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20100125143037/http:/www.berr.gov.uk/files/file23032.pdf"&gt;General Product Safety Regulations 2005 - notification guidance for producers and distributors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20100125143037/http:/www.berr.gov.uk/files/file23040.doc"&gt;Producer and Distributor Form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make this process simpler a business application form has been designed. There are two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the notification form - which the producer or distributor should fill in &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the online database - used exclusively by the authorities of Member States to view and process notifications (in the case of the UK the National Contact Point for RAPEX at &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidance and the form can be accessed on &lt;a rel="external" href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/gpsd-ba/index.do;jsessionid=MGycbGHrnV9ZQCdsDhYv0PLQB0GqQ7c47X4J6gqy2chSsc69nny5!443991619"&gt;the EUROPA Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authority enforcers have a duty to inform &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; of products placed on the market that either present a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serious risk in need of urgent intervention &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;non-serious risk requiring some intervention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidance for local authorities on informing &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; about products is available by following the links below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the safety aspects of your products from the outset of design can help limit your liabilities as you may find it easier to comply with current and future legislation if your products are easier to produce, use, maintain and dispose of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the research and design of your products during the early stages of development may also boost your competitiveness through a number of ways such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;efficient use of raw materials and resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improved product quality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reducing or removing hazardous materials from your processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;better preparation for the end of your product’s lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increased market share and better customer relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you are creating your product, check that no harm will be caused to makers and consumers by any of the materials or finishing techniques used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a sample of your product is ready for use, check that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is strong enough to support any loads involved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it can’t produce any toxic, harmful, or adverse effects on the user or consumer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the materials used are suitable for the purpose and safe for users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all hazards have been sufficiently controlled, eg electrical insulation, moving parts, folding components, noise and poor ergonomic design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you dispose of a product, check that the parts and materials can be dismantled without causing harm or releasing toxic or harmful substances. Ensure that the recycling of any parts or materials will not release toxic or harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly there is pressure from stakeholders such as the government, regulators, the supply chain and customers to design products that don’t have a negative impact on the environment or society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="packaging-concerns"&gt;Packaging concerns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packaging includes all products used to contain, protect, handle, deliver or present goods. It includes returnable and non-returnable items such as boxes, pallets, labels, containers, tubes, bags, sacks, timber, glass, metals, plastics and ceramics. It can also include tape, wrapping, binding and tying materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should check that your packaging is designed with safety in mind. The packaging should protect your product in transit and protect your customer from potential injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By opting to use a safety-led choice of packaging, your business will benefit from meeting legal demands, saving money and promoting an efficient image to suppliers and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;-wide Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation (&lt;abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation"&gt;CLP&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the GB’s Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009 (&lt;abbr title="GB's Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009"&gt;CHIP&lt;/abbr&gt;) govern the labelling and packaging of hazardous/dangerous chemicals. Suppliers must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify the hazards of the chemical&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give information to their customers about the hazards/dangers, usually on the package itself (such as a label) and provide a safety data sheet (SDS) if the chemicals are to be used at work (provision of an SDS comes under the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;-wide Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals Regulation - REACH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;package the chemical safely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation"&gt;CLP&lt;/abbr&gt; has applied to the labels and packaging of hazardous substances since 1 December 2010. It will apply to the labels and packaging of mixtures (called preparations under &lt;abbr title="GB's Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009"&gt;CHIP&lt;/abbr&gt;) from 1 June 2015 - however, &lt;abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation"&gt;CLP&lt;/abbr&gt; labels and packaging can be used for mixtures prior to that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="GB's Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009"&gt;CHIP&lt;/abbr&gt; Regulations were amended to bring them into line with the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;-wide &lt;abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation"&gt;CLP&lt;/abbr&gt; and REACH regulations. The eventual aim is to have a globally harmonised system for the classification and labelling of hazardous chemicals. Once the &lt;abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation"&gt;CLP&lt;/abbr&gt; requirements for mixtures apply, it is anticipated that the &lt;abbr title="GB's Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009"&gt;CHIP&lt;/abbr&gt; regulations will be repealed. For more information see the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/chemicals"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/clp/labelling_sds_en.asp"&gt;Read about safety issues for chemicals packaging under &lt;abbr title="Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulation"&gt;CLP&lt;/abbr&gt; on the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/chip/index.htm"&gt;Read about safety issues for chemicals packaging under &lt;abbr title="GB's Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009"&gt;CHIP&lt;/abbr&gt; on the &lt;abbr title="Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive"&gt;HSE&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must take further action if you want to transport dangerous goods. See the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-goods-by-road"&gt;moving goods by road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food packaging and labelling is strictly controlled to protect consumers and provide traceability. See the guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/food-labelling-and-packaging"&gt;packaging foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must keep your use of packaging to a minimum, avoid the use of heavy metals and enable packaging to be recovered. If your business handles more than 50 tonnes of packaging in a year and has a turnover of more than £2 million, you must recover and recycle set amounts of packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="product-liability-and-taking-out-insurance"&gt;Product liability and taking out insurance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a criminal offence for manufacturers to supply unsafe products. They may also be liable under civil law for any harm such products cause - which could result in costly legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Protection Act 1987 makes manufacturers strictly liable for death, injury, loss or damage caused by defective (unsafe) products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a finished product contains a defect in a particular component, both the product manufacturer and component manufacturer may be liable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file22866.pdf"&gt;download the guide to the product liability and safety provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 207K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other suppliers, such as wholesalers and retailers, are not liable unless they fail to identify the producer when asked to do so by a person who has suffered harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But customers can sue retailers under laws on the sale of goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should take positive action to monitor the safety of your products. You should also make sure you are covered by product liability insurance if you manufacture or repair products, and possibly if you sell them, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurance will provide valuable protection for your business against any costs or compensation awarded. Although it’s not a legal requirement to have this type of insurance, it could mean the survival of your business should a claim be made against you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can visit the Association of British Insurers website to download &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.abi.org.uk/Information/Business/15310.pdf"&gt;liability insurance guidance for small businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Press Release: Chief Executive Designate appointed to the Competition and Markets Authority</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Alex Chisholm was today appointed the new Chief Executive of the Competition and Markets Authority by the Business Secretary Vince Cable.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a single, streamlined authority, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will drive competition policy. There are substantial economic benefits from a tough regime cracking down hard and quickly on cartels and monopolies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that Mr Chisholm is joining the CMA as Chief Executive, to lead the organisation alongside the Chair, Lord Currie. His expertise in economic regulation and wider experience in business and the public sector will play a crucial role strengthening the UK’s world class competition regime, building on the excellent record of the Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMA Chair, Lord David Currie said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I greatly look forward to working with Alex Chisholm to make the Competition and Markets Authority a world class competition and consumer protection body, that will generate major benefits for the British economy and for consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMA Chief Executive Designate Alex Chisholm said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead the establishment of the Competition and Markets Authority, which has a vital part to play in helping competition and markets to thrive during this time of significant economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I look forward to working with the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, and with the wider government, business and consumer communities, to ensure the new authority is dynamic, efficient and accountable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Chisholm will take up his five year appointment on 25 March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="biography"&gt;Biography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since October 2007 Alex Chisholm has been Commissioner at the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) Ireland, and Chairperson of the Commission since February 2010. Since April 2011, Mr Chisholm has also served as Chair of the Economic Regulators Network in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining ComReg, Mr Chisholm held a number of executive positions in the media, IT and communications industries, including Chief Executive of Ecceleration Ltd, Ecommerce Director at eCountries Inc, Publisher and General Manager in the Financial Times Group, and Development Manager at Pearson plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also served for six years in the UK’s Department of Trade &amp;amp; Industry and Office of Fair Trading, specialising in competition policy and the media, communications and financial services sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Chisholm holds an MBA from INSEAD Business School (1997) and an MA from Oxford University (1989). In August 2012 he completed the Senior Managers in Government programme at the Harvard Kennedy School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Chisholm is also currently involved in charitable work as Trustee and Deputy Chairman of the international charity Breadline Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chief Executive will be the Accounting Officer for the CMA and a member of the CMA Board. He will lead the organisational design of the CMA and shaping of its competition processes. The Chief Executive will take ownership of the shadow organisation and along with the Chair Designate, will drive forward the creation of the CMA in bringing together the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the Competition Commission (CC) as a single, unified body by April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chief Executive’s appointment will be subject to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill receiving Royal Assent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chief Executive’s remuneration will be £190k per annum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The appointment was made on merit in accordance with the Civil Service Commissioner’s Recruitment Principles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Chisholm has no current conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government announced its plans for the creation of the CMA in March 2012. It will bring together the CC and the competition, markets and some consumer protection functions of the OFT to become a world-leading unitary authority, advocating competition both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government recognises and values the close relationship between competition problems and consumer activities.  The CMA will therefore have the OFT and Competition Commission’s full competition toolkit and consumer protection enforcement powers.  It will have the power to tackle practices and market conditions that make it difficult for consumers to exercise choice in an otherwise competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unified CMA will bring about significant benefits to business and consumers, including greater coherence, flexibility, speed and transparency in the operation of the competition regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary>How the government is changing employment laws to encourage companies to hire staff while protecting employee rights. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses say current employment laws are difficult to cope with and put them off taking on staff. This slows the growth of businesses and the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simpler, more flexible employment laws will make it easier for companies to hire and manage staff, while protecting basic workers’ rights. This should encourage employers to create new jobs, supporting enterprise and growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the labour market more flexible, efficient and fair the government is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed to review employment law in May 2010 as part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition-agreement-may-2010_0.pdf" title="Coalition Agreement"&gt;Coalition Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Tape Challenge to reduce regulations launched in April 2011 and includes a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/employment-related-law/" title="review of employment law"&gt;review of employment law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extended the time you need to be employed to be able to claim for unfair dismissal from 1 to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enterprise-and-regulatory-reform-bill-policy-paper" title="Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill"&gt;Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill&lt;/a&gt; which will make changes to the employment tribunal system, including ensuring all employment tribunal claims go to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461" title="Acas"&gt;Acas&lt;/a&gt; and introducing a simpler process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;removed the compulsory retirement age, making it easier for older people to carry on working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Regional-Mediation-Pilot-Schemes-up-and-running-67b90.aspx"&gt;pilot scheme&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the use of mediation to resolve disputes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reviewed how employment rights are enforced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-we-are-consulting"&gt;Who we are consulting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve carried out consultations on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>24+ advanced learning loans: specific learner groups</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Research on a proposal for learners aged 24 and above, studying at level 3 and above, to pay higher contributions towards costs.
</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports research findings on the government’s proposal for adults aged 24 and above, who study for qualifications at level 3 and above, to make greater contributions to the costs of their learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government proposes to remove grant funding for these further education learners and courses. This will allow the government to focus investment on younger and lower-qualified learners who are less likely to invest in themselves. Instead, the government will provide income-contingent loans to cover the resulting upfront costs, in line with its principles of promoting fairness and personal responsibility. These 24+ Advanced Learning Loans will be made available to new learners from the 2013/14 academic year, with the first full year expected to be the 2014/15 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS carried out an impact assessment to show the economic costs and benefits of this proposal, and an equality impact assessment to look at how the proposal will affect different types of learners. This report explores these assessments, and looks at how learners are likely to respond to the 24+ Advanced Learning Loans proposal, and how its impact on their decisions and behaviours could be minimised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research provides a greater understanding of four specific learner groups: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those aged 40+, and particularly those out of work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;those with mental or physical disabilities or learning difficulties have particular needs regarding communication and information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;those seeking to take up Advanced/Higher Apprentices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Muslim learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research indicated that most learner groups are unlikely to be put off by the loans proposition, provided it is communicated effectively. It also highlighted groups which are likely to face specific issues and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global Science and Innovation Network</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>Science and innovation play a key role in promoting prosperity and growth.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science and innovation are at the heart of government strategy for promoting sustainable UK economic recovery. International collaboration in science and innovation is vital for meeting policy challenges on a global scale. Challenges such as pandemic disease, climate change, and food security, require the ability to engage other governments with, and through, sound science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office jointly fund a network of Science Officers overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science and Innovation Network consists of around 90 staff, based in 40 British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates, across 25 countries around the world. SIN officers engage with the local science and innovation community in support of UK policy overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with FCO &amp;amp; BIS priorities, the work of the SIN is guided by the following objectives: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="influence"&gt;Influence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Science and innovation policies of governments, businesses and academia are influenced to benefit the UK through lobbying and deployment of robust scientific evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK policy development is informed through identifying good practice internationally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="opportunity"&gt;Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International science collaboration of best with best is facilitated to the benefit of the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;International innovation collaboration is facilitated to augment UK capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Science and Innovation Network works closely with a wide range of partners from government, business and academia. It aims to complement the work of other key partners such as UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI), The British Council, Research Councils UK (RCUK) and the Department for International Development (DFID).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sin-priorities"&gt;SIN Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priorities and activities of SIN teams will vary from country to country, but main responsibilities include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting and advising major UK partners on opportunities and developments in science and innovation overseas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Influencing key players overseas on UK aims and priorities in science and innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting overseas visits by ministers and senior officials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifying leading edge capabilities overseas, promoting UK efforts on R&amp;amp;D and breaking down barriers to collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hosting and supporting conferences, seminars and workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;I Network does not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fund or allocate resources for research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;intervene in commercial disputes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;undertake market research or commercially specific reporting&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Managing fluorinated gases and ozone-depleting substances</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are a group of chemicals containing fluorine. F-gases are powerful greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are gases which damage the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. They are being phased out, but can be found in older equipment. There are also a few exceptions for certain uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common uses for ODS and F-gases include refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, aerosols, solvents, foam blowing agents, firefighting fluids and high voltage switchgear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manufacture, supply, use, install or service equipment containing F-gases or ODS, or if you manufacture or supply F-gases, you must comply with legislation which aims to limit such releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide explains what F-gases and ODS are, how different types of businesses can comply with the F-gas and ODS legislation, and how the legislation is enforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-are-fluorinated-gases-and-ozone-depleting-substances"&gt;What are fluorinated gases and ozone-depleting substances?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are a family of gases containing fluorine. They are powerful greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. They are stronger than naturally occurring greenhouse gases and their use is regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of F-gases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;perfluorocarbons (PFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are chemicals that, if allowed to escape, damage the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. Some ODS also have a global warming potential so they contribute to climate change. F-gases are often used as a replacement for ODS. Many ODS are banned or being phased out. ODS include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon tetrachloride (used to make CFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;halons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;methyl chloroform and methyl bromide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can only produce and market ODS as a feedstock for producing non-ODS substances (eg Teflon) and for laboratory and analytical work. You must clearly label feedstock ODS and indicate that it can only be used for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some equipment still in use may contain banned or controlled ODS, and may also be traded illegally. You should be aware of which are banned, where you might find them and what to do if you discover them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="main-uses-of-f-gases-and-ods"&gt;Main uses of F-gases and ODS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-gases and ODS are used in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump (RAC) equipment are some of the largest sources of F-gas emissions in the UK. See the pages in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084061937&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;stationary refrigeration and air conditioning: F-gas controls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086763932&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;stationary refrigeration and air conditioning: ODS controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some stationary fire protection systems and portable fire extinguishers currently use HFCs. See the pages in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084062397&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;fire protection equipment: F-gas controls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086764355&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;fire protection equipment: ODS controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile air conditioning in cars and light vans currently uses HFCs. Other air-conditioned and refrigerated transport currently uses both F-gases and ODS. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063080&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;mobile air conditioning: F-gas controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solvents containing F-gases are used to clean components, eg in the electronics and aerospace industries. The use of solvents containing ODS is now banned. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063156&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;solvent cleaning: F-gas and ODS controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;F-gases and ODS have many specialist uses such as in the production of magnesium, different types of foam and high voltage switchgear. See the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063662&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;specialist uses of F-gases and ODS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information about manufacturing, importing and exporting F-gases, see the page in this guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063941&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;producing and supplying fluids: F-gas and ODS controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="f-gas-support"&gt;F-Gas Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F-Gas Support is a government-funded group that provides guidance on complying with F-gas and ODS regulations for manufacturers, operators and others working with F-gases, ODS and related equipment. You can email them at &lt;a href="mailto:fgas-support@enviros.com"&gt;fgas-support@enviros.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stationary-refrigeration-air-conditioning-and-heat-pumps-f-gas-controls"&gt;Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pumps: F-gas controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump (RAC) systems are one of the largest sources of fluorinated greenhouse gas (F-gas) emissions. F-gases commonly used in RAC systems are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) - HFC 23, HFC 134a, HFC 152a&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;perfluorocarbons (PFCs) - PFC 218, R 218, Refrigerant 218&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="responsibility-for-f-gas-obligations"&gt;Responsibility for F-gas obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the key F-gas obligations lie with the operator. An operator is a person or business who has actual power over the technical functioning of the equipment. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free access to the system, eg supervising its components or functioning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;control over the day-to-day running or function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;powers, including financial, to decide on technical modifications, F-gas quantity modifications or have repairs carried out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of the equipment is usually the operator unless such functions have been transferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-f-gas-obligations"&gt;Key F-gas obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you operate RAC equipment containing F-gases, you must meet legal obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevent leakage - where it is technically feasible and does not entail disproportionate cost, you must prevent leakage of F-gas refrigerants, and repair any discovered leaks as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check leaks regularly - how often you are required to check (using certified personnel) depends on the type of system and the quantity of F-gas refrigerants used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="leak-testing-frequencies"&gt;Leak testing frequencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Frequency&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Normal systems&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Systems labelled as hermetically sealed&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Half this frequency if fitted with automatic leak detection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system must be checked within a month after a leak has been repaired to ensure that the repair has been effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install automatic leak detection systems - you must fit a leak detection system to equipment containing 300 kilograms or more of F-gas refrigerant. This system must be checked once a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining records - you must keep records on systems with 3 kilograms or more of F-gases including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantity and type of F-gas in the system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quantity of refrigerant added to the system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quantity of refrigerant recovered through servicing, maintenance and disposal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;identity of business or personnel servicing or maintaining the system, and the dates and results of leak checks and leak detection system checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recover gas - if F-gas refrigerant is removed from any system, it must be properly recovered by appropriately certified personnel during servicing and decommissioning. You must also ensure that all F-gases that are not recycled or reclaimed are disposed of correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get certified - any personnel carrying out leak checking, gas recovery, installation, maintenance or servicing of equipment containing F-gas must be appropriately qualified. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/documents/fgassupport-rac5.pdf"&gt;Download RAC qualification and certification guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website (PDF, 325K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person physically taking delivery of F-gas containers does not need to be qualified unless they also perform installation, servicing or repair work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold company certificates - businesses that install, maintain or service the equipment must also hold the relevant company certification. The designated certification bodies in the UK are Refcom, Quidos, Bureau Veritas and Stroma. To get a company certificate you must be able to show that your staff who perform the relevant work hold the correct F-gas qualification, you have the correct tools and procedures available and you have enough staff to cover the work you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/documents/fgassupport-rac5.pdf"&gt;Download guidance on company certification in the RAC sector from the Defra website (PDF, 325K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Label systems - new systems must be correctly labelled, stating the type and quantity of refrigerant used. The label must be located near to the service point. In addition, instruction manuals that come with the equipment must have similar information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit reports - you must complete a report and send it to the European Commission and Defra if you produce, import or export more than 1 tonne of F-gases per year. This is only relevant for imports from and exports to countries outside the European Union. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/fluor/reporting_en.htm"&gt;Find the F-gas standard reporting template on the Europa website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t use non-refillable containers - use of non-refillable containers for transporting and storing F-gases is banned. You must not place non-refillable containers on the market, except for those manufactured (filled with refrigerant) before 4 July 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="alternatives-to-f-gases"&gt;Alternatives to F-gases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may wish to consider alternatives to F-gases. However, alternatives may also have restrictions on their use and you should consider the overall environmental impact (eg taking into account energy efficiency) and factors such as health and safety when making your choice. Commonly used alternative refrigerants include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ammonia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hydrocarbons, eg butane and propane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/srac/"&gt;find guidance on F-gas and ODS controls on RAC systems on the Defra website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.realzero.org.uk/"&gt;Read about minimising leaks and carbon emissions from refrigeration systems on the Real Zero website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stationary-refrigeration-air-conditioning-and-heat-pumps-ods-controls"&gt;Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pumps: ODS controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) were once widely used in the manufacture of refrigeration and air conditioning systems. The substances most commonly used were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hydrochlorofluorcarbons (HCFCs), including HCFC blends&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;halons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, refrigeration equipment also used insulating foam that contained ODS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply and use of CFCs and halons in refrigeration equipment is banned throughout the European Union (EU). This means that you can’t use them in the manufacture of new equipment or to maintain existing equipment. If you have equipment designed to use CFCs, you should have stopped using this type of refrigerant by either retro-filling existing systems with an alternative or replacing old equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virgin HCFCs can’t be used in any new refrigeration equipment or to maintain and service existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For plant maintenance until 31 December 2014 you may use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reclaimed HCFC refrigerants that have been labelled as reclaimed with information on the batch number and details of the reclamation facility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recycled HCFC refrigerants recovered from similar equipment by those carrying out the servicing operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you manufacture or maintain refrigeration equipment you must make sure you don’t use banned ODS. You should always try to use alternatives to CFCs and HCFCs, such as hydrofluorocarbons. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file29101.pdf"&gt;download guidance on CFC and HCFC phase-out and alternatives in refrigeration and air conditioning systems from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you own or operate stationary refrigeration or air conditioning equipment you must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use only permitted refrigerants in servicing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make efforts to prevent, minimise and repair any refrigerant leaks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make sure ODS are recovered when servicing, maintaining and decommissioning equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow only qualified technicians to maintain and decommission equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transport ODS in refillable containers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;label containers as reclaimed ODS, with the batch number and source of the ODS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="test-for-leaks"&gt;Test for leaks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must test for leaks regularly - how often you are required to check (using certified personnel) depends on the type of system and the quantity of ODS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Frequency&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Normal systems&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Systems labelled as hermetically sealed&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Less than 3 kilograms&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;300 kilograms or more&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;300 kilograms or more&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Half this frequency if fitted with automatic leak detection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system must be checked within a month after a leak has been repaired to ensure that the repair has been effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hold-qualifications-to-work-with-ods"&gt;Hold qualifications to work with ODS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must hold a minimum qualification to carry out specific tasks on certain types of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment if it contains ODS. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/216/schedule/1/made"&gt;Find a list of qualifications in schedule 1 of the Ozone-Depleting Substances (Qualifications) Regulations 2009 on the Legislation.gov.uk website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dispose-of-refrigeration-equipment-containing-ods-safely"&gt;Dispose of refrigeration equipment containing ODS safely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dispose of equipment containing ODS you must comply with the duty of care for waste and use a specialist fridge disposal business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.wastedirectory.org.uk/"&gt;Find licensed waste sites on the NetRegs Waste Directory website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, local traders or charities may accept refrigeration equipment that is in good working order. Check your local telephone directory for details. Refrigeration units may be refurbished for sale anywhere within the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local councils do not have to accept waste refrigeration equipment from businesses, but they may be able to offer advice. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;topicId=1074537118"&gt;Find contact details for your local authority in our Contacts Directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fire-protection-equipment-f-gas-controls"&gt;Fire protection equipment: F-gas controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are used in certain types of fire protection systems - such as specialised buildings serving computers or telecommunications. F-gases used in fire protection systems include hydrofluorocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of perfluorocarbons in firefighting equipment is now banned, except for military and aviation uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responsibility-for-f-gas-obligations-1"&gt;Responsibility for F-gas obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the key F-gas duties lie with the operator. An operator is a person or business who has actual power over the technical functioning of the equipment. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free access to the system, eg supervising its components or functioning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;control over the day-to-day running or function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;powers, including financial, to decide on technical modifications, F-gas quantity modifications or have repairs carried out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of the equipment is usually the operator unless such functions have been transferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-f-gas-obligations-1"&gt;Key F-gas obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an operator of fire protection equipment, you must comply with a number of obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevent leakage - where it is technically possible and does not involve disproportionate cost, you must prevent leakage of F-gas from stationary fire protection systems and repair any discovered leaks as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check for leaks regularly - how often you are required to check (using certified personnel) depends on the quantity of F-gases in the system and whether a leak detection system has been installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="leak-testing-frequencies-1"&gt;Leak testing frequencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Frequency&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Half this frequency if fitted with automatic leak detection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system must be checked within a month after a leak has been repaired to ensure that the repair has been effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install automatic leak detection systems - you must fit a leak detection system to equipment with 300 kilograms or more of F-gases is fitted with a leakage detection system. This system must be checked once a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing in accordance with the BS EN15004 standard will satisfy the F-gas obligations, as all gaseous fire protection systems should be checked every six months to meet the standard’s requirements. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/Post.aspx?id=161025&amp;amp;epslanguage=EN&amp;amp;pid=000000000030116814"&gt;Find BS EN15004 information on the British Standards Institution (BSI) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintain records - you must keep records on systems with 3 kilograms or more of F-gases including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantity and type of F-gas in the system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quantity of F-gas added to the system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quantity of F-gas recovered through servicing, maintenance and disposal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;identity of business or personnel servicing or maintaining the system, and the dates and results of leak checks and leak detection system checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recover gases - if F-gases are removed from any fire protection system or fire extinguisher, they must be properly recovered by appropriately certified personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold personnel qualifications - any personnel carrying out leak checking, gas recovery, installation, maintenance or servicing of equipment containing F-gases must hold an appropriate recognised qualification issued in the UK or the rest of the European Union (EU). &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fia.uk.com/en/Training/"&gt;Read about the F-gas fire protection system qualification on the Fire Industry Authority (FIA) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person physically taking delivery of F-gas containers does not need to be qualified unless they also perform servicing or repair work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold company certificates - businesses that install, maintain or service the equipment must also hold a company certificate. The designated certification body in Great Britain is the FIA. To get a company certificate you must be able to show your staff hold the correct F-gas qualification, you have the correct tools and procedures available and you have enough staff to cover the work you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labelling - new systems must be correctly labelled, stating the type and quantity of refrigerant used. The label must be located near to the service point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit reports - producers, importers or exporters of more than 1 tonne per year of F-gases must complete a report and send it to the European Commission and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). This is only relevant for imports from and exports to countries outside the EU. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/fluor/reporting_en.htm"&gt;Find the F-gas standard reporting template on the Europa website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t use non-refillable containers - use of non-refillable containers for transporting and storing F-gases is banned. The placing on the market of non-refillable containers is banned, except for those manufactured (filled with F-gas) before 4 July 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/fire-protection/"&gt;find further guidance on F-gas obligations relating to fire protection equipment on the Defra website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fire-protection-equipment-ods-controls"&gt;Fire protection equipment: ODS controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozone-deleting substances (ODS) were once used widely in firefighting equipment. Halons were used to fill equipment like hand-held fire extinguishers and built-in total flooding systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of halons in firefighting equipment is now banned, except for military and aviation uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ods-obligations"&gt;ODS obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you discover any old firefighting equipment filled with halons or other ODS you must decommission it and dispose of the equipment safely as hazardous waste. Fire extinguishers should be labelled on the outside with what they are filled with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file29105.pdf"&gt;download guidance on the phasing out of halons from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) website (PDF, 361K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To decommission fire protection systems and fire extinguishers, you must use a technician who holds the following qualifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British Fire Protection Systems Association Competence Certificate Course, Class I&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fire industry Competence Certificate Course, Class I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must dispose of the equipment as hazardous waste at a licensed facility. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;topicId=1080466581"&gt;managing your hazardous waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://wastedirectory.netregs.gov.uk/"&gt;search a directory of authorised waste sites on the NetRegs Waste Directory website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mobile-air-conditioning-f-gas-controls"&gt;Mobile air conditioning: F-gas controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are legal controls on fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) in mobile air conditioning (MAC) equipment in cars and light vans. These will affect your business if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manufacture cars or vans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supply MAC or refrigerant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maintain cars and vans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;service MAC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="servicing-and-dismantling-obligations"&gt;Servicing and dismantling obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you service and dismantle MAC systems already installed in vehicles, you must comply with a number of obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recover gases - only appropriately qualified personnel must remove F-gases from MAC systems during maintenance and at the end of the vehicle’s life to ensure the F-gases are recycled, reclaimed or destroyed. You must also recover residual F-gases from refillable and non-refillable containers to ensure they are recycled, reclaimed or destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check and repair leaks - it is good practice to check for leaks in MAC systems regularly. If you find abnormal leakage you must not refill the system until the leak is repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t use non-refillable containers - use of non-refillable containers for transporting and storing F-gases is banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have qualified personnel - any personnel carrying out F-gas recovery from MAC equipment during servicing or dismantling must have an appropriate qualification. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/documents/fgassupport-mac5.pdf"&gt;Download MAC qualification and certification guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website (PDF, 211K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business must not take delivery of F-gas containers unless your personnel who recover gases are appropriately qualified. The person physically taking delivery of F-gas containers does not need to be qualified unless they also perform servicing, repair or recovery work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="new-vehicle-obligations"&gt;New vehicle obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must not sell new cars or light vans fitted with air-conditioning systems containing refrigerants with a global warming potential of more than 150 unless they meet refrigerant leakage rates for their air conditioning systems. These are 40 grams per year for single evaporator systems and 60 grams per year for dual evaporator systems. The use of these refrigerants will be phased out between 2011 and 2017, by vehicle type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key refrigerant affected is HFC-134a. It is also called Genetron 134a, HFA-134a, HFC-134a, Forane 134a, KLEA 134a, R-134a, Suva 134a and Norflurane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/mobile-air-conditioning/"&gt;find guidance for MAC service and manufacturers on complying with F-gas regulations on the Defra website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="solvent-cleaning-f-gas-and-ods-controls"&gt;Solvent cleaning: F-gas and ODS controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solvent users need to comply with certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gas) and ozone-depleting substance (ODS) obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ods-obligations-1"&gt;ODS obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of solvents containing ODS is banned for any solvent cleaning activities, eg of electronic circuit boards, high precision metal components (used in sectors like aerospace) and optical components. This includes hydrochlorofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, chlorobromomethane and carbon tetrachloride. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file29104.pdf"&gt;Download guidance on phasing out of ozone-depleting solvents from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) website (PDF, 353K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you discover any ozone-depleting solvents you must dispose of them safely as hazardous waste. See our guide on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;topicId=1080466581"&gt;managing your hazardous waste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="f-gas-obligations"&gt;F-gas obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and certain hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as HFC-4310mee and HFC-365mfc are used as solvents and are covered by F-gas obligations. Trade names for these products include Vertrel, Lenium ‘F’ Series, Solvokane, Electrolube and Flutec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some F-gas solvents have a high global warming potential (GWP). GWP measures the strength of a gas in warming the atmosphere. This is a measure of how many times more powerful the gas is in contributing to global warming than CO2. CO2 has a GWP of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should check with your supplier whether you use solvents containing F-gases that are covered by F-gas regulations and what the GWP of the solvent is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the GWP of a solvent is at or near 150 as it is used its GWP may increase above the 150 threshold and the obligations in the F-gas regulations will apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use F-gas solvents covered by F-gas regulations you must comply with a number of obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recover solvent - only appropriately qualified personnel must recover F-gas solvent from equipment during plant servicing and maintenance and at their end of life. You must also send recovered solvents for reprocessing or destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t knowingly release solvents - You must not knowingly release F-gas solvent vapours to the atmosphere or pour solvents into the drains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold personnel qualifications - any personnel carrying out solvent recovery activities must hold an appropriate recognised qualification issued in the UK or the rest of the European Union (EU). The designated certification body is Fraser Technologies Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business must not take delivery of F-gas containers unless your personnel who recover solvents are appropriately qualified. The person physically taking delivery does not need to be qualified unless they also perform recovery work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="specialist-uses-of-f-gases-and-ods"&gt;Specialist uses of F-gases and ODS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some specialist manufacturing activities use fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) or ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Ensure that you comply with any F-gas or ODS obligations that apply to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="metered-dose-inhalers-mdis-and-electronics-manufacturers"&gt;Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and electronics manufacturers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manufacture or supply MDIs, or produce electronics components, you must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;report annually to the European Commission if you are directly importing more than 1 tonne of F-gas from outside the European Union (EU), and send a copy to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recover any F-gas fluid at the end of life of containers used to supply F-gases, but not MDIs themselves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;employ appropriately qualified staff if you perform recovery work and take delivery of containers of F-gas - the person physically taking delivery doesn’t need to be qualified if they don’t perform recovery work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="aerosols-and-one-component-foam-ocf"&gt;Aerosols and One Component Foam (OCF)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCF manufacturers must no longer use F-gases. OCF importers and distributors must not source OCF manufactured after 4 July 2008 that contain F-gases. Retailers must not sell OCF containing F-gas if it was manufactured after 4 July 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using F-gas as a propellant in novelty aerosols is also banned. However, it can still be used in technical aerosols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="magnesium-smelters-and-sand-casters"&gt;Magnesium smelters and sand casters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Die casters are banned from using sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), except where they use less than 850 kilograms per year (kg/year). If you are a magnesium smelter or sand caster using less than 850kg/year of SF6, you should still consider using an alternative gas. This will have less impact on global warming and may also save you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business performs recovery work and takes delivery of F-gas containers you must employ appropriately qualified personnel to do such work. The person physically taking delivery doesn’t need to be qualified if they don’t perform recovery work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you import or export more than 1 tonne of F-gases, you must report any relevant data about the quantities to the European Commission. You must also send a copy to Defra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="insulation-foam"&gt;Insulation foam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you produce or use insulation foam containing F-gases or ODS, you must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not use chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) blowing agents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recover blowing agent from waste containers used to supply F gases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recover blowing agent at the end of life of containers used to supply F-gases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recover F-gas and ODS from waste foam, where this is technically possible and does not entail disproportionate cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;comply with obligations relating to labelling, training and taking deliveries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you directly import more than 1 tonne per year of F-gas, or preparations containing F-gas where the preparation has a global warming potential of 150 or more, for use in foam production from outside the EU, you must report it to the European Commission. You must also send a copy of the report to Defra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/documents/fgassupport-fm1.pdf"&gt;Download F-gas guidance for the foam blowing sector from the Defra website (PDF, 86K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fumigation"&gt;Fumigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of methyl bromide is banned. You are only allowed to use methyl bromide in emergencies, where unexpected outbreaks of particular pests and diseases occur. To use methyl bromide in an emergency you must first gain approval from the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) and have the support of Defra to apply for an authorisation from the European Commission. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/corporate.asp?id=74"&gt;Find CRD contact details on the CRD website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use methyl bromide you or your supervisor must have completed specific British Pest Control Association (BPCA) training modules that relate to the work. For further details, contact the BPCA Training Officer on Tel 01332 225113.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="high-voltage-switchgear"&gt;High voltage switchgear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High voltage switchgear is mainly used in the electricity supply industry. If you operate high voltage switchgear that contains SF6 you must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recover SF6 correctly from switchgear and SF6 containers during maintenance and at end of life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;employ appropriately qualified personnel if you perform recovery work and take delivery of SF6 containers - the person physically taking delivery doesn’t need to be qualified if they don’t perform recovery work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure new switchgear is fitted with clear labels that state the type and quantity of SF6, and that the equipment contains an F-gas with a high global warming potential&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not use non-refillable containers for transporting or storing SF6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is good practice to keep records for switchgear containing 3 kilograms or more of F-gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/high-voltage-switchgear/"&gt;find further F-gas information for high voltage switchgear operators and servicers on the Defra website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="producing-and-supplying-fluids-f-gas-and-ods-controls"&gt;Producing and supplying fluids: F-gas and ODS controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manufacture, import, export or supply fluids containing fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) or ozone-depleting substances (ODS) you must comply with a number of obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-f-gas-obligations-2"&gt;Key F-gas obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you produce, or import into or export out of the European Union, more than 1 tonne of F-gas per year, you must report to the European Commission before 31 March each year. You must present the information in a standard template. You must also send a copy to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/fluor/reporting_en.htm"&gt;Find the F-gas standard reporting template on the Europa website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must label F-gas containers ‘placed on the market’ showing the type and quantity of fluid. Labels must show the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;text ‘contains fluorinated greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;abbreviated chemical names of the F-gases contained&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quantity of F-gases in kilograms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;text ‘hermetically sealed’ where applicable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must make sure that the label is clearly legible, in English and securely fixed to the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other obligations relating to labels and instruction manuals. For further information, contact &lt;a href="mailto:fgas-support@enviros.com"&gt;F-gas Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluid retained in the container must be properly removed by certified personnel at the end of the container’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All personnel, including contractors or subcontractors, who carry out F-gas handling and recovery activities must be properly qualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business checks for leaks, maintains or services refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pump equipment or fire protection systems containing F-gases, or recovers F-gas from certain types of equipment, you can only take delivery of F-gas if the personnel doing the work are appropriately qualified. The person physically taking delivery doesn’t need to be qualified if they don’t perform recovery work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of non-refillable containers for transporting or storing F-gas is banned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-ods-obligations"&gt;Key ODS obligations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases the import and export of ODS is banned. Where they are permitted, trade can only be conducted with approved countries. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/faq.htm#article5"&gt;check a list of countries approved for trade in ODS on the Europa website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only import and export ODS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for laboratory and analytical uses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to be used as a feedstock or as a processing agent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to be destroyed and reclaimed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for metered dose inhalers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for critical uses, eg halons in firefighting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for emergency use (methyl bromide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must not import products and equipment, such as refrigerators, that contain or rely on banned substances unless they are products containing hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) to be repackaged and subsequently re-exported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importers of HCFCs or products and equipment that contain or rely on HCFCs need a licence. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/ods_import.htm"&gt;find out how to become a licensed importer of ODS on the Europa website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Products and equipment that contain or rely on ODS cannot be exported unless they are for laboratory, analytical or destruction purposes. Some metered dose inhalers containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can also be exported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are able to export your goods you will need a licence. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/ods_export.htm"&gt;find out how to become a licensed exporter of ODS on the Europa website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only ODS you can repackage and export for these purposes are HCFCs until 31 December 2020. The HCFCs must have been repackaged before 31 December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you repackage and export HCFCs you must have a licence from the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manufacture or supply chemical substances you must comply with the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations (CHIP) and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP) Regulation. See the page on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087521619&amp;amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;type=RESOURCES"&gt;classifying and labelling chemicals&lt;/a&gt; in our guide &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;amp;topicId=1087520983"&gt;hazardous substance responsibilities for chemical manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-f-gas-and-ods-regulations-are-enforced"&gt;How F-gas and ODS regulations are enforced&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several organisations enforce the fluorinated greenhouse gas (F-gas) and ozone-depleting substance (ODS) regulations. If you do not comply you can be fined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations regulating F-gas and ODS equipment and processes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulating organisation Type of equipment/machinery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local councils
Commercial and retail businesses/
Industrial sites not covered by the Environment Agency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environment Agency
Industrial facilities with environmental permits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
Offshore oil, gas, water and wind installations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulating organisations can ensure compliance with F-gas and ODS legislation by serving information notices, enforcement notices or prohibition notices. Failure to comply with a notice can result in a fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="information-notices"&gt;Information notices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These may be issued to people by regulators in order to obtain further information within set deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enforcement-notices"&gt;Enforcement notices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators issue enforcement notices if they suspect that businesses are in breach of the regulations. They include a description of the problem, how it can be solved and the date by which it must be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prohibition-notices"&gt;Prohibition notices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators can serve prohibition notices if they believe specific requirements of the regulations have been or are in danger of being breached, leading to an imminent danger of serious pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prohibition notices include a description of the problem, how it can be solved and the date by which it must be fixed. They may require you to take action immediately. Prohibition notices can include an order to close down a piece of equipment or a whole site. They will explain the damage that pollution is causing.&lt;/p&gt;
