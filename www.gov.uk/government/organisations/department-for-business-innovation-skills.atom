    <title>Press Release: Graduate apprenticeships for the professions introduced</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduate and post-graduate level apprenticeships will soon be available in subjects including law, accountancy and advanced engineering, Skills Minister Matthew Hancock announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From next year, changes to the Specification of Apprentices Standards for England (SASE) will mean that level six and seven apprenticeships – equivalent to bachelors and masters degree level – are available for the first time, making vocational learning an attractive alternative to the traditional higher education route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already a number of these top-level schemes in development, including in accountancy, law and human resources. BPP Law School is looking to develop a Legal Apprenticeship pathway which could be an alternative route to the legal profession and qualification as a solicitor. It is in discussion with the relevant regulatory body and sector skills council, Skills for Justice, to progress its proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past, apprenticeships were restricted to only some trades, and some parts of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now we are introducing apprenticeships in all types of jobs, including a new route to the professions, to ensure everyone can reach their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These new apprenticeships will help more young people to receive on-the-job training at top companies like BPP Law School, ensuring a vocational route to success in accounting, insurance, and the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director of BPP Professional Apprenticeships James Hammill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are committed to improving social mobility and diversity in the work place by opening up some of the most prestigious professions and employers to school leavers as an alternative to the traditional route. Apprenticeships are an excellent way for employers to recruit talent early and design a structured training programme that incorporates technical learning as well as invaluable work based skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BPP Law School is based in eight UK cities: Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Swindon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Press Release: Know your shopper's rights before you hit the winter sales</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Boxing Day sales begin and January sales loom, Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson is urging consumers to shop responsibly and be aware of their rights to a refund or exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent figures show that more shoppers are choosing to buy their festive treats online, but with internet shopping and many other methods of buying, it can be difficult for consumers to know exactly what the rules are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jo Swinson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The festive period is the one time we happily push away scrooge-like thoughts and shop for gifts for our loved ones or to take advantage of the wide range of sales. We are increasingly being spoilt for choice with a wide range of goods, services and shops to choose from, but the variety of choice can mean that consumers forget to take note of the different shoppers’ rights that apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge consumers to take note of when they are entitled to a refund or exchange, and to bear in mind any restrictions on certain purchases. When shoppers do buy something, and later change their mind or have a problem with the purchase, I want them to be aware of their rights and obligations to make sure they can get their money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The current laws that apply to buying goods and services need to be clearer, as do the rules on shopping online or buying digital content. The proposed Consumer Bill of Rights aims to clarify and modernise the law, ensuring consumers are confident about their rights across all areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="general-rules"&gt;General rules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a consumer buys goods, they must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, last a reasonable time and match any description given. If they don’t the consumer can usually get either a repair, replacement, refund or partial refund. The consumer has the right to any claim for 6 years from purchase, or 5 years in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to be aware that sometimes these rights won’t apply. For example if a consumer just changes their mind they will not have the same rights unless the shop they bought from offers them under its own store policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="return-deadlines"&gt;Return deadlines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers have a “reasonable time”, often around 4 weeks (although it may be less, depending on the goods in question), to return faulty goods and get a full refund. After this, they may only be entitled to an exchange or partial refund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="faulty-goods"&gt;Faulty goods&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If goods are faulty, consumers don’t need to have a receipt to return the item, just proof of purchase. However they may not be entitled to a refund if the fault is due to normal wear and tear, or if the consumer damages the item themselves. This will also be the case where the consumer was aware of the fault before they bought the item. If a consumer keeps the goods for too long before telling the shop or trying to fix the problem themselves, they might not be entitled to get all of their money back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="sale-items"&gt;Sale items&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers have the same rights for sale items as they do for full price items. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="gifts"&gt;Gifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most shops offer gift receipts, legally only the person who paid has a right to return faulty goods.  To avoid any hassle it’s best to use gift receipts where available, or get the trader to write ‘‘this is a gift for —’’ on any receipt or invoice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="dangerous-or-unsafe-goods"&gt;Dangerous or unsafe goods&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an item is suspected to be dangerous or unsafe, the individual should stop using it immediately. Dangerous or unsafe goods should be reported to Trading Standards on 08454 04 05 06.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="private-purchases"&gt;Private purchases&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a shopper buys directly from a private seller, they cannot get their money back if the goods are not satisfactory or fit for purpose. They do however have the right to get their money back if the item doesn’t match the description, e.g. if the seller says the item works and it doesn’t. Consumers should always ask for a receipt and contact details from sellers where they can, and keep copies of any relevant adverts or website pages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="online-auction-sites"&gt;Online auction sites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general shopper’s rights apply when buying from a seller who makes some or all of their income from selling through online auction sites. If the seller is just an occasional private seller, the more limited rules of private purchases apply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="online-mail-order-and-telephone-shopping"&gt;Online, mail order and telephone shopping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers who opt for these buying methods have extra rights in addition to the general rights. If they buy a service they can cancel their order up to 7 working days after making it, and if they buy goods they can cancel 7 working days after receiving the item. Consumers can claim a refund if they don’t receive their item within 30 days. However, consumers can’t return certain goods that they have changed their mind about, including opened CDs or DVDs, food, personalised goods, newspapers and magazines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buying online consumers should be able to see certain information about the seller, the goods, and the seller’s terms and conditions on the seller’s website. To see exactly what information required visit Citizen’s Advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="future-proposals"&gt;Future proposals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, BIS consulted on proposals for a new Consumer Bill of Rights, which will set out a clear code of shopping rights with workable remedies when things go wrong.  It will empower consumers, making it easier for them to understand their rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify the nature of consumers’ rights and remedies in relation to the supply of goods, which is currently an area where the law is unnecessarily complex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring the services regime more in line with the regime for goods, by strengthening consumer rights and remedies in relation to faulty services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modernise the law on digital content to protect consumers, by establishing a clear digital content regime with its own tailored set of rights and associated remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will also be one clear set of rules governing public investigations of breaches of consumer law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Bill of Rights consultation closed in October, and the government will respond in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on the repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is seeking views on the possible repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 (PMA). The PMA makes it an offence to make false or misleading statements in the course of an estate agency or property development business about property offered for sale. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) provide similar protections for consumers. This duplication may be unnecessary; putting additional burdens on business, without providing additional protection for consumers. The consultation considers whether the Government should repeal the PMA, now that the CPRs are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Processes for dealing with anti-competitive activity</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>A guide to how we deal with anti-competitive activity in business. Includes information on competition authorities and sectoral regulation</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive markets provide the best means of ensuring that the economy’s resources are put to their best use by encouraging enterprise and efficiency, widening choice and contributing to our international competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, timely and effective enforcement is essential to identify any anti-competitive practices or structures that may develop and lead to a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/general/oft911.pdf"&gt;loss of competition in markets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/speeches/spe0304.pdf"&gt;abuse of market power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="current-competition-authorities"&gt;Current competition authorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills sets the overall policy framework for competition, it is regulated by the UK’s independent competition authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 main competition bodies responsible for investigating and enforcing decisions on competition matters in the UK market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-office-of-fair-trading"&gt;The Office of Fair Trading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/"&gt;Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; is the principal competition authority. Its responsibility is to enforce competition and make markets work well for the benefit of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; derives most of its powers from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents"&gt;Enterprise Act 2002&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/41/contents"&gt;Competition Act 1998&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; investigates mergers and anti-competitive practices in markets and also enforces consumer law – see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/competition_law/oft442.pdf"&gt;Modernisation – Understanding Competition Law&lt;/a&gt; for further information. Large mergers with a European dimension may be covered by the European Community Merger Regulation (&lt;abbr title="European Community Merger Regulation"&gt;ECMR&lt;/abbr&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-competition-commission"&gt;The Competition Commission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/"&gt;Competition Commission (&lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; conducts in-depth inquiries into mergers, markets and the regulation of certain industries such as utilities and communications. However, the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; only undertakes its inquiries where they have been referred by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;, one of the sectoral regulators, or in exceptional circumstances the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-competition-appeal-tribunal"&gt;The Competition Appeal Tribunal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.catribunal.org.uk/"&gt;Competition Appeal Tribunal (&lt;abbr title="Competition Appeal Tribunal"&gt;CAT&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; is a specialist judicial body whose function is to hear and rule on appeals of decisions made by the competition authorities. The &lt;abbr title="Competition Appeal Tribunal"&gt;CAT&lt;/abbr&gt; has a cross-disciplinary expertise in law, economics, business, competition and economic regulatory issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-european-commission"&gt;The European Commission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; (Directorate General for Competition) has exclusive powers to act on certain large mergers with a European dimension. It also has powers to investigate anti-competitive practices when trade between members of the European Community, or in some cases the European Economic Area (EEA), is affected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="sectoral-regulators"&gt;Sectoral regulators&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of sectoral regulators have a specific role in promoting or facilitating competition within their sectors. Some also have the power to apply the Competition Act 1998 concurrently with the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;. The regulators with such ‘concurrent powers’ are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/OfgemHome.aspx"&gt;Ofgem&lt;/a&gt; - in the energy markets &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/"&gt;Ofwat&lt;/a&gt; - in the water industry &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt; - in the communications sector &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Office of Rail Regulation"&gt;ORR&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - for railway services &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.caa.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - in relation to air traffic services &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.niaur.gov.uk/"&gt;Utility Regulator&lt;/a&gt; - for gas and electricity in Northern Ireland &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/monitors-new-role"&gt;Monitor&lt;/a&gt; - for NHS Foundation Trusts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="oft-market-studies-and-cc-market-investigations"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; market studies and &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; market investigations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;) market studies are detailed investigations of markets that are not operating well for consumers, but where neither consumer regulation enforcement by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; nor competition enforcement through a referral to the Competition Commission (&lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;) is likely to resolve the issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where those studies make recommendations to government, the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;) co-ordinates government responses and ensures that they take account not only of competition and consumer interests but wider public policy objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market studies will usually be performed under section 5 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020040_en_1"&gt;Enterprise Act 2002&lt;/a&gt; in order to identify whether perceived problems should be addressed through the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s other functions. There is a range of possible outcomes of a study including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving the market a clean bill of health (ie a decision that intervention is not appropriate on the evidence available) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;publishing information to help consumers &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encouraging firms to take voluntary action &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encouraging a consumer code of practice &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making recommendations to the government or regulators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;investigation or enforcement action against companies or individuals suspected of breaching consumer law or competition law &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a market investigation reference to the Competition Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; conducts in-depth inquiries into markets – market investigations – undertaken in response to a reference made by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; or sectoral regulator and, in certain limited circumstances, by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. The market studies and market investigations where &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has played an active role are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;medicines distribution &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pharmaceutical price regulation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sale and rent back &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;payment protection insurance &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supply of airport services in the UK by BAA &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rolling stock leasing (ROSCOs) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;property searches &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mergers"&gt;Mergers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper framework for control of mergers is important to ensure that competition is not damaged when businesses come together. UK mergers are considered by the competition authorities under the Enterprise Act 2002. Public interest considerations are specified in the Act as being national security, media plurality and stability of the UK financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, mergers will be considered by the UK competition authorities if the annual UK turnover of the enterprise being taken over exceeds £70 million, or the merger creates a 25% share or more in a market for goods or services in the UK or a substantial part of it. There is no statutory requirement to pre-notify mergers to the UK competition authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investigation-by-the-oft"&gt;Investigation by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; investigates mergers in the first instance and, with the exception of public interest cases, decides whether or not they should be referred to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; for further investigation. The test is whether the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; believes a merger has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition.
In making decisions, the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; will either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refer to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; for further investigation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear the merger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear it subject to undertakings in lieu of a reference to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of mergers investigated by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investigation-by-the-cc"&gt;Investigation by the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where a merger is referred to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;, it has to determine whether it has resulted in a substantial lessening of competition and to take the action it considers reasonable and practicable to address any adverse effects arising from the merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; reports are published. Details of mergers investigated by the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt; website. Companies can also obtain &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; and informal advice from the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; on its merger procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mergers-between-water-and-sewerage-companies"&gt;Mergers between water and sewerage companies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special regime exists for mergers between water and sewerage companies. These are considered under sections 32-35 of the Water Industry Act 1991, as amended by the Enterprise Act and the Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-community-merger-regulation"&gt;European Community Merger Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large mergers with a European dimension that breach certain jurisdictional thresholds of the European Community Merger Regulation (&lt;abbr title="European Community Merger Regulation"&gt;ECMR&lt;/abbr&gt;) – Council Regulation No. 139/2004 – fall to the European Commission for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, mergers involving enterprises with an aggregate worldwide turnover of more than €5 billion (around £4 billion) and where the aggregate Community-wide turnover of each of at least 2 of the enterprises concerned is more than €250 million (around £200 million) will be investigated by the European Commission taking into account the views of member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, those mergers where more than two-thirds of the Community-wide turnover of each enterprise concerned falls within one and the same member state, are not caught by the EC Merger Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; will normally advise the EC on competition issues it sees relevant to cases being considered under the EC Merger Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on individual cases under the &lt;abbr title="European Community Merger Regulation"&gt;ECMR&lt;/abbr&gt; can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html"&gt;Commission’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="public-interest-cases-under-the-ec-merger-regulation"&gt;Public interest cases under the EC Merger Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State may also intervene on public interest grounds in mergers being considered under the EC Merger Regulation, where the public interest consideration in question is also recognised in the EC Merger Regulation. In such cases the European Commission will continue to consider the competition issues whilst the UK authorities consider public interest aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-processes-and-competition-authorities-from-april-2014"&gt;New processes and competition authorities from April 2014&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s 2011 &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-competition-regime-for-growth-a-consultation-on-options-for-reform"&gt;consultation on competition reform&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that many aspects of the UK’s competition regime are world class, but it also highlighted some significant challenges for the current system and made a number of proposals to enhance the regime’s performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;, published in March 2012, set out the reforms that will come into effect from April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reforms - currently being considered by Parliament in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill – will bring together the best of the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; into a single Competition and Markets Authority (&lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt;) to become a world-leading competition authority, advocating competition both at home and abroad. It will have a greater role in ensuring competition in regulated sectors is being addressed, through enhanced cooperation and information sharing between itself and the sector regulators. It will make better use of public resources, and business will benefit from having a single agency to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-markets-and-mergers-regimes"&gt;1) The Markets and Mergers regimes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; is set up, we shall maintain the separation of decision-making between the 2 phases of market and merger investigations [see page 94 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;]. Currently the 2 phases of an investigation are carried out by separate organisations: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Phase 1”, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/;jsessionid=8200B8DBE569E41858F3F97E2DFC0CAF"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can undertake an initial study into a merger or market to see if there is a competition issue to be addressed. If so, it can refer the case to:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/our-work"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt;, “Phase 2”, which will carry out a deeper study to get to the nub of the problem and impose remedies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The separation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 decision-making on regulatory appeals will also be maintained and provided for in legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; will have powers, additionally, to conduct investigations into practices that impact on more than one market [see page 30 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;], such as extended warranties and other secondary point of sale practices, without the need to make multiple market investigation references. These powers will enable the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; to take a more targeted approach to tackling recurring sources of consumer complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; will have discretion to stop a proposed merger [see page 42 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;] where there are concerns the merger may be anti-competitive, and to consider with the companies involved whether the merger should be allowed to proceed. Legislation will clarify that the Authority can reverse mergers that have already taken place where this is deemed appropriate after investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also proposes to improve remedies by enabling the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; to require parties to appoint an independent third party [see page 48 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;] to monitor, arbitrate, and/or implement remedies; and by giving the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; the power to require parties to publish certain non-price information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="streamlining-and-strengthening-the-competition-tools"&gt;Streamlining and strengthening the competition tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minor change will give the Secretary of State the power to request the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; to investigate public interest issues [see page 30of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;] alongside competition issues in a market investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure greater certainty and to reduce the burden to business, the government proposes introducing or reducing statutory time limits at all stages of market investigations. This will be supported by information gathering powers at all stages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statutory time limits will also be introduced at all stages of the mergers process [see page 44 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="anti-trust-and-cartels"&gt;2) Anti-trust and Cartels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system for enforcing the legal prohibitions in anti-trust (abuse of market dominance and other anti-competitive agreements) and cartel cases (eg agreement between companies to fix prices) contained in the Competition Act 1998 (‘anti-trust’) is being strengthened. Proposals include statutory change to bolster separation between investigation and decision making and new powers for the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; to improve the efficiency of investigations and transparency of the decision making process [see page 54 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is work currently carried out by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;. Appeals against decisions by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; (and the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; once the reforms have been fully introduced) can be made to the Competition Appeal Tribunal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sectoral-regulation-and-concurrency"&gt;3) Sectoral regulation and ‘concurrency’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sectoral regulators already have the power to refer cases to the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; but rarely use them. We want to encourage the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; to be a more proactive central resource for these regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sectoral regulators have ‘concurrent competition powers’, ie they have a choice between using their own sectoral powers and making use of the 1998 Competition Act to refer issues to the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;. We want to strengthen the primacy of the Competition Act by requiring sectoral regulators with concurrent powers to consider that route first; and also to give the &lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt; the power to take Competition Act cases from the sectoral regulators where it is better placed to proceed with the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="competition-complaints"&gt;Competition complaints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a company or group of companies are acting anti-competitively, then you may wish to consider making a complaint to the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; via its special hotline and email address for complaints under the Competition Act:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition Act Enquiry Line: 08457 22 44 99
e-mail enquiries: &lt;a href="mailto:enquiries.competitionact@oft.gov.uk"&gt;enquiries.competitionact@oft.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a detailed &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/advice_and_resources/resource_base/legal/competition-act-1998/complaints"&gt;how to complain section&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; website. This gives examples of behaviour which may indicate that a company is breaching the Competition Act. It also gives information on what to do in order to complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Typhoon for Oman</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>BAE Systems has signed a contract with the Sultanate of Oman for the supply of 12 Typhoon aircraft, associated support and 8 Hawk 128 aircraft. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.baesystems.com/home" title="BAE Systems website"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; released a statement confirming that the deal is worth some £2.5 billion and equips the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.omanet.om/english/government/defence.asp?cat=gov" title="Oman Defence web pages"&gt;Sultan’s Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; with the most sophisticated aircraft on the market today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the deal the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This represents a further chapter in the historical and deep relationship between Oman and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oman’s choice of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhooneurofighter.cfm" title="Typhoon aircraft"&gt;Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; recognises the capabilities of this versatile aircraft and its long term potential to stay at the forefront of military capability for many years. Oman will be a valued member of the growing Typhoon family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This sale is an important contribution to our race for growth providing significant revenue and protecting high value jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="RAF Typhoon aircraft in flight (stock image) [Picture: Senior Aircraftman Ash Reynolds, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5809/LEU-Unclass-20120912-0850-181.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;1(F) Squadron and 6 Squadron, based at RAF Leuchars, fly Typhoon aircraft over RAF Leuchars station and St Andrews town (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The relationship between the Sultan’s Armed Forces and those of the United Kingdom is enduring. This purchase of Typhoon will serve to strengthen further the bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As with the existing Jaguar and Hawk aircraft I am confident that Typhoon will provide many years of first class service to the Royal Air Force of Oman and maintain its long and fruitful relationship with the Royal Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Secretary Vince Cable welcomed the deal and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is obviously a very good day for BAE Systems, its suppliers and the broader Eurofighter supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Office for Life Sciences</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>The Office for Life Sciences is part of BIS - it ensures a competitive UK life sciences industry and secures investment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="strategy-for-uk-life-sciences---one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has launched &lt;a href="/government/publications/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for life sciences - One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, a report which summarises progress made in the first 12 months since last year’s launch of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-1429-strategy-for-uk-life-sciences.pdf"&gt;‘Strategy for UK life sciences’&lt;/a&gt;. Health Life Sciences is one of the 11 sectors that have been prioritised as part of the government’s industrial strategy. &lt;a href="/government/speeches/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;See David Willetts’ speech relating to the report.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategy for UK life sciences is based on three pillars: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a UK life sciences ecosystem: the government is making it easier for researchers to commercialise academic research, placing clinical research at the heart of the NHS, and empowering patients to participate in research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attracting, developing and rewarding talent: the government is introducing measures to attract and nurture world-leading talent and develop scientific excellence (these measures are ensuring that the UK offers exciting and rewarding careers for clinicians, scientists and technicians from all around the world)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcoming barriers and creating incentives for the promotion of healthcare innovation: the government is introducing measures to incentivise early-stage investment and nurture the best innovations through the translational funding gap to a point at which they can secure follow-on investment - we’ll continue to reduce the bureaucracy of setting up clinical trials to ensure that patients have access to promising, cost-effective, new treatments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Year On reports the substantial progress made this year in implementing these measures. In order to strengthen networks between academia, industry and the NHS, the government is investing £1 billion a year through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS. The £180 million Biomedical Catalyst was introduced to bridge the ‘valley of death’ between the bench and the clinic, and the early response from industry is that this funding is already having the intended impact of stimulating innovative research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the progress made to date, One Year On announces the government’s commitment to the sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients over the next three to five years. This work will initially focus on cancer patients, patients with rare diseases and infectious disease. We are working across government to ensure that research, academia and industry are key players in promoting the adoption of genomic technology to provide better healthcare and help the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="life-sciences-in-the-uk"&gt;Life Sciences in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy for UK life sciences was launched alongside, and is being implemented in collaboration with, the NHS chief executive’s review: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299"&gt;Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating adoption and diffusion in the NHS&lt;/a&gt;. The update to this report, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/12/ihw-creating-change/"&gt;Creating Change: Innovation, Health and Wealth One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, was published on 10 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also published on 10 December 2012 was the latest report on the bioscience and health technology database, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/12-p90-strength-and-opportunity-2012-medical-technology-sectors.pdf"&gt;Strength and opportunity 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/sectoropportunities/lifesciences.html"&gt;The New UK Life Science Prospectus Life sciences in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has one of the strongest and most productive life sciences industries in the world, contributing to patient well-being as well as supporting growth. UK life science industries generate turnover of over £50bn and employ 167,500 people in over 4,500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry is high-tech, innovative and highly diverse, spanning pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, and industrial biotechnology and has applications across many other sectors. Through the development of innovative medicines, medical technologies and services, its businesses contribute to a stronger and fairer society, helping people enjoy better health, well-being and quality of life. They are also helping the UK improve its sustainability and increase rates of decarbonisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is building on and fostering these strengths and responding to the changing global commercial environment. We want to make the UK the location of choice for pioneering life sciences research and development (&lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt;) and manufacturing investment, so that life sciences will continue to be vibrant in the UK and a key contributor to sustained economic growth and health improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office for Life Sciences (&lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;) works closely with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, championing biotechnology and the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. We also work with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk"&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk"&gt;Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)&lt;/a&gt; and other departments, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (&lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; and the life sciences industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="views-on-the-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research"&gt;Views on the use of animals in scientific research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ipsos MORI report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/ipsos-mori-views-on-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research-september-2012.pdf"&gt;‘Views on the use of animals in scientific research’&lt;/a&gt; presents the findings of a 2012 survey on awareness of, and public attitudes towards, the use of animals in scientific research. This survey has been carried out since 1999 on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that 85% of the representative sample conditionally accept the use of animals in scientific research. While this year’s findings show a decline in overall public acceptance, it also identifies that a significant proportion of the representative sample (40%) would like to know more information about the use of animals in scientific research before forming a firm opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has challenged the scientific community to respond to these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="areas-of-work-for-the-ols"&gt;Areas of work for the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt; is focused on 2 areas: healthcare and the bio-economy. The healthcare team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical technology – devices and diagnostics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bio-economy team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agricultural biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These teams work across a range of policy areas supporting business growth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHS market access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finance and tax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bio-economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="nhs-market-access"&gt;NHS market access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Te market access team works closely with the other &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; teams, the Department of Health, and other departments and agencies. The NHS is a major contributor to economic growth, and we work together to maximise this contribution and to address any barriers to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main areas of interest for the market access team are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reforms to the NHS, including the introduction of value-based pricing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the NHS procurement strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engaging with &lt;abbr title="Department of Health"&gt;DH&lt;/abbr&gt;’s delivery of [‘Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating uptake and diffusion of innovation in the NHS’[(http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we are considering how these will create opportunities for the business environment and support the growth agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="innovation"&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our focus is to ensure that industry has the right environment to innovate and in particular to remove barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently focusing on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="regenerative-medicine"&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the impact of the £25 million &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukrmp.org.uk/"&gt;UK Regenerative Medicine Platform&lt;/a&gt; which addresses the technical and scientific challenges associated with translating promising scientific discoveries in this area towards clinical impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contributing to the House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into Regenerative Medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="medicines-licensing"&gt;Medicines licensing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the government’s commitment to consult on an Early Access Scheme for Medicines &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exploring more progressive approaches to medicines regulations, including adaptive licensing, through the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; Expert Group on Healthcare Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="clinical-trials-environment"&gt;Clinical trials environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the European Commission’s plans to replace the European Clinical Trials Directive with a Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="open-innovation"&gt;Open innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the changing &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; landscape and a growing interest in new ways of partnership working, we organised a seminar on Open Innovation in May 2012. Relevant public sector organisations including the Intellectual Property Office, Technology Strategy Board, Clinical Practice Research Datalink as well as private sector interest (AstraZeneca (PPT, 2.6 Mb), Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson discussed the opportunities of the approach to the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-projects"&gt;Infrastructure projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is co-funding 2 key investment projects to stimulate further growth and address market failures by providing incubation facilities for new companies. These bioincubators are based in Stevenage in Hertfordshire, alongside the GlaxoSmithKline &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; headquarters, and on the Edinburgh BioQuarter site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has also co-funded the Industrial Biotechnology 10,000 litre Demonstrator in Wilton, an open access facility to enable companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, to trial different biomass feedstock and processes to manufacture biobased products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stevenage-bioscience-catalyst"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.stevenagecatalyst.com/"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; will be the first purpose-built, open innovation campus for drug discovery and development. It will maximise the economic impact of academic and science expertise and foster a successful open innovation model between big pharmaceutical and small bioscience companies. It will act as a catalyst to position the UK at the forefront of scientific innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst will be located alongside the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; Headquarters in Stevenage and is being developed in stages. Phase 1 comprises the construction of BioIncubator and Accelerator buildings for early-stage bioscience companies. Phase 1 is being funded by &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;, the East of England Development Agency (EEDA), the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), GSK and the Wellcome Trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future phases will bring the catalyst up to 45,000 square metres by 2016, assuming that the market demand is as expected. This is forecast to create 1500 new jobs and stimulate the creation of up to 5 new businesses. All future phases will be commercially funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="edinburgh-bioquarter---bioincubator"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter - BioIncubator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.edinburghbioquarter.com/"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter&lt;/a&gt; is a landmark life sciences hub that is establishing Edinburgh and Scotland as one of the world’s top 10 centres for biomedical research and commercialisation. The project is a long-term life science property and commercialisation partnership between Scottish Enterprise, the University of Edinburgh, the NHS and US-based private sector partner, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. The 100-acre site already houses the University of Edinburgh Queen’s Medical Research Institute and the 870-bed Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh teaching hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and Scottish Enterprise are co-funding the creation of the BioIncubator. This investment is expected to leverage almost £210m of additional investment and create or retain over 700 high-value jobs. This will enhance the global reputation of the UK as a place for leading life science innovation, by creating an infrastructure for supporting industry to collaborate with academic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Edinburgh is aiming to produce 18 new life sciences companies over the next 5 years which will add a considerable pipeline of demand for the BioIncubator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="industrial-biotechnology-demonstrator"&gt;Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in Wilton in the Tees Valley, the new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk-cpi.com/industrial-biotechnology/demonstrator"&gt;National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/a&gt; is an open access facility of a unique scale of 10,000-litre working volume capacity. The demonstrator has 2 main applications: it can be used as a proof of concept facility to scale-up the production of materials to near commercial levels; and as a product manufacturing facility for clients experiencing temporary capacity restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator"&gt;NIBF&lt;/abbr&gt; will allow biotechnology companies to de-risk product and process development. By exploring and then optimising processes, companies will be are able to calculate the most cost-effective combination of materials; process steps and sequences; and the equipment needed to manufacture profitably. Consequently, they will minimise the risk of investing in the wrong capital equipment, using inefficient processes or facing unexpected costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Providing better information and protection for consumers</title>
    <category>Policy</category>
    <summary>How the government is changing some laws to help consumers</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government believes that consumers who are well-informed about their rights and what they’re buying are more confident and more likely to spend money. We also think that consumers who feel properly protected by the law are more likely to spend money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to give consumers more confidence - and legal back-up - to deal with bad service or shoddy goods. We also want to encourage consumers to spend money, as this will help the economy grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="consumer-bill-of-rights"&gt;Consumer bill of rights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We intend to simplify and clarify consumer law with a new bill (Act of Parliament). This will contain a clear list of rights for consumers, along with new measures to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/consumer-bill-of-rights" title="Consumer bill of rights"&gt;Consumer bill of rights&lt;/a&gt; will also contain remedies for when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="consumer-and-competition-landscape-reform"&gt;Consumer and competition landscape reform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘consumer landscape’ is the network of organisations that help consumers - Citizens Advice, for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘competition landscape’ is the network of organisations that deal with competition issues and anti-competitive activities in business – the Office of Fair Trading, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re planning to reorganise both the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/consumer-and-competition-landscape-reform" title="consumer and competition landscapes"&gt;consumer and competition landscapes&lt;/a&gt; between now and 2014, to make them both simpler to understand and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementing-the-consumer-rights-directive-201183eu"&gt;Implementing the Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/implementing-the-consumer-rights-directive-2011-83-eu" title="Consumer Rights Directive."&gt;Consumer Rights Directive (CRD)&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; measure. All &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; members have agreed to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRD gives consumers additional rights when buying in the UK and the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. We’re aiming to make the CRD part of UK law by June 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="misleading-and-aggressive-selling"&gt;Misleading and aggressive selling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/misleading-and-aggressive-selling" title="Misleading and aggressive selling."&gt;improving the rights of people who have been misled into buying something&lt;/a&gt;, or who have been pressured into buying something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="personal-data"&gt;Personal data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re helping consumers make better buying decisions by giving them improved access to the personal data companies hold about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/personal-data"&gt;midata project.&lt;/a&gt;. We’re working with business, consumer and privacy groups. The project is led by an independent data expert. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The midata project runs on a voluntary basis, but we’ll pass a law to make industry cooperation compulsory if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-buying"&gt;Community buying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers can combine their buying power to buy goods and services together. This can get them better deals. The government is supporting community buying in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by providing clear advice to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/community-buying" title="Community groups"&gt;community groups&lt;/a&gt; who want to get started&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by running the ‘Buy better together challenge’, which has a £60,000 fund to be shared amongst innovative collective purchasing projects - the challenge was won by Smarterbuys, an organisation that helps provide affordable loans to disadvantaged people so they can buy essential goods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="who-can-i-contact-for-help-and-advice"&gt;Who can I contact for help and advice?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t help with individual problems – but here are &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/consumer-protection-rights" title="Help and advice"&gt;some people who can.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till now, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/" title="Trading Standards."&gt;Trading Standards&lt;/a&gt; have worked on mainly local cases and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://oft.gov.uk/" title="Office of Fair Trading."&gt;Office of Fair Trading&lt;/a&gt; (OFT) worked on some national ones. A National Audit Office (NAO) report was critical of this split and the ‘enforcement gap’ it caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/consumer-and-competition-landscape-reform" title="Consumer and Competition Landscape Reviews."&gt;Consumer and Competition Landscape Reviews&lt;/a&gt; were published in spring 2012. They recommended a number of changes including transferring the main responsibility for consumer advice to the Citizens Advice service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consulted in June 2011 with proposals for reforming consumer institutions – the ‘consumer landscape’. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/empowering-and-protecting-consumers?cat=closedwithresponse" title="Empowering and Protecting Consumers: Consultation"&gt;Empowering and protecting consumers&lt;/a&gt; had 184 responses and closed in September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted in summer 2012 about whether we should have an ‘order-making power’ for midata. This power would give us the legal authority to make businesses release personal data to their customers. Following the consultation, we announced that we would legislate if companies didn’t release customers’ data voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-937-enhancing-consumer-consultation-supply-of-goods-services-digital.pdf" title="proposals to update and simplify consumer law"&gt;proposals to update and simplify consumer law.&lt;/a&gt;  How would they affect consumers and businesses? That consultation closed on 5 October 2012. We’ll publish the results in spring 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-937-enhancing-consumer-consultation-supply-of-goods-services-digital" title="Goods, services, digital content"&gt;Consultation on the supply of goods, services and digital content (July 2012)&lt;/a&gt; here and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/s/12-961-supply-of-digital-content-impact.pdf" title="Impact assessments on the supply of goods, services and digital content."&gt;Impact assessments on the supply of goods, services and digital content here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/12-1008-consultation-ban-above-cost-payment-surcharges" title="Early implementation of a ban on above cost payment surcharges."&gt;Early implementation of a ban on above cost payment surcharges&lt;/a&gt; This closed on 15 October with the government response due in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/12-999-consultation-implementation-of-consumer-rights-directive.pdf" title="Consumer rights consultation"&gt;implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive&lt;/a&gt; This closed on 1 November. The government response is due in spring 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/e/12-543-enhancing-consumer-confidence-effective-enforcement-consultation.pdf" title="Consumer law enforcement powers"&gt;Simplifying consumer law enforcement powers.&lt;/a&gt; The government response is expected in spring 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re consulting on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/c/12-1193-civil-enforcement-remedies-consultation-on-extending" title="Extending the range of remedies available to public enforcers of consumer law."&gt;Extending the range of remedies available to public enforcers of consumer law&lt;/a&gt;. This opened on 2 November and closes on 31 December with government response due early in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to know your views on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-were-working-with"&gt;Who we’re working with&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked with a number of partners to produce our ‘Guide for community buying groups’. All of the organisations below contributed or checked material for us:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK government oil and gas sector strategy: call for industry's views</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its industrial strategy, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (&lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;) announced that there will be, initially, 10 sector strategies, of which oil and gas would be one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry’s input is essential as &lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (&lt;abbr title="The Department of Energy and Climate Change"&gt;DECC&lt;/abbr&gt;) develop this work in partnership with Oil &amp;amp; Gas UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sector strategies will be co-developed and implemented with industry to be durable and will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be long-term in focus: developing a vision for the sector and what needs to happen from both government and business to get there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be co-created with industry: committing both business and government to specific actions to maintain and develop long-term capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take a whole of government approach: looking across all of government to identify barriers and levers which have the biggest impacts and align these to deliver growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engage across the totality of the sector: working with industry and identifying actions which benefit business across the whole supply chain whether they are large, medium or small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publication is expected in late March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry’s views are very much welcomed particularly through January 2013 and can be fed into either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="The DEpartment for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; – Tom Worsley – &lt;a href="Tom.Worsley@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Tom.Worsley@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; – 020 7215 6480&lt;/p&gt;
