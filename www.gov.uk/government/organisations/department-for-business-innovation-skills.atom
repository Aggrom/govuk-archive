    <title>  Life Sciences Strategy: one year on</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="progress"&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that the UK has generated more than £1 billion on industry and private sector investment within 12 months.  This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£500 million from GSK to build its first new manufacturing plant in almost 40 years at Ulverston in Cumbria and invest more in its two sites at Montrose and Irvine in Scotland as a direct response to the introduction of the Patent Box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£25 million leveraged in from the private sector to bridge the ‘Valley of Death’ adding to a government commitment of £49 million to 64 projects through the Biomedical Catalyst&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£294 million through the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (&lt;abbr title="UK Research Partnership Investment Fund"&gt;UK RPIF&lt;/abbr&gt;) from businesses and charities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real progress has been made working closely with companies across the sector to ensure the measures in the strategy are making a real difference to their work and their decisions to invest in and remain in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes investing £1 billion per annum through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; to boost networks between academia, industry and the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="revolutionising-the-fight-against-cancer"&gt;Revolutionising the fight against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Cameron also announced that the UK will be the first country in the world to introduce to introduce high-tech &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; mapping for cancer patients and those with rare diseases, within the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.  Up to  100,000 patients over three to five years will have their whole genome – their personal &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; code –sequenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genome profile will give doctors a new, advanced understanding of a patient’s genetic make-up, condition and treatment needs, ensuring they have access to the right drugs and personalised care far quicker than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to develop life-saving new drugs, treatments and scientific breakthroughs, which experts predict could significantly reduce the number of premature deaths from cancer within a generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has earmarked £100 million: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to train a new generation of British genetic scientists to lead on the development of new drugs, treatments and cures, building the UK as the world leader in the field. And train the wider healthcare community in harnessing this technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to pump-prime &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; sequencing for cancer and rare inherited diseases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to build the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; data infrastructure to ensure that this new technology leads to better care for patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="reaction"&gt;Reaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Science and Universities David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life sciences is one of the most truly international sectors – so if we are to continue to be a world player and compete in the global race we must do everything we can to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past year, our initiatives have attracted more than £1 billion of private sector investment to the UK. We can see clear evidence the UK is succeeding in creating the right environment to attract global investment to our shores and continue to be world leader in life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am announcing today that we are committing a further £100 million to support this sector out of the extra money for science announced by the chancellor in his Autumn Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Reducing the impact of regulation on business</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some regulations are ineffective and unnecessary. Complying with them costs businesses time and money, and can restrict growth. Red tape can also make running charities and community groups more difficult than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to ensure all regulations are fair and effective. We want to strike the right balance between protecting people’s rights, health and safety and freeing them from unnecessary bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure regulations in the UK are fair and effective, we are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;controlling the number of new regulations by &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-impact-of-regulation-on-business/supporting-pages/operating-a-one-in-two-out-rule-for-business-regulation"&gt;operating a ‘one in, two out’ rule for business regulation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We publish &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;keywords=&amp;amp;publication_filter_option=guidance&amp;amp;topics%5B%5D=all&amp;amp;departments%5B%5D=department-for-business-innovation-skills"&gt;guidance for all government policymakers&lt;/a&gt; to help design better regulations or find other options instead of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, regulations - and the inspections and bureaucracy that go with them - have piled up. Businesses say the amount of new regulation is one of their biggest problems, preventing them from growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf"&gt;coalition agreement&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2010, we said that we would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cut red tape for businesses and individuals &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not rely on rules and regulations by themselves to get things done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-were-consulting-with"&gt;Who we’re consulting with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re running a series of reviews called ‘Focus on enforcement’ to get businesses’ views on how we could improve the way we enforce regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/"&gt;Have your say on how we enforce regulations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also running the Red Tape Challenge, asking businesses and the public which regulations they think could be removed or improved. See what businesses are saying: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Tell us which regulations you think should be removed or improved.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skills for life survey reveals English and maths levels of adults</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills for Life examines the maths, English and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) levels of 16-65 year olds across England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest findings found that in some areas, around a quarter of adults have the numeracy skills of a seven to nine year old or below. In Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands and the South East, there was a boost in literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/imagelibrary/downloadmedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=6131&amp;amp;SizeId=-1"&gt;Regional breakdown of the findings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the survey, Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said that adults with poor English and maths skills should make the most of free Government help. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good English and maths are vital for getting a job and playing a full part in society. We have doubled the funding for adult English and maths because they are so important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would urge anyone who is struggling to take advantage of the provision that is on offer which now includes maths and English GCSEs for adults who missed out the first time round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These essential skills are the building blocks of a productive society and a thriving economy. I am determined that everyone - no matter where they live - should have the chance to achieve their very best.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="five-ways-we-use-maths-everyday"&gt;Five ways we use maths everyday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding offers in shops e.g. buy one get one free, two for the price of one, 20% off &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding the pay and deductions on your payslip &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning a journey by train or bus and reading timetables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take/give the right amount of medicine/pills for you or a member of your family&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work out the best mobile phone deal that you can afford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="help-available"&gt;Help available&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government has introduced a number of measures to improve the nation’s basic skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free maths and English GCSEs for adults since August&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continued funding of basic English and maths courses for adults&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New study programmes for young people from September 2013 in which students will continue to work towards GCSE A*-C in English and maths if they do not have this by 16&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consultation on the introduction of new English Baccalaureate Certificates for young people in six core academic subjects including English and maths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults wanting to brush up on their maths, English and ICT skills can contact the &lt;a href="nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/a&gt; for advice or call them on 0800 100 900 for information on courses available via the National Careers Service course directory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Strategy for UK Life Sciences – One Year On</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="check-against-delivery"&gt;Check against delivery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is an exciting time to be discussing the prospects for life sciences in the UK. We have a positive story to tell – right up to the announcements of the past week, with more than £100 million of dedicated funding for life sciences capital in the Autumn Statement and the pioneering genomics programme confirmed by the Prime Minister in Cambridge on Monday, which comes with up to £100 million more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two years ago, however, and the situation was rather different. Indeed, while today’s event is all about reflecting on the progress we’ve made in the past 12 months since the launch of the Government’s Strategy for UK Life Sciences, I’m like to start further back – with Pfizer’s decision to close its R&amp;amp;D operations at Sandwich. Learning of that decision in early 2011 – not so long after AstraZeneca had elected to shut its facility at Charnwood – provided the starkest of warnings. It brought home the major changes underway globally in the life sciences industry: the shift away from in-house R&amp;amp;D to external collaborations and partnerships; the increasing mobility of capital as other countries raise their game and, therefore, the need for an integrated approach to attract investment and maintain competitive advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the Sandwich taskforce certainly taught us a great deal about the direction in which the industry is heading. And then, in June last year, the Prime Minister hosted a valuable and interesting seminar focused on life sciences which clearly demonstrated that we need to do better to make the necessary connections between our outstanding research base, our increasingly diverse life sciences sector – one featuring a growing number of SMEs – and our clinical strengths across the National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was these fundamental insights that informed the preparation of the life sciences strategy published this time last year. In it, we determined to achieve three main things. The first was to dramatically improve collaboration between academia, industry and the NHS. The second was to boost the skills and pipeline of researchers, clinicians and technicians – without whom collaboration could not be properly realised. And the third was to foster the right business environment in the UK to encourage investment, so that we could translate discovery into real benefits for patients, support innovation through the translational funding gap, and remove bureaucratic barriers to the early adoption and diffusion of medical breakthroughs in the NHS. This week we published the Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On report, showing lots of progress is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first of these ambitions – boosting collaboration in a stronger life sciences ecosystem – the Medical Research Council has promised £130 million for work on stratified and experimental medicine, with the first round of grant recipients in stratified medicine, announced on Monday, tackling rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and Gaucher’s disease. These three awards will establish research consortia in each of these disease areas and taken in total will combine 34 academic groups and 20 industry partners with charities and patients across the UK. We are investing £1 billion per annum through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new Biomedical Catalyst, established to bridge the gap between innovative research and actual commercialisation, is already funding some great projects: to develop a new vaccine for the hospital-acquired infection C. difficile, which currently kills around 3,000 people a year in the UK; to advance a treatment for late-stage Parkinson’s that significantly reduces patients’ time in surgery; to utilise a mobile phone app that helps people with conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to manage them more effectively on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also made good progress on our second objective to support skills and talent. We’ve seen the launch of the dedicated Technical Apprenticeship Service, confirmation of the first eight Research Professorships under the aegis of the National Institute for Health Research and the successful piloting of the Society of Biology’s degree accreditation programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are committed to our third objective of having a competitive business environment. From April 2013, the Patent Box will come into force – offering a 10 per cent corporation tax rate on profits attributable to patents. To optimise the commercial environment, we are also improving the visibility and certainty of R&amp;amp;D tax relief. We hope that the introduction of an above the line R&amp;amp;D tax credit will attract large scale investment in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all exciting, tangible stuff – promising for patients, promising for business and job creation. What’s vital now is that the work of integration continues, refining a system that makes full and optimum use of every one of its constituent elements. Ours is a 10 year strategy – and it hinges on achieving success in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take public investment. The ring-fenced science settlement, agreed early on by the Coalition, was a serious commitment in these straitened times – and we have built on it since. The latest money in the Autumn Statement will build the necessary research capability for the UK to compete globally in a potential $100 billion synthetic biology market. It will fund the development of a large manufacturing facility for biologic medicines such as antibodies and vaccines – improving our marketability as the location of choice for internationally mobile life sciences companies. And it will help fund imaging and cell manufacture technologies and a clean room for the UK Regenerative Medicine Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we pumped £42 million into the life sciences sector in 2012 through the Regional Growth Fund, matched by private investment of almost £185 million. We have committed £300 million for the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund. To secure investment, universities are required to match by at least double the amount they receive from the fund from non-public sources. There are several projects relevant to life sciences around the UK that have secured funding of almost £147 million. However, we understand in the UK that financial resource alone is not enough to make us the go-to destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On increasing the take up of medical innovation on the ground, the Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure at the NIHR - or NOCRI as it is known - is starting to connect industry to the best investigators, research facilities and technologies. We know that we also need to continue improvement in study performance and there is a new 70-day benchmark for providers of NHS services to proceed from receiving a valid research application to recruiting the first patient. It has been a condition of new NIHR contracts since December 2011, and performance against this will affect further funding as of April 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this and several other measures in the strategy, we know that we will only be able to truly assess impact once they have been fully implemented. For example, earlier this week Sir David Nicholson said we know good progress is being made at a time of great change in the NHS but more always remains to be done. There are deep-seated barriers to innovation that must be changed right at the heart of the NHS. David Nicholson and the new Commissioning Board will continue to push ahead to achieve a true culture of innovation throughout the NHS which is important to patients and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message we’re seeking to transmit globally is that life sciences companies can do everything they need to in this country. They can, like Astellas Pharma, establish their headquarters here. They can, like Eli Lilly, conduct early-stage research here – exploiting UK-based expertise in an unusually broad range of disciplines, from clinical pharmacology to statistics and data sciences. Or, like GSK and Eisai, they can establish cutting-edge manufacturing plants on these shores. In the past year, the UK has received more than £1 billion of industry and private sector investment – from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Novartis and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate our capacity for pioneering research, we will of course be taking forward the large-scale genomics project – the first attempt to exploit this technology within a mainstream health system. As the Prime Minister explained on Monday, we’ll be sequencing the entire genome of up to 100,000 patients. As patterns emerge, doctors will gain more advanced understanding of cancers and inherited diseases, enabling more targeted care. A critical feature of the project, which relates to one of my earlier comments, is how it will provide the training ground for a new generation of British geneticists and will educate the wider community in harnessing genomics technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it is essential that international companies appreciate what’s available in the UK – the knowhow, the facilities, the opportunities to conduct clinical trials. That’s where UK Trade and Investment come in. Earlier this year, UKTI established the Life Science Investment Organisation to help connect international investors and companies with all parts of our life sciences sector. Later on at today’s event, the UKTI will launch a new global campaign highlighting the many opportunities to invest in and partner with our knowledge base, our SMEs, our manufacturers and our commercial supply chain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2012, I’m proud to report that there are over 380 pharmaceutical companies based in the UK, employing nearly 70,000 people, with an annual turnover of £30 billion. The medical technology and medical biotechnology sectors represent over 4,000 companies employing nearly 100,000 people with an annual turnover of around £20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task ahead is to build on this solid base by encouraging more spinouts, attracting more companies from overseas and further investment. We’ll be sticking with the strategy formulated a year ago with such wise counsel from experts such as Sir John Bell, Chris Brinsmead and George Freeman – and we’ll be continually exploring ways to make the UK the best place in the world to pursue life sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;h3 id="aviation-technology"&gt;Aviation technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS supports the aerospace and defence sector on a wide range of technology activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS ensures the international regulations and standards that are developed to minimise the impact of civil aviation are adequate, fair, contribute to the aviation industry’s sustainability and are not in conflict with the legitimate interests of UK aerospace industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires policy development, co-ordination of research activities, environmental model development, project environmental assessment and environmental forecasts and scenarios. Close co-operation takes place with the Department for Transport, which takes technical advice from us. We co-operate with the International Civil Aviation Organization, European Civil Aviation Conference expert panel on the Abatement of Nuisances Caused by Air Transport (ECAC/ANCAT), United Nations Economic Commission For Europe (UNECE), and the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aerospace-msc-bursary-scheme"&gt;Aerospace MSc Bursary Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2012 at the Farnborough Airshow, the Prime Minister announced funding for 500 Masters-level degree places in aerospace engineering over the next three years – from 2013 to 2014 onwards. The places will be jointly funded with industry, with government committing £3 million, and will help provide industry with the next generation of skilled engineers they need. The programme will be overseen by the Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Aeronautical Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information on the bursary scheme will be available soon on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raeng.org.uk"&gt;Royal Academy of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://aerosociety.com"&gt;Royal Aeronautical Society&lt;/a&gt; websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aerospace-business-leaders-and-aerospace-growth-partnership-groups"&gt;Aerospace Business Leaders and Aerospace Growth Partnership Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aerospace Business Leaders Group is the senior engagement forum to discuss issues of strategic importance affecting the sector. The Group is chaired by the Secretary of State for BIS and also attended by the Minister for Business and Enterprise and senior BIS officials. Industry is represented by a small group of the UK’s top aerospace business leaders. Having identified key strategic issues, such as barriers to growth and key competitiveness drivers, action will be taken forward through an Aerospace Growth Partnership group, chaired by the Minister for Business and Enterprise, with wider business representation across the supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="repayable-launch-investment"&gt;Repayable launch investment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repayable launch investment is a risk-sharing government investment in the design and development of civil aerospace projects in the UK. The investment is repayable at a real rate of return, usually via levies on sales of the product. Repayable launch investment is permitted for the civil aerospace under the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which charges the Secretary of State with ‘organising, carrying out and encouraging measures for the designing, development and production of civil aircraft.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 25 years the Government has invested £1.7 billion in repayable launch investment projects and during that period £2.7 billion has been received in income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="low-carbon-construction"&gt;Low carbon construction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innovation and growth team was establised in 2009 to review the construction industry to ensure it was ‘fit for purpose’ for delivering a low carbon future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review looked at the strengths of and opportunities for the UK construction industry in a low carbon economy and considered how the UK can be a world leader in this sector. This review was led by Paul Morrell, the Chief Construction Adviser, and was undertaken by a mix of industry experts and those with wider business experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="construction-statistics"&gt;Construction statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS Construction Market Intelligence (CMI) has responsibility for the collection, analysis and publication of statistics on the construction sector. We provide regular statistical analyses of building materials and overseas trade, price and cost indices and key performance indicators for the construction industry. As well as statistical advice, we work closely with economists in BIS to assist in the assessment of the construction market and in the formulation of efficient policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2010 BIS launched its ‘Growth Review Framework for Advanced Manufacturing’. The Framework document was an invitation to provide comments and evidence to help identify the challenges and barriers to manufacturing growth, to feed into the Growth Review process. The document set out the Government’s ambitions for manufacturing, developed through consultation with industry. It was supported by in-depth economic analysis and a statistical annex in order to provide a substantial evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bis-retail-strategy"&gt;BIS Retail Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS has developed a range of sector specific objectives which will be taken forward over the course of 2012 to 2013. These objectives have been developed to facilitate growth of the sector at a local, national, European and international level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/b/12-1197-bis-retail-strategy.pdf"&gt;BIS Retail Strategy&lt;/a&gt;  was developed with input from the British Retail Consortium, the Association of Convenience Stores and Gloucestershire First (the first Local Enterprise Partnership Retail Pathfinder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="retail-policy-forum"&gt;Retail Policy Forum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Retail Policy Forum (RPF - chaired by BIS’s Retail Unit) enables a representative cross-section of retailers, and their representative bodies, to talk to Government Departments and EU officials about regulations and other key policies affecting the sector at an early stage in the process. It aims to help both retailers and policy makers by minimising the burdens on retail, looking for alternatives to regulations (where appropriate) and making any regulations and enforcement as practical and sensible as possible. The RPF meets three times a year. When necessary, additional meetings are held to take an in-depth look at particular subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Retail Unit also manages a Virtual RPF of UK retailers, trade associations and others with a professional interest in retailing. Communications are mainly by email and members can join the RPF’s working groups. To apply for membership of the Virtual RPF please email the Retail Unit explaining your interest in the sector and supplying contact details, including job title, telephone number and postal address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="healthy-high-street"&gt;Healthy High Street?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/h/10-1224-healthy-high-street.pdf"&gt;Healthy High Street? A healthcheck for high streets and town centres&lt;/a&gt;  was published in November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide is a simple to use health check to alert retailers and others to early signs of potential decline in their High Street – and to do so in good time for them to take preventative action. It then offers some useful first steps, including advice on working together with others to rejuvenate the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-portas-review"&gt;The Portas review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2011 the Prime Minister announced that he had asked Mary Portas, leading retail marketing consultant, to undertake a review of the English high street. The report was published in December 2011: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/p/11-1434-portas-review-future-of-high-streets.pdf"&gt;The Portas review: an independent review into the future of our high streets&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/2120019.pdf"&gt;government’s formal response to the recommendations made by Mary Portas&lt;/a&gt; in her report was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government in March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="understanding-high-street-performance"&gt;Understanding high street performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS has also published a report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-1402-understanding-high-street-performance.pdf"&gt;Understanding high street performance&lt;/a&gt;, which explores the many factors impacting on the economic and social performance of town centres and High Streets. This study is intended to help inform government and local authority decision-making regarding town centres, high streets and local economic growth. It has also provided input to the Mary Portas review.  The executive summary is available separately: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-1433-understanding-high-street-performance-summary.pdf"&gt;Understanding high street performance: executive summary&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Processes for tackling anti-competitive activity</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive markets provide the best means of ensuring that the economy’s resources are put to their best use by encouraging enterprise and efficiency, widening choice and contributing to our international competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, timely and effective enforcement is essential to identify any anti-competitive practices or structures that may develop and lead to a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/general/oft911.pdf"&gt;loss of competition in markets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/speeches/spe0304.pdf"&gt;abuse of market power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="current-competition-authorities"&gt;Current competition authorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills sets the overall policy framework for competition, it is regulated by the UK’s independent competition authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 main competition bodies are responsible for investigating and enforcing decisions on competition matters in the UK market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/"&gt;Office of Fair Trading&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;) is the principal competition authority whose responsibility is to enforce competition and make markets work well for the benefit of consumers. The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; derives most of its powers from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents"&gt;Enterprise Act 2002&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/41/contents"&gt;Competition Act 1998&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; investigates mergers and anti-competitive practices in markets and also enforces consumer law – see “&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/competition_law/oft442.pdf"&gt;Modernisation – Understanding Competition Law&lt;/a&gt;”. Large mergers with a European dimension may be covered by the European Community Merger Regulation (ECMR). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;) conducts in-depth inquiries into mergers, markets and the regulation of certain industries such as utilities and communications. However, the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; only undertakes its inquiries where they have been referred to it by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;, one of the sectoral regulators [Link to section below] or in exceptional circumstances the Secretary of State.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.catribunal.org.uk/"&gt;Competition Appeal Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; (CAT) is a specialist judicial body whose function is to hear and rule on appeals of decisions made by the competition authorities. The CAT has a cross-disciplinary expertise in law, economics, business, competition and economic regulatory issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; (Directorate General for Competition) has exclusive powers to act on certain large mergers with a European dimension. It also has powers to investigate anti-competitive practices when trade between members of the European Community, or in some cases the European Economic Area (EEA), is affected. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="sectoral-regulators"&gt;Sectoral regulators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Sectoral Regulators have a specific role in promoting or facilitating competition within their sectors. Some also have the power to apply the Competition Act 1998 concurrently with the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;. The regulators with such ‘concurrent powers’ are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/OfgemHome.aspx"&gt;Ofgem&lt;/a&gt; - in the energy markets &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/"&gt;Ofwat&lt;/a&gt; - in the water industry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt; - in the communications sector &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/"&gt;ORR&lt;/a&gt; - for railway services &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.caa.co.uk/"&gt;CAA&lt;/a&gt; - in relation to air traffic services &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.niaur.gov.uk/"&gt;Utility Regulator&lt;/a&gt; - for gas and electricity in Northern Ireland &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/monitors-new-role"&gt;Monitor&lt;/a&gt; - for NHS Foundation Trusts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="oft-market-studies-and-cc-market-investigations"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; market studies and &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; market investigations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;) market studies are detailed investigations of markets that are not operating well for consumers but where neither consumer regulation enforcement by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; nor competition enforcement through a referral to the Competition Commission (&lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;) is likely to resolve the issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where those studies make recommendations to government. the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) co-ordinates government responses and ensures that they take account not only of competition and consumer interests but wider public policy objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market studies will usually be performed under section 5 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020040_en_1"&gt;Enterprise Act 2002&lt;/a&gt; in order to identify whether perceived problems should be addressed through the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;’s other functions. There is a range of possible outcomes of a study including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving the market a clean bill of health (ie a decision that intervention is not appropriate on the evidence available) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;publishing information to help consumers &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encouraging firms to take voluntary action &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encouraging a consumer code of practice &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making recommendations to the Government or regulators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;investigation or enforcement action against companies or individuals suspected of breaching consumer law or competition law &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a market investigation reference to the Competition Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; conducts in-depth inquiries into markets – market investigations – undertaken in response to a reference made by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; or sectoral regulator and, in certain limited circumstances, by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.
The market studies and market investigations where BIS has played an active role are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;medicines distribution &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pharmaceutical price regulation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sale and rent back &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Payment Protection Insurance &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supply of airport services in the UK by BAA &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rolling stock leasing (ROSCOs) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;property searches &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;commercial use of public information (CUPI) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supply of groceries in the UK &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find information on these and other market studies, go to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20090703093314/http:/www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/businesslaw/competition/market-studies/page17610.html"&gt;National Archives market studies pages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mergers"&gt;Mergers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper framework for control of mergers is important to ensure that competition is not damaged when businesses come together. UK mergers are considered by the competition authorities under the Enterprise Act 2002. Public interest considerations are specified in the Act as being national security, media plurality and stability of the UK financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, mergers will be considered by the UK competition authorities if the annual UK turnover of the enterprise being taken over exceeds £70 million, or the merger creates a 25% share or more in a market for goods or services in the UK or a substantial part of it. There is no statutory requirement to pre-notify mergers to the UK competition authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investigation-by-the-oft"&gt;Investigation by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; investigates mergers in the first instance and, with the exception of public interest cases, decides whether or not they should be referred to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; for further investigation. The test is whether the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; believes a merger has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition.
In making decisions, the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; will either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refer to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; for further investigation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear the merger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear it subject to undertakings in lieu of a reference to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of mergers investigated by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="investigation-by-the-cc"&gt;Investigation by the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where a merger is referred to the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt;, it has to determine whether it has resulted in a substantial lessening of competition and to take the action it considers reasonable and practicable to address any adverse effects arising from the merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; reports are published. Details of mergers investigated by the &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt; website. Companies can also obtain &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; and informal advice from the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; on its merger procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mergers-between-water-and-sewerage-companies"&gt;Mergers between water and sewerage companies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special regime exists for mergers between water and sewerage companies. These are considered under sections 32-35 of the Water Industry Act 1991, as amended by the Enterprise Act and the Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-community-merger-regulation"&gt;European Community Merger Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large mergers with a European dimension that breach certain jurisdictional thresholds of the European Community Merger Regulation (ECMR) – Council Regulation No. 139/2004 – fall to the European Commission for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking mergers involving enterprises with an aggregate worldwide turnover of more than Euro 5bn (around £4bn) and where the aggregate Community-wide turnover of each of at least two of the enterprises concerned is more than Euro 250m (around £200m) will be investigated by the European Commission taking into account the views of Member States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, those mergers where more than two-thirds of the Community-wide turnover of each enterprise concerned falls within one and the same Member State, are not caught by the EC Merger Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; will normally advise the EC on competition issues it sees relevant to cases being considered under the EC Merger Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on individual cases under the ECMR can be found on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html"&gt;Commission’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public interest cases under the EC Merger Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State may also intervene on public interest grounds in mergers being considered under the EC Merger Regulation, where the public interest consideration in question is also recognised in the EC Merger Regulation. In such cases the European Commission will continue to consider the competition issues whilst the UK authorities consider public interest aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-processes-and-competition-authorities-from-april-2014"&gt;New processes and competition authorities from April 2014&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s 2011 &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/competition-regime-for-growth"&gt;consultation on competition reform&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that many aspects of the UK’s competition regime are world class but it also highlighted some significant challenges for the current system and made a number of proposals to enhance the regime’s performance. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;, published in March 2012, set out the reforms that will come into effect from April 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reforms – currently being considered by Parliament in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill – will bring together the best of the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Competition Commission"&gt;CC&lt;/abbr&gt; into a single Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to become a world-leading competition authority, advocating competition both at home and abroad. It will have a greater role in ensuring competition in regulated sectors is being addressed, through enhanced cooperation and information sharing between itself and the sector regulators. It will make better use of public resources, and business will benefit from having a single agency to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-markets-and-mergers-regimes"&gt;The Markets and Mergers regimes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the CMA is set up, we shall maintain the separation of decision making between the two-phases of market and merger investigations [see page 94 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;]. Currently the two phases of an investigation are carried out by separate organisations: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 1, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/;jsessionid=8200B8DBE569E41858F3F97E2DFC0CAF"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can undertake an initial study into a merger or market to see if there is a competition issue to be addressed. If so, it can refer the case to:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/our-work"&gt;Competition Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Phase 2, which will carry out a deeper study to get to the nub of the problem and impose remedies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The separation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 decision-making on regulatory appeals will also be maintained and provided for in legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CMA will have powers, additionally, to conduct investigations into practices that impact on more than one market [see page 30 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;], such as extended warranties and other secondary point of sale practices, without the need to make multiple market investigation references. These powers will enable the CMA to take a more targeted approach to tackling recurring sources of consumer complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CMA will have discretion to stop a proposed merger [see page 42 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;] where there are concerns the merger may be anti-competitive, and to consider with the companies involved whether the merger should be allowed to proceed. Legislation will clarify that the Authority can reverse mergers that have already taken place where this is deemed appropriate after investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government also proposes to improve remedies by enabling the CMA to require parties to appoint an independent third party [see page 48 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;] to monitor, arbitrate, and/or implement remedies; and by giving the CMA the power to require parties to publish certain non-price information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="streamlining-and-strengthening-the-competition-tools"&gt;Streamlining and strengthening the competition tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minor change will give the Secretary of State the power to request the CMA to investigate public interest issues [see page 30of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;] alongside competition issues in a market investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure greater certainty and to reduce the burden to business, the Government proposes introducing or reducing statutory time limits at all stages of market investigations. This will be supported by information gathering powers at all stages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statutory time limits will also be introduced at all stages of the mergers process [see page 44of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="anti-trust-and-cartels"&gt;Anti-trust and cartels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system for enforcing the legal prohibitions in anti-trust (abuse of market dominance and other anti-competitive agreements) and cartel cases (eg agreement between companies to fix prices) contained in the Competition Act 1998 (‘antitrust’) is being strengthened. Proposals include statutory change to bolster separation between investigation and decision making and new powers for the CMA to improve the efficiency of investigations and transparency of the decision making process [see page 54of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/g/12-512-growth-and-competition-regime-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government’s response (PDF, 591 Kb)&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is work currently carried out by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;. Appeals against decisions by the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; (and the CMA once the reforms have been fully introduced) can be made to the Competition Appeal Tribunal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sectoral-regulation-and-concurrency"&gt;Sectoral Regulation and ‘concurrency’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sectoral regulators already have the power to refer cases to the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; but rarely use them. We want to encourage the CMA to be a more proactive central resource for these regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sectoral regulators have ‘concurrent competition powers’, ie: they have a choice between using their own sectoral powers and making use of the 1998 Competition Act to refer issues to the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;. We want to strengthen the primacy of the Competition Act by requiring sectoral regulators with concurrent powers to consider that route first; and also to give the CMA the power to take Competition Act cases from the sectoral regulators where it is better placed to proceed with the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="competition-complaints"&gt;Competition complaints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a company or group of companies are acting anti-competitively, then you may wish to consider making a complaint to the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; via its special hotline and email address for complaints under the Competition Act:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition Act Enquiry Line: 08457 22 44 99
Email enquiries: &lt;a href="mailto:enquiries.competitionact@oft.gov.uk"&gt;enquiries.competitionact@oft.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a detailed &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/advice_and_resources/resource_base/legal/competition-act-1998/complaints"&gt;how to complain section&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt; website. This gives examples of behaviour which may indicate that a company is breaching the Competition Act. It also gives information on what to do in order to complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Energy-intensive industries: compensation for carbon leakage </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="overview-of-the-compensation-scheme-for-energy-intensive-industries"&gt;Overview of the compensation scheme for energy-intensive industries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions are going to impact upon the bills faced by industrial consumers. This will have the greatest effect on those industries that use the most electricity, leading to a risk that investment in the UK is lost – carbon leakage. The government intends to compensate those businesses most at risk of carbon leakage, to help offset these increased costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his Autumn Statement on the 29 November 2011 the Chancellor announced that the government intends to implement measures to reduce the impact of policy on the costs of electricity for the most electricity-intensive industries, beginning in 2013 and worth around £250 million over the Spending Review period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this the government has committed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compensate key electricity-intensive businesses to help offset the indirect cost of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consult_carbon_price_support.htm"&gt;Carbon Price Floor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm"&gt;EU Emissions Trading System&lt;/a&gt;, subject to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/europe/state-aid"&gt;state aid guidelines&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increase the level of relief from the climate change levy on electricity for Climate Change Agreement participants from 65 to 90%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support this, in March 2012 BIS and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (&lt;abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change"&gt;DECC&lt;/abbr&gt;) launched Compensation for the indirect costs of the Carbon Price Floor and EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) - call for evidence. This asked companies and trade bodies to engage actively and share information and data on their electricity-intensity, in order to help government target compensation effectively. It closed on 4 May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, and separate to the call for evidence, the government has also committed to explore options for reducing the impact of electricity costs on electricity-intensive industries as a result of electricity market reform policies where this has a significant impact on their competitiveness, and subject to value for money and state aid considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2012 BIS and &lt;abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change"&gt;DECC&lt;/abbr&gt; launched a consultation on a proposal setting out the eligibility and design of the scheme to compensate energy intensive industries for the indirect costs of EU ETS and the Carbon Price Floor. See the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/energy-intensive-industries-compensation-scheme"&gt;Energy intensive industry compensation consultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="contact"&gt;Contact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a question about the package, or the call for evidence, or would like to register your interest please contact us: &lt;a href="mailto:energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="questions-and-answers"&gt;Questions and answers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-long-is-the-process-of-designing-the-compensation-scheme-going-to-take-before-a-firm-announcement-can-be-made"&gt;How long is the process of designing the compensation scheme going to take before a firm announcement can be made?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect to make an announcement in March 2013, although compensation may be made later than this. This is because any compensation to companies is subject to state aid considerations which can take up to two years. The government is engaging with the Commission early and regularly, aiming to shorten the state aid timescale as much as is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="when-will-this-package-be-delivered"&gt;When will this package be delivered?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s intention is that this package will start to be implemented in 2013, subject to state aid clearance. Eligibility for Indirect Compensation for indirect EU Emissions Trading System costs will be based on EU guidance, which was issued in May 2012. Compensation for indirect Carbon Price Floor costs is also state aid, and is therefore subject to Commission approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduced rate of the climate change levy, for those sectors who have signed Climate Change Agreements, from 35 to 10 per cent on electricity. This will only take effect from 1 April 2013, subject to legislation in the Finance Bill 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="does-the-package-remove-the-incentive-for-these-companies-to-become-more-energy-efficient-in-the-future"&gt;Does the package remove the incentive for these companies to become more energy efficient in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy will continue to be a major cost for energy intensive companies, incentivising them to become more efficient. These industries will continue to have a vital role to play in the UK economy. They need to adapt to lower carbon means of production where possible, but it is equally important that they remain competitive and that the UK remains an attractive location for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-effects-does-this-package-have-on-carbon-emissions"&gt;What effects does this package have on carbon emissions?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon emissions from electricity (power generation) are constrained by the EU ETS cap. This package will compensate for the increase in the indirect costs associated with the carbon price floor and the EU ETS, but will not affect the environmental integrity of the cap. Sectors who will receive an increased CCL rebate will be bound by the targets of their CCA agreements which encourage energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-about-electricity-market-reform-emr"&gt;What about Electricity Market Reform (&lt;abbr title="Electricity Market Reform"&gt;EMR&lt;/abbr&gt;)?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has also committed to explore options for reducing the impact of electricity costs on electricity-intensive industries as a result of electricity market reform policies, where this has a significant impact on their competitiveness. This is also subject to value for money and state aid consideration. For more information on &lt;abbr title="Electricity Market Reform"&gt;EMR&lt;/abbr&gt;, visit the &lt;abbr title="Electricity Market Reform"&gt;EMR&lt;/abbr&gt; page on the &lt;abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change"&gt;DECC&lt;/abbr&gt; web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="documentation"&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of documents and reports that enable a greater understanding of the role of energy intensive industries as we transition to a green economy and the impact that energy and climate change policy has on them. This page will be regularly updated with documentation relevant to energy intensive industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fiscal measures in support of energy intensive industries were announced at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/autumn_statement.pdf"&gt;Autumn Statement, November 2011&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="energy-intensive-industry-sub-group-of-the-green-economy-council"&gt;Energy Intensive Industry Sub-Group of the Green Economy Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Energy Intensive Industries Group was created by the Green Economy Council. Its original purpose was to bring together evidence on how Energy Intensive Industries are affected by energy and climate change policies and was tasked with coming forward with ideas for policy proposals. This led to the development of the Energy Intensive Industries package announced by the Chancellor in his 2011 autumn statement. Going forward the role of the group remains to support the work of the Council by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advising on issues for energy intensive industries around green and climate change policies, including, issues around competitiveness, business opportunities and challenges, so that the Government’s strategic approach properly reflects short, medium and long term needs of businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussing and, where appropriate, identifying action for energy intensive industries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acting as a mechanism for energy intensive industries to bring forward issues relating to the green economy which affect business, including views on what further Government policies are needed to ensure the development of the green economy and to facilitate green growth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting the development of the Energy Intensive Industries Package by informing the proposal for carbon price and EU Emissions Trading Scheme compensation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reporting at regular intervals to the Green Economy Council on the work of the group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="membership"&gt;Membership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Group has a membership drawn from Government and the Council. Current industry members of the sub-group are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="september-2012"&gt;11 September 2012&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members discussed the upcoming consultation on compensation for the indirect costs of EU ETS and the carbon price floor. Members heard that the state aid pre-notification for the compensation measures would be sent to the Commission by the end of September. There was an update on work on an exemption from the costs of &lt;abbr title="Electricity Market Reform"&gt;EMR&lt;/abbr&gt; feed-in-tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members discussed the possible implications of the proposal to simplify or scrap the Carbon Reduction Commitment (&lt;abbr title="Carbon Reduction Commitment"&gt;CRC&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an update on the progress of the upcoming energy efficiency strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="july-2012"&gt;3 July 2012&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members agreed the terms of reference and membership of the Energy Intensive Industry Sub-group of the Green Economy Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an update on the Green Investment Bank and members heard an update on the proposals for compensation for the indirect costs of the carbon price floor and EU ETS. Government will consult on the EII package in late summer. Members also heard an update on the process of providing and exemption from &lt;abbr title="Electricity Market Reform"&gt;EMR&lt;/abbr&gt; FITS for EIIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS outlined the timeframe for publishing the ‘An international comparison of energy and climate change policies impacting energy intensive industries in selected countries’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members discussed the ongoing Climate Change Agreement target negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TUC and EIUG presented their report on the value of EIIs to the UK supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="energy-intensive-industry-package--october-2012-consultation-update-consultation"&gt;Energy intensive industry package – October 2012 consultation update: consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a proposal setting out the eligibility and design of the scheme to compensate energy intensive industries for the indirect costs of EU ETS and the Carbon Price Floor. We are now consulting on these proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation document and response forms are available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/energy-intensive-industries-compensation-scheme"&gt;Energy intensive industries compensation scheme consultation page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will close on 21 December 2012, to allow ample time for interested parties to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please email &lt;a href="energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions about the energy intensive industry package or you would like to attend the discussion event in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
