    <title>Small businesses to benefit from £1.1 million innovation boost</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>New Innovation Vouchers for businesses who want to use public open data to develop new ideas, improve processes and target new markets.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation is vital for business growth. The aim is simple – to accelerate economic growth by stimulating and supporting business-led innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £2 million fund has been created for the Innovation Vouchers scheme, running over the next 3 years. The vouchers provide £5000 for a UK start-up, micro, small or medium-sized businesses to work with external experts and gain new knowledge to help their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £1.1 million announced today is for companies who want to use public open data to commercialise their ideas and develop products and prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open data business innovator or inventors could use an Innovation Voucher by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growing services and solutions using open data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing an idea into a working prototype&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;integrating open data with other data sources to develop products and prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;seeking intellectual property advice in respect of ideas incorporating open data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme is already open to businesses who want to develop ideas relating to the agri-food, built environment, space industries, energy, water and waste sectors, with a hundred vouchers allocated every 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures from round one show that over 200 projects were successful in the draw for Innovation Vouchers for agri-food, built environment and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This new wave of Innovation Vouchers will give SMEs a great opportunity to bid for funding that can make a real difference to the growth of their business ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They will be able to develop exciting proposals that can make use of open data, which have the potential to unlock great value and boost economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="innovation-vouchers"&gt;Innovation Vouchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will be able to apply for the Innovation Vouchers directly through the &lt;a rel="external" href="https://vouchers.innovateuk.org/"&gt;Technology Strategy Board&lt;/a&gt; and the Open Data Institute (ODI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business can use their Innovation Vouchers to work with knowledge suppliers such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;universities and further education colleges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;research and technology organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technical consultancies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;catapult centres&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;design advisers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;intellectual property advisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional funding for open data vouchers comes after BIS announced this week new measures &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-funding-to-accelerate-benefits-of-open-data-684c1.aspx"&gt;to open up access to public data&lt;/a&gt;, including a new £7.5 million Data Strategy Board Breakthrough Fund and a new £850,000 open data Immersion Programme which will assist public organisations and companies in opening up new opportunities for data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Support for Innovation Workshop</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A series of one day workshops about government support for business R&amp;D and innovation.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of one day workshops about government support for business &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; and innovation are being organised over the next few months for small and medium sized enterprises and their professional advisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Areas covered include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using the world-class level of &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; tax credit relief to invest more in your &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planning for the reduced (10%) rate of corporation tax on profits attributable to patents  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; grants available  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;networking with your peers in &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;utilising government procurement opportunities for your &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;maximising the value of intellectual property for competitive advantage  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using design to add value and help your business grow &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each session will be led by a representative from the relevant delivery body, and will allow ample time for Q&amp;amp;As. The day is supported by manned stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government hopes that one of the outcomes of the workshops will be to increase take-up of &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; tax credits by companies in sectors in which claims are low such as agri-food and also the energy and water industries. The government would also like to increase awareness that &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; tax credit claims can be made for design work where this involves &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshops are organized by the Department for Business Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (&lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vince Cable promotes UK advanced manufacturing</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>On 5 November Vince Cable officially opened MIRA Technology Park's new control centre. He also visited Toyota in Burnaston to celebrate the first new Auris model to roll off the production line.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;8 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="mira-technology-park"&gt;MIRA Technology Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIRA Technology Park (MTP) was granted &lt;a rel="external" href="http://enterprisezones.communities.gov.uk/"&gt;Enterprise Zone&lt;/a&gt; status by the government in August 2011. This has enabled MIRA to become Europe’s most advance independent transport technology facility. It is the first milestone in MIRA’s aim to become Europe’s most advance independent transport technology facility. Vince Cable opened the Technology Park’s new £6 million Control Centre, with the help of a MIRA unmanned vehicle to cut the ribbon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIRA provides state-of-the-art secure research facilities where high-tech companies can develop products that will make the world’s vehicles cleaner, smarter and safer. With companies like Bosch, Ashok Leyland, Triumph Motorcycles, Norgren and Lockheed Martin, the MTP cluster will help the UK to benefit from advanced automotive manufacturing, through deep rooted research and development.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was created the Technology Park has created 188 jobs, and a further 145 will be created in 2013. These are steps towards the goal of creating 2,000 jobs at MIRA over the next 10 years, and will contribute to the growth of advanced manufacturing in the Midlands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="funding-for-low-carbon-automotive-research-and-development-challenge"&gt;Funding for low carbon automotive research and development challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Secretary also announced £16.5m of funding for the next low carbon automotive research and development challenge from the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), the Office of Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). This will support R&amp;amp;D into four key areas: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal combustion engines &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;energy storage and management &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lightweight vehicle and powertrain structures, and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;electric machines and power electronics. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="toyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day at Toyota in Burnaston, Vince Cable witnessed the launch of production of the new Auris model - this time in all its hybrid, petrol and diesel guises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Secretary acknowledged Toyota’s critical part in the success story of the UK automotive manufacturing industry. Toyota has &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made the technology to reduce carbon dioxide from cars a mainstream proposition, as the first company to manufacture a volume hybrid vehicle in Europe &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;boosted UK automotive manufacturing by investing in Burnaston, including £185 million in Auris for its European markets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable met Toyota workers who were initially recruited as temporary contractors and were then offered production apprenticeships. Toyota now offers all new production workers a Level 2 apprenticeship. A high percentage have taken up this apprenticeship offer, with some going on to become direct Toyota employees. This supports the government’s aim to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Aug/holt-review-new-measures-to-improve-apprenticeships-for-smes"&gt;promote apprenticeships and make them more widely available&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="regional-growth-funding-for-derby"&gt;Regional Growth Funding for Derby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable also confirmed that Derby City Council will receive £40 million for its programme bid under Round 2 of the Regional Growth Fund (RGF), supporting growth and sustainable employment in the area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Programme will provide funds to support local business investment. This is expected to create around 3,000 new private sector jobs in the area in 2020, and develop local transport infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>£1 billion investment for UK Science and Research</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Seven new university and business research partnerships in sectors including life sciences, energy efficiency and advanced manufacturing were announced today by David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cash boost comes from the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (UK RPIF), which will deliver over £1 billion to support the development of new facilities and projects in areas including life sciences, energy and advanced manufacturing. The projects announced today are:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A £48 million partnership between Manchester University, Christie Hospital and Cancer Research UK to develop the Institute for Cancer Research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An £85 million partnership between UCL (University College London) and the Great Ormond Street Hospital for The Centre for Children’s Rare Disease Research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A £32 million partnership between Queen’s University Belfast, The Atlantic Philanthropies and a Wellcome-Wolfson Capital Award to deliver the next phase of the Institute of Health Sciences. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A £34 million partnership between the University of Nottingham and GlaxoSmithKline to support the Centre of Excellence in Sustainable Chemistry. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A £38 million partnership between Swansea University, British Petroleum (BP), and TATA Steel Europe for the development of the Energy Safety Research Institute. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A £60 million partnership between Brunel University, TWI and other companies to develop a National Research Centre for Structural Integrity. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A £150 million partnership between Imperial College London and Voreda to contribute to the development of a major new campus adjacent to the White City regeneration area.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This takes the  total number of projects supported by the fund to 14.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universities will shortly be able to bid for the remaining £80 million of public investment from the fund. This must be matched by at least double from private sources.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is fantastic that our top businesses and top charities are queuing up to collaborate with our world-class universities. They want to work together to deliver innovation, commercialisation and growth, which will help make sure the UK competes and thrives in the global race.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The winning projects will tackle the key issues we face - like fighting disease, ensuring energy efficiency and improving infrastructure - for the benefit of all.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK RPIF was first launched with £100 million of public finance in May 2012 and, in response to the large number of high-quality bids, the Government recently tripled the public support to £300 million. All projects have to include private funding from industry or the charitable sector worth a minimum of double the public contribution - making more than £1 billion of investment in total.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UKRPIF is managed and allocated by Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), working in collaboration with devolved counterparts.  All proposals are assessed by an independent assessment panel.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vince Cable delivers speech on UK science, openness and internationalisation</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Vince Cable explains why it's good for growth for scientists to operate in a range of countries.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second time I’ve had the opportunity as Secretary of State to talk about science to a distinguished scientific audience. The first time I spoke as a boring economist and argued that resources were finite, which earned me a sharp rebuke from Brian Cox the next day. But I think we reached a reasonable place on financial resources for science, given the budget difficulties facing the Government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I have a different proposition: that this country’s ongoing scientific prowess depends to an ever greater extent on openness: our ability to attract creative minds to these shores, the exchange of students, on our readiness to participate in research that’s conducted across borders, and on our commitment to public dialogue and access to data. This might seem obvious but there is always a powerful constituency arguing for closed minds and closed borders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, let me first to thank the Royal Society for arranging this stellar international gathering - along with the Royal Academy of Engineering, Academy of Medical Sciences and the British Academy; and for allowing a defector like me - who switched from natural sciences to economics as an undergraduate - to join you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also delighted to share this platform with Sir Paul Nurse; I agreed with the themes of his Dimbleby Lecture earlier this year, with its emphasis on science as a critical driver of the economy and its insistence on hard evidence informing decision making. I’m glad that we’ve managed to repatriate him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He, I’m sure, would be the first to acknowledge that international engagement and the dissemination of knowledge have defined the history of the Royal Society from its earliest days. Its very first secretary at the time of the Restoration, the Bremen-born natural philosopher Henry Oldenburg, reached out to contacts from across the known world. In the late 1670s, Edmond Halley journeyed to Danzig on behalf of the Society to settle a dispute between Robert Hooke and Johannes Hevelius - ruling, as it turned out, in the latter’s favour. In 1719, the Society appointed its first dedicated foreign secretary - a post it established before the British government, and one it has maintained ever since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any casual glance at the list of Society’s fellows or winners of the Copley Medal - and there’s considerable overlap - reveals foreign names widely familiar to non-scientists: Alessandro Volta, Louis Pasteur, Ivan Pavlov, Albert Einstein. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a cause for celebration on merely sentimental or nostalgic grounds. The Society’s leading position in world science - Britain’s too - has long depended on these intellectual associations. We have also gained enormously - including economically - from the likes of Max Perutz choosing to work here and founding the Laboratory of Molecular Biology. I hope, for example, that our most recent Nobel laureates, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, will create a similar legacy through their investigations into graphene at Manchester. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-mobility"&gt;Benefits of mobility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we have clear evidence that mobility is healthy for scientists. It’s always been possible, of course, to assert, say, that Dorothy Hodgkin’s extensive travels were an important aspect of her development as a scientist - but we can now go beyond the anecdotal. According to a report by Elsevier - and I mention this with my younger son, a physicist, currently based in Singapore - those of our researchers who spend more than two years working abroad before returning to the UK are the most productive. Think of mathematician Andrew Wiles, physicist Athene Donald and indeed Paul Nurse himself - all leaders in their respective fields, all beneficiaries of sojourns abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, UK researchers affiliated with an overseas institution are, on average, 75 per cent more productive than researchers without such a relationship - and I’m encouraged by the fact that the proportion of our scientists cultivating foreign contacts is far higher than in most other research-intensive nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most compelling advertisement for openness and collaboration right now is the Large Hadron Collider - the world’s largest ever scientific experiment and, currently, its biggest science story. As we digest the discovery of a boson with clear, Higgs-like characteristics, we should recall some of the reasons for British pride. We invested over £500 million in the Collider through direct funding and by supporting the 15 UK universities involved in its development. More than 600 UK scientists regularly work at CERN. Pupils from almost 250 UK schools visited CERN in 2011, and we’ve seen 2,000 more applicants for physics degrees in 2012/13 compared to the previous year. Let’s hope this is the shape of things to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are parallels here with economic trends. Britain is far more open to inward investment and trade than comparable developed countries, and we benefit as a result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamenting the so-called “brain drain” used to be a national sport. Nowadays, we should be actively encouraging “brain circulation”. It’s good for science - good for growth - when our researchers operate in a range of countries, building networks and identifying potential commercial applications linked to their work. On the flip side, it’s extremely good for the UK that we are an attractive place for transitory researchers - men and women who spend a couple of years here at most before returning home; they are often highly productive during their stay. Just under a third of active researchers in the UK fall in this category. Our performance in technology-related sectors and industries can only gain from such international collaboration and exchange - and we’ve reformed the visa system accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="immigration-policy"&gt;Immigration policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that the current immigration control system comes in for strong criticism in the academic and business communities. I accept that some of the signals sent from the UK have been damaging to the perception of how we welcome talent from overseas. But, In August 2011, we created a new category under Tier 1 for exceptional scientists, with four of the learned societies - including the Royal Academy of Engineering and our hosts tonight - endorsing applications. Such people need not secure a job offer before coming to the UK. We have also made adjustments to the skilled worker route, Tier 2, that recognises the situation facing scientists - by introducing an exemption on the salary threshold for those taking PhD-level jobs. This will make it easier for scientists and researchers to settle in the UK. We have also responded to concerns that recruitment rules do not reflect the highly specialised nature of research jobs - allowing employers to pick the best candidate for the job, even if there is a suitable resident worker, and allowing greater time to hire academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be world-beating, we need to be world-greeting. At last month’s Cheltenham Festival, I met a group of young scientists from several countries, who were all competing in the Fame Lab International Finals. They’d received a great reception from our science community - and it sent out a powerful message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still work to be done in communicating the new flexibilities on immigration to the outside world - especially Tier 1 - and my department wants to know of any outstanding issues, which it will endeavour to resolve. Nevertheless, we are making progress - simplifying, for instance, the process by which invited academics from overseas can lecture here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as international students are concerned, there is - contrary to widespread belief overseas - no cap on numbers. We welcome legitimate applicants to bona fide institutions and we want our education sector to take advantage of opportunities to grow. From everything I’ve said already, it should be clear that overseas talent is essential for a healthy research base, including via the undergraduate pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uk-attractiveness"&gt;UK Attractiveness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa procedures, of course, are just one factor in determining where scientists choose to locate - and we’re in no doubt about the increasing global competition to attract talent. More important is the working environment, which consists of many elements: levels of public investment in research, infrastructure and international programmes; opportunities to secure funding for research and make connections across disciplines; the standard of public debate on scientific issues and the extent to which a society adopts the scientific method. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a good story to tell, whether on protecting the national budget for science, establishing Catapult centres to advance next-generation technologies or creating bilateral research programmes with India, China and others. It’s heartening that people like Andre Geim have praised our system for awarding responsive mode grants as being competitive but fair. And it’s encouraging that other countries think highly of the UK’s approach to policy development and public engagement - as evidenced by Japan’s interest in the Chief Scientific Adviser model, following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, or the international praise for our public debate on the appropriate regulation of stem cell research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the reopening of the debate on GM and ongoing arguments around the appropriate mix of energy generation will be similarly objective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening, though, I want to focus briefly on three areas where David Willetts and I are currently seeking to improve the UK’s scientific environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defamation-bill"&gt;Defamation Bill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first concerns academic freedom. Freedom of speech and rational dialogue on controversial topics like climate change or genetically-modified foods are a must. The Defamation Bill, currently at Committee Stage in the Commons, contains specific measures to defend scientific and academic debate from the threat of unjustified libel proceedings. It will create a new defence of qualified privilege for peer-reviewed material in scientific and academic journals, and makes clear that qualified privilege extends to reports of scientific and academic conferences. It will raise the bar for claims under the test of serious harm, and introduce a single publication rule to prevent repeated claims against one publisher. The Bill also contains provisions to tackle libel tourism - one form of mobility of which we don’t approve - and offer greater protection to secondary publishers, such as booksellers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you will know, The British Chiropractic Association recently dropped its defamation case against Simon Singh, which lasted almost two years without ever coming to full trial and cost Singh more than £200,000. The Guardian incurred £500,000 in costs while successfully defending its journalist Ben Goldacre, who’d raised concerns about a South African vitamin manufacturer who denounced conventional AIDS treatments as ineffective. It’s important to ensure that free speech is not unjustifiably impeded by actual or threatened libel proceedings, while ensuring that people who have genuinely been defamed can protect their reputation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="data-access"&gt;Data access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two areas have received direct input from the Royal Society. We are in the middle of an information revolution. Where data used to be a by-product of research, it’s now a driver of research. Improving access to data will not only enhance transparency but fuel innovation, and we are just beginning to understand the potential of data mining to accelerate scientific breakthroughs and their translation into practical applications. Which is why the Government has affirmed the principle that publically-funded academic research is a public good produced in the national interest - and that, while intellectual property must be protected and commercial interests considered, it should be available with as few restrictions as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way we will more effectively disseminate knowledge, raise the prestige of UK research and encourage technology transfer. The Gateway to Research web portal, covering projects funded by the Research Councils, will launch next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome Janet Finch’s report on open access, to which the Government will respond in due course. I can assure this audience that the views of the learned societies will be taken into consideration as government policy evolves - not least the Royal Society’s contribution, “Science as an Open Enterprise”, published last month, which covered the opportunities and challenges of sharing scientific information. We certainly appreciate how different disciplines have different practices around data and IP. It is not our intention to formulate a one-size-fits-all approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it clear in my response to the Hargreaves Review, however, that outdated IP rules should not stand in the way of free flows of research. The Government will soon be publishing the second part of its response to the recent consultation on copyright, which included the proposal to establish a copyright exception for text and data mining in non-commercial research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Willetts, meanwhile, is chairing a new Research Transparency Sector Board, consisting of Government departments, funding agencies, and representatives from academia. One of its first tasks will be to consider how to act on the Royal Society’s recommendations - protecting the integrity of research while ensuring access to related businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stem-diversity"&gt;STEM diversity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and finally, I asked the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering - at the end of 2011 - to head up a four-year, government-funded programme to tackle the persistent issue of a lack of diversity in science, technology, engineering and maths. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way as it makes intellectual and economic sense to welcome able overseas researchers - regardless of their origins - recruiting our STEM workforce from the widest talent pool domestically is equally necessary. Not to do so means that talent is squandered. The Royal Society has recently commissioned work to explore socio-economic status within the science workforce - for which we presently have only minimal data - while, last month, the Royal Academy of Engineering launched the website of the STEM Disability Committee. I hope that this focused work can help to bring a broader range of people into science careers. Right now, women - for example - make up less than a fifth of all employees in the science sector. There’s no way we can generate the number of scientists and engineers the economy requires without addressing this situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to sum up. There’s a golden thread running through all of my remarks tonight, and that’s the way in which openness must continue to be a quality which sets UK science apart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However much we make science and engineering attainable careers for every young person in the country, we’ll always have to attract the best overseas talent - among undergraduates, PhD students, postdocs and experienced academics - by offering an environment in which they can fulfil their potential, pursue groundbreaking research or set up a science-based business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already invested scarce public money in the research base to preserve its broad disciplinary mix, and introduced reforms to make university finances sustainable. We can make a virtue of previous intellectual achievements and our traditions of transparency and collaboration, but it will only carry us so far. The challenge now is to demonstrate additional reasons why the UK is the place to come to embark upon a career in science or carry out blue-skies research; to start a tech-based company or take it to the next level; to tap into a highly efficient research base that’s steadily expanding its interface with business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear-headed and liberal attitude to immigration, freedom of expression and a willingness to be pioneers in new approaches to data sharing and mining should all be elements in that offer. And it’s an offer well worth making, because in scientific strength lies economic growth, democratic advancement and social wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Space - A new direction</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>David Willetts celebrates 50 years of the UK and the space industry and highlights the progress made since the launch of the Space Leadership Council.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning, everyone - and let me add a personal welcome to our distinguished guests today: Francesco Profumo, Enrico Saggesse, Vladimir Popovkin and of course Jean Jacques Dordain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be back at Farnborough as we celebrate 50 years of the UK in space. It was back in 1962 that the UKs first satellite, Ariel 1 was launched third after the USA and the then USSR. It was the start of a major home-grown industry and a true British success story. And I was delighted that, 50 years to the day, on April 26th 2012, the UK signed a £300 million contract to build the Solar Orbiter - a pioneering project to better understand how the Sun affects the Earth. It was the largest single contract placed by ESA with the UK space industry in two decades, and a great way to mark a half century of scientific and technological advancement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than surveying the past five decades, allow me to highlight some of the progress achieved in the UK since the formation of the UK Space Agency in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Agency has done a fine job carrying forward the Innovation and Growth Strategy agreed with industry through the Space Leadership Council. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satellite technology is now an integral part of the Government’s policy for broadband delivery in rural and hot spot areas. Public investment of around £40 million in satellite broadband technologies has leveraged more than £500 million of capital funds from the market to deliver UK-owned and UK-operated services. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The space cluster in Harwell, the ESA facility is up and running - and the joint ESA/UK business incubator has met its first-year target of establishing 10 new companies. There are in fact 12 firms now located there, with a further three about to join them. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further evidence of UK progress came only yesterday, with the announcement that leading US company Aerojet is to create a facility in Northern Ireland - and several dozen new jobs - to build rocket thrusters for satellites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the research side, we’ve had the first results from Cryosat that quantify the polar ice sheets - a major step towards understanding the rate of long-term change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve just delivered to NASA the first instrument for the James Webb Space Telescope - the giant successor to Hubble. And, thanks to UK expertise, we can look forward to the Planck satellite delivering a detailed map of the echoes of the Big Bang - showing the first structures in the Universe more than 13 billion years ago.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, perhaps, the space sector continues to buck general economic trends. Today, we are announcing the latest update on the size and health of the UK industry - and it’s very encouraging. The report shows that growth remains positive at an average of 7.5 per cent over the latest period surveyed - with downstream business doing particularly well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sector was worth £9.1billion in 2010/11 - compared to £7.5 billion in 2008/09 - and is providing jobs for 29,000 skilled workers. Space is one of the UK’s key high-tech growth industries. I fully expect this growth trajectory to continue, as UK industry breaks into new markets and seizes more export opportunities.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space-related technologies are advancing at a substantial pace - nowhere more so, arguably, than in launch systems. This is an area where the likes of Virgin Galactic and potentially the Skylon space plane being developed by Reaction Engines’s could be game changers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, it appears, is sticking with SpaceX’s traditional launcher model, while our Russian colleagues here continue to provide a valuable service through Soyuz. This presents an opportunity for us to seize the advantage in terms of both technology and regulation. Space tourism and commercial space are just beyond the horizon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at present, in my view, Europe is not ready to grab this opportunity - and we must not lose out. We must formulate a regulatory framework that will allow reusable aircraft-type launchers to operate here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that Reaction Engines are making a significant announcement this afternoon regarding progress on their pre-cooler technology. Their SABRE engine already represents 30 years of incredible British R&amp;amp;D. It’s a remarkable world first, and the pace at which they’re advancing illustrates the urgency of laying the appropriate groundwork now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why i can announce today that I will be working with Justine Greening at the Department for Transport, to determine how the UK, indeed the whole of Europe, can best position itself to take advantage of space plane activities. We’ll be exploring the type of certification needed for space crafts and identifying the essential characteristics of an operational spaceport. Antonio Tajani, European Competition Commissioner has also agreed to pursue this matter with the European Air Safety Agency.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where I’m keen to see further progress is at Harwell. Besides the positive news emerging from the business incubator, my department has funded the development of the International Space Innovation Centre, and last year’s £10 million investment in the National Space Technology Programme has brought in an extra £17 million from other sources. Some 50 new projects are underway as a result, from designing giant telecommunications satellites to testing “green” rocket propellants compliant with future safety requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m therefore delighted to announce today that the Satellite Applications Catapult will also be located at Harwell. The Catapult will give real impetus to commercial development from our space assets. Today we are also announcing the Technology Strategy Board delivery programme. From its £250 million budget for speeding up innovation in priority areas over the coming financial year, up to £10 million will be allocated to space.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger picture, of course, is making sure that space continues to be a key enabler of economic growth - and that’s the central goal of the revised Civil Space Strategy that I am publishing here today. The document, covering the next four years, focuses on creating new opportunities for industry, bolstering the role of space in the UK’s infrastructure and furthering the National Space Technology Programme. As such, it reflects the themes I’ve covered today, like regulating commercial space and improving knowledge of how the planet is changing, as well as addressing skills and training issues. It certainly captures the breadth of activity falling within the Space Agency’s remit.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to security matters, I recently met with colleagues in France and we agreed that space situational awareness - addressing the small but growing risk of satellites crashing into each other or colliding with other debris - is a growing issue. This is an area where we’ve tended to rely on the USA for information, but the UK does need to consider taking responsibility for managing its own issues. This is important in the context of our own satellites and those we share with European partners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent conclusion of the Wimbledon championships, I note that the smallest object we can currently track in low Earth orbit is equivalent to a spotting a tennis ball at a distance of 3,000 kilometres - making the undoubted powers of Hawkeye technology in SW19 seem rather humdrum by comparison. It’s vital that the UK has the capability to predict potential collisions with space debris or other satellites, and the Space Agency - together with other government departments - will be determining the scope of that capability in ways that are complementary to both our US and our European friends.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me conclude by looking forward to November, because 2012 is an important year for ESA, with the ministerial council taking place in Italy. The backdrop for the meeting is inevitably uncertain, given Europe’s current economic troubles. Nevertheless, as I await advice on the UK position from the Space Leadership Council, I hope we can reach a point that will see the role of ESA strengthened in this country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several important European-wide programmes which will require attention - not least the ESA missions to Mars in 2016 and 2018, for which our council hosts are also our major European partner. I am pleased that we now have a viable way ahead for Exomars, following NASA’s withdrawal from the project last year. I repeat my gratitude to the Russians for stepping into the breach - and to the other ESA member states currently rethinking priorities so that this mission can proceed. From a UK perspective, I’m looking forward to saying that our export drive - courtesy of Astrium - has extended to other parts of the solar system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only remains for me to hand you over to my co-chair on the UK’s Space Leadership Council, Andy Green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>England to be best in world for university business collaboration</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>David Willetts Minister for Universities and Science sets out plans to meet the challenge of making England the best place in the world for business-university collaboration.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the review of university-business collaboration by Professor Tim Wilson, David Willetts has announced new plans to strengthen that collaboration.  This will include improvements to the regime for sandwich courses, promotion of a new framework for business and universities to work together, and ensuring a better fit between graduates and jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s plans include:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting the Council for Industry and Higher Education (CIHE) to create a National Centre for Universities and Business. The centre will focus on strengthening the strategic partnership between universities and business with a view to driving economic growth and recovery. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stimulating student demand for sandwich courses by instituting a 15 per cent cap on fees for a sandwich year. This more reasonably reflects the costs of a sandwich place year and will encourage universities to invest in and expand sandwich course provision. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending the Graduate Talent Pool service for a further three years. This is a high-quality online resource that brings together graduates and businesses, and advertises internship vacancies, which now includes a strict quality assurance process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with graduate employers to promote fair recruitment and the use of new more detailed records of student achievement.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Public access to publicly-funded research</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very grateful for this opportunity to set out the Government’s approach to accessing and publishing research findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very fortunate to have such outstanding science and research capacity in this country. It is second in its range and volume only to the US. When it comes to the output generated from the funding that goes in, it is quite simply the most productive in the world. And no other country produces such a high proportion of work that is excellent. The recent review by Reed Elsevier, amongst others, provides the rigorous evidence behind these statements. With 1% of the world’s population and 4% of its researchers, we produce 6% of the world’s academic articles and 14% of those which are most highly cited. There are about 1.7 million academic articles published around the world, of which about 120,000 come from UK research. Thanks to the quality and success of our publishing industry, meanwhile, 400,000 of the world’s academic papers are published in the UK. If the rest of Britain performed like our research and publishing community, we would have rather fewer economic problems to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition is absolutely committed to sustaining this excellence. That is why we have protected cash spending for science and research. It is also why we have introduced higher fees and loans to be repaid by graduates, despite the intense controversy, to ensure our universities are well funded even as public spending is being cut back. Initiatives such as the life sciences strategy, the new Catapult centres, and the extra funding for high-performance computing are all aimed at strengthening our research capabilities in the face of intense international competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research base is one of our greatest economic assets. But it also enriches us in deeper ways. It enriches our cultural life to have such a range of intellectual activity here. We have an extraordinary window on the world: just about whatever happens anywhere, from a hostage taken in an obscure tribal area to a new scientific experiment, there is almost always someone in the UK who can help us understand it. This is an extraordinary privilege that we enjoy and which we should not take for granted. It contributes immeasurably to the quality of our national life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition set out its strategy on research and innovation last December. We understand that academic research is not a sausage machine where you simply put public money in one end and count the patents and the peer-reviewed articles that come out the other end. Instead we think of it as an ecosystem with subtle and intricate interdependences. It has many elements. Crucial is a spirit of free - and occasionally eccentric - intellectual enquiry. That in turn is sustained by our autonomous universities and our learned and professional societies. The ecosystem includes great charitable foundations like the Wellcome Trust. It is enriched by historic collections of data and objects organised with extraordinary skill and care. You, our world-class publishers of academic research, are another key part of this ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise the value which publishers add. Peer review is a crucial part of the research process. It takes various forms in which academics generously give their time to scrutinise draft articles. But value can also be added by identifying the academics to conduct peer review, through the editorial function of signalling which research is of the highest worth, and by helping others to find it. I do not scan the cacophony of opinion on the web to try to work out what is happening in the world: my laptop is set to open at the BBC news page. I do not follow wild and wacky online rumours. Instead I trust - well, usually - our leading newspapers and magazines to sort through the news for me. This process of winnowing data and research and then ranking them is of great value. Somehow it has to be paid for. But the way we pay for it is changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a student, you went to the library to take physical copies of journal articles down from the shelves. The best articles were in the best journals. The physical location of books meant they were already sorted and ranked. The canon was embodied in, and indeed protected by, the need for the physical organisation of stuff in libraries, and museums and galleries too. Nowadays, the canon is not so easily sustained by the act of organising material in physical space: this is a profound change which has wider effects on our culture and our politics, with which we are still grappling. You do not have a Dewey Decimal system on the web. Instead, as David Weinberger puts it, everything is miscellaneous. The more data and freely available comment, the more important it becomes to sort and shape that information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as reading some of the articles set by my tutors, I also remember browsing through the pages of the leading journals to see which articles were well-thumbed. It helped me to spot the key ones I ought to be familiar with - a primitive version of crowd-sourcing. The web should make that kind of search behaviour far easier. It offers a democratised version of the traditional canon. We are still at the early stages of harnessing the full power of the web to help us find and rate material. It is so frustrating to try to track something on the web, face 1.5 million results, and then give up after the first few. (Ironically, Google’s own search engine began as a device for measuring and tracking citations in academic journals; one reason why the ranking of results is still basically done by number of hits.) But researchers, just like the rest of us, spend too much time searching for material which they know must be out there on the web but can’t quite track down. Sir Tim Berners-Lee argues powerfully for the importance of developing a far more flexible semantic web. That is one of the challenges for our new Open Data Institute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to have far more research material freely available, and we need to be better at editing and sorting it. The challenge is to discharge both of these crucial functions better. This is the challenge facing your industry but you are not on your own. It is one that we share, since Government has responsibilities for intellectual property, copyright and, of course, funding much research. We can work on this in partnership. Let me now set out our approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our starting point is very simple. The Coalition is committed to the principle of public access to publicly-funded research results. That is where both technology and contemporary culture are taking us. It is how we can maximise the value and impact generated by our excellent research base. As taxpayers put their money towards intellectual enquiry, they cannot be barred from then accessing it. They should not be kept outside with their noses pressed to the window - whilst, inside, the academic community produces research in an exclusive space. The Government believes that published research material which has been publicly financed should be publicly accessible - and that principle goes well beyond the academic community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I might speak from the experience of writing my own book, The Pinch, on fairness between the generations. It was very frustrating to track down an article and then find it hidden behind a pay wall. That meant it was freely accessible to a professional in an academic institution, but not to me as an independent writer. That creates a barrier between the academic community and the rest of us, which is deeply unhealthy. I’ve heard of other anomalies: the lone researcher who enrols on an evening course he never attends in order to gain library access, since it’s cheaper than buying the articles he needs to read; the small business owner for whom one advantage of employing a sandwich-year student is because she can print off research papers through her university library. So there has to be a right to roam freely across the achievements of publicly-funded UK research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence underpinning our ambition for public access is compelling. For example, publicly funded and freely available information from the Human Genome Project led to greater take up of knowledge and commercialisation than from earlier protected data. To date, in fact, every dollar of federal investment in the Human Genome Project has helped generate $141 for the US economy. Separately, a report this year from the US Committee for Economic Development has concluded that the US National Institute of Health’s policy of open access after one year has accelerated scientific progress and the transition from basic research to commercialisation; generated more follow-on research and more citations; and reduced duplicate or dead-end lines of inquiry - so increasing the US government’s return on its investment in research. The researcher Philip Davis, meanwhile, has found that when publishers randomly made certain articles open access on journal websites, readership increased by up to 250% compared to protected articles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise this move to open access presents a challenge and opportunity for your industry, as you have historically received funding by charging for access to a publication. Nevertheless that funding model is surely going to have to change even beyond the positive transition to open access and hybrid journals that’s already underway. To try to preserve the old model is the wrong battle to fight. Look at how the music industry lost out by trying to criminalise a generation of young people for file sharing. It was companies outside the music business such as Spotify and Apple, with iTunes, that worked out a viable business model for access to music over the web. None of us want to see that fate overtake the publishing industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wider access is the way forward. I understand the publishing industry is currently considering offering free public access to scholarly journals at all UK public libraries. This is a very useful way of extending access: it would be good for our libraries too, and I welcome it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided we all recognise that open access is on its way, we can then work together to ensure that the valuable functions you carry out continue to be properly funded - and that the publishing industry remains a significant contributor to the UK economy. I believe that academic publishing does add value, not least because peer review is at the heart of our system of determining and communicating high-quality research. We do not yet have any reliable version of peer review on the net. The controversy about the status and reliability of reviews on Trip Advisor is a reminder of how precious genuinely objective peer review is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be deeply irresponsible to get rid of one business model and not put anything in its place. That is why I hosted a roundtable at BIS in March last year when all the key players discussed these issues. There was a genuine willingness to work together. As a result I commissioned Dame Janet Finch to chair an independent group of experts to investigate the issues and report back. We are grateful to the Publishers Association for playing a constructive role in her exercise, and we look forward to receiving her report in the next few weeks. No decisions will be taken until we have had the opportunity to consider it. But perhaps today I can share with you some provisional thoughts about where we are heading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial options are, as you know, called green and gold. Green means publishers are required to make research openly accessible within an agreed embargo period. This prompts a simple question: if an author’s manuscript is publicly available immediately, why should any library pay for a subscription to the version of record of any publisher’s journal? If you do not believe there is any added value in academic publishing you may view this with equanimity. But I believe that academic publishing does add value. So, in determining the embargo period, it’s necessary to strike a suitable balance between enabling revenue generation for publishers via subscriptions and providing public access to publicly funded information. In contrast, gold means that research funding includes the costs of immediate open publication, thereby allowing for full and immediate open access while still providing revenue to publishers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are versions of the green option - creating a single and very short standard embargo period for all publicly funded research - which may not work. There are, of course, differences between disciplines. In the arts and humanities, and to some extent the social sciences, the half-life of an article is longer than in, say, medicine. One of the key features of a science is that all previous knowledge is embodied in current theory, so older work may be honoured but does not have to be read. Literature, philosophy and historical writing are very different: it would be very peculiar to think you did not need to read Shakespeare or Kant or De Tocqueville. An article in the humanities or social sciences may be essential reading for much longer, so a green open access policy would have to take account of this difference. That is why our Research and Innovation Strategy referred to public access at “or around” the time of publication. This point was also addressed in the draft policy from RCUK - and we will reflect on it further in the light of Janet Finch’s findings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Wellcome Trust has been rightly praised for its decision to move to gold open access. As the Research Councils have proposed in their own draft policy, Wellcome are treating the costs of publication as an inherent part of the research process. This is the key feature of the gold option and again recognises the need to pay for publication and editorial functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we await Janet Finch’s advice, perhaps the most important question is how we get from here to there. We have to work out, with you, how to manage any transition, and it’s particularly tricky in an open international environment. The UK has many of the leading academic journals globally - of the world’s 23,000 peer-reviewed journals, 5,000 are published from the UK - but we do not have so many of the world’s academic libraries and research institutes. This means our journals are an important export industry, with perhaps 80% of their revenues coming from sales abroad. Let me put this crudely. At the moment, American and Chinese libraries have to pay for journals containing the results of our scientists’ research. In future we could be giving our research articles to the world for free via open access. But will we still have to pay for foreign journals and research carried out abroad? If so, would we not only have undermined a business model but an export industry too? And there could be collateral damage for our learned societies, a very important part of our research ecosystem, as many rely on journal subscriptions from abroad for part of their income. Those chauvinistic statistics with which I began this speech show that 94% of articles are published outside the UK, and we might still need to pay to access them while giving them ours. If so, there would be a clear shift in the balance of funding of research between countries. That is why, together with representatives of the academic community, I will be encouraging international action. Indeed, this is an area where if we can work together on an agreed approach we can then take a lead internationally and shape the debate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report therefore that representatives of the European Commission will be coming to BIS very soon to discuss open access. We share common objectives with the Commission and want to ensure that a sustainable strategy is developed for Europe as a whole. I will also be discussing the whole issue with colleagues beyond the EU. Fortunately there is already a lively debate on these issues in the US, and we hope they will be implementing similar initiatives. The US Committee on Economic Development, for example, advocates building on open access initiatives taken by the National Institute of Health, arguing that the costs involved are outweighed by the economic benefits derived from greater utilisation of research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another group we need to think about who do not conventionally have a place at the table. Earlier, I referred to my experience as someone outside the academic system trying to access academic research. The gold option would have helped researchers like me without a conventional academic post. But academics sometimes forget about a second type of outsider - someone who is conducting academic research without an official academic post but who legitimately expects to publish it in an academic journal. In future they will meet a new obstacle if they need to pay to be accepted in an academic journal. This is quite a significant issue in academic disciplines such as local history, where we have a rich literature generated by many highly skilled amateurs. I know some publishers already respond flexibly to this issue, for example through fee waivers for lone scholars, and I am keen to know if this might offer a sustainable way forwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to take account of the rapid technological change now underway. We are seeing an extraordinary surge in the sheer volume of data being released. It all goes back to Moore’s Law. It was originally a proposition about transistors - that their capacity would double every two years. But in its modern form, the law includes improvements in software too. In this form it says that computing capacity doubles every 18 months. And far from falling behind on this we appear, if anything, to be speeding up - with some estimates that capacity is now doubling roughly every 13 months. While processing speeds may have increased a thousand times, another estimate is that better algorithms have improved performance 43,000-fold. In his 2000 book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, Ray Kurzweil shows the power of Moore’s Law by applying it to the well-known story about the origins of chess. When the creator of chess demonstrated it to the king of Persia he was so impressed by the new game that he invited the inventor to name his reward. The man is supposed to have said he had a simple request: just one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the next square, four for the next, eight for the next and so on for all 64 squares, with each square having double the number of grains as the square before. The king readily agreed, and for the first part of the chessboard, it was fine. But by the time they had gone to the second half of the board the squares were going to require more grains of rice than were available in his entire kingdom. This is the power of compounding. We are now experiencing this with IT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts say that we are now reaching the second half of the chess board with enormous amounts of data now being generated - as with gene sequencing for example. The transformation of our capacity to handle very large amounts of data is going to have revolutionary effects. Some of the conventional distinctions between micro and macro analysis will erode as macro analysis starts emerging from very large volumes of micro data. I am persuaded by the argument that we are going to see a new era of data-intensive scientific discovery. And its implications spread way beyond academia to business. Instead of physically building prototypes, we can model them on computers. This is one reason why we invested a further £150 million in high performance computing. As they say, we must out-compute to compete. Our skills in software writing and computer simulation give us a real advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data mining is becoming an important part of scientific advance, with computer scientists working collaboratively with researchers and publishers to develop the necessary tools and technologies. With well over a million academic articles every year, researchers wanting to keep abreast of developments in their field are going to need analytic tools just to know where to start. There are proven benefits for humankind from text and data mining, such as the discovery of new treatments for Alzheimer’s. So we are considering how to advance UK capability in data mining in the light of the recommendations on intellectual property from Ian Hargreaves. Again we recognize that everyone adds some value here and we need to move forward in a way that shares the gains from text mining between everyone who contributes to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that publishers share an appreciation of the potential of these technologies, and that some of you are supporting developers in creating new applications. I would like to thank the publishers who have engaged with the Hargreaves process. The Government wants to see an environment which enables researchers to use datasets from a number of different publishers without undue costs or obstacles - and without undermining research publishing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally let me update you on how other Government agencies are approaching the challenges ahead. They too will wait for Janet Finch’s report - there will be no final decisions until then. Recently, RCUK set out some ideas in draft and caused some excitement around the world. Actually I take some encouragement from this as it shows we can lead the debate and do have the capacity to shape international discussions. Like all of us in Government the Research Councils recognise that we need academic publishing as part of the research process. To enable greater public access to Research Council-funded research information and simplify networking between researchers and SMEs, the Councils are now investing £2 million in the development of a UK “Gateway to Research” portal. Set to open next year, the gateway will enable users to establish who has received funding and for what research. It will provide direct links to actual research outputs such as data sets and publications. They are already working to ensure information is presented in a readily reusable form, using common formats and open standards. I am delighted that Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia will be advising us on these common standards and helping to make sure that the new government-funded portal for accessing research really promotes collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEFCE is also considering the issue. Peer review and assessment of impact are crucial to their allocation of research funding. The debate on open access will inform HEFCE’s planning for the research excellence process that succeeds the current one which concludes in 2014. Open access could be among the excellence criteria for qualifying articles in the future. We are developing a coherent strategy, with the decisions reached by the Research Councils and HEFCE meshing with the Hargreaves proposals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has given you some sense of the approach we have taken in Government. Delivering transparency and access while protecting legitimate business models is an important challenge, and we are tackling it. When we came to Government we immediately set up Hargreaves. We have accepted his report and are acting on it. Then we had the roundtable on open access after which I set up the Finch group. We explained our overall approach in the Research and Innovation Strategy. Government, the Research Councils and HEFCE have all been working towards a common policy, and we have tried to maintain an open dialogue with the publishing industry throughout. There is a lot going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we all are aware of the tricky issues around moving to open access, we must not lose sight of the big prize here. Open access is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. That end is improved popular involvement with the quite extraordinary output of our research community. I do not want to see science and humanities further removed from the so-called general reader. I was very struck by comments from Alice Bell of Imperial in the Times Higher that this could be a real opportunity to break down some of the barriers between academic professionals and the wider community. That is happening already with the surge of high quality popular science writing. I see it as well in the flourishing of science festivals and literary festivals. We welcome this. I hope that greater public access to research can be part of this very healthy trend in our culture. At the end of this we can hope to see science and research brought closer to the wider public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Massachusetts Innovation Economies Conference</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning. May I start by thanking Governor Patrick, and Media Lab’s director, Joi Ito for hosting today’s event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, MIT itself has a global reputation. It’s said that the combined revenues of all the companies started by MIT alumni are equal to the 11th largest economy in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s a real pleasure to be here at the MIT Media Lab, itself a renowned centre for innovation, which has been inventing the future since it opened its doors in 1985. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its outstanding track record of turning original, cutting-edge research into successful spin-outs, the MIT Media Lab is a potent symbol of the huge advances that are possible when academics, entrepreneurs and financiers collaborate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is truly the key to prosperity, and we in the UK have much to learn from our friends here in Massachusetts about the best way to encourage and nurture that innovation - whether of mind and hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uk-massachusetts-links"&gt;UK-Massachusetts links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I welcome the close links that exist between us and I am grateful, Governor Patrick, for the efforts you have made to strengthen those bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010 you worked with the legislature to amend a tax regime which would have disadvantaged British business and the trade mission you led to the UK last March has helped forge new business relationships, which will accelerate growth in our economies and benefit us all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since your visit, the British Consulate has brought a number of companies and investors over to the UK, including a group of Boston-area Venture Capitalists, to explore new investment opportunities in London, Cambridge, and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome this investment: more than 250 businesses from Massachusetts are already prospering in the UK and I will see many of these companies during my visit, including Akamai and EnerNOC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the UK is the second largest market in the world for Massachusetts exports; only Canada receives more. In fact, in 2011, 11.5% of this State’s exports - worth $3.2 billion - went to the UK. It’s a position we are keen to build on in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, this is not a one-way relationship. Many British firms are trading and investing in this state - major companies such as Shire Pharmaceuticals, RBS Citizens and the National Grid. In fact, I have learned on this trip that around 40,000 residents of Massachusetts go to work each day in UK firms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know one UK company looking to open up over here is in the room today. WEMS is an energy management company with a unique technology that helps businesses cut their consumption by as much as 30%. Sales are impressive - WEMS has doubled its turnover in 2011 from £6m to £12m. I applaud the company’s US expansion plans and I wish them success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="innovation"&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our long-established bilateral relationships give us strong foundations to build on. And collaboration will be crucial if we are to build an innovation economy, here in New England and back in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last three years, the global financial crisis, the recession and even the tsunami in Japan have shown how economic events reverberate around the globe. And as any technology business knows, national boundaries no longer shape our economic markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poses significant challenges - but it also opens up tremendous opportunities. And that’s a lesson that the UK, with our proud history of free trade and liberal markets, understands well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the current UK Government, led by our Prime Minister, David Cameron, has made it a priority to set out an unequivocal message to our international partners - Britain is open for business; open to innovators and entrepreneurs; open to investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around a third of Britain’s economic output is supported by inward investment. We also know that openness is a major driver of innovation, and research and development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes perfect sense, as these activities are increasingly international endeavours, in which both initial discoveries and end products emerge from different countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is in a strong position to play an active role in these international collaborations. We have a track record as innovators, developing everything from life-saving medicines to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three of Europe’s top five universities for technology - Imperial College, London; Oxford; and Cambridge, which, I believe, Governor, you visited as part of your trade mission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the most productive knowledge base in the G8, which produces 14% of the most highly cited papers and has expertise spanning over 400 separate areas of research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-support-for-innovation"&gt;Government support for innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a government we recognise that technological progress does not occur in a vacuum. That’s why, despite our substantial financial deficit, we have protected public investment in science and research. And we are setting up a national network of innovation centres, to bring together our best inventors and entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These centres are intended to overcome the old British weakness of failing to commercialise good ideas. Known as Catapult centres, they are specifically intended to propel bright ideas out of the lab and into the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all. We’re transforming the tax and regulatory environment to make it much easier for a company to start-up and grow in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means enabling entrepreneurs to register a new firm with the minimum of difficulty; cutting red tape so firms can more easily employ people; and cutting corporation tax, to one of the lowest rates in the entire G7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, just as you’ve introduced the ‘America Invents Act’, the UK government is modernising our copyright law and overhauling our patent system to make it simpler for new market entrants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tech-clusters"&gt;Tech Clusters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pro-business policies are underpinned by our belief that open markets and collaboration are the way ahead in modern research and technological development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding also lies behind the UK government’s support for efforts to grow the Tech City cluster in east London. And we are unashamedly learning as we go from successful US models - such as Silicon Valley, of course; MassChallenge; and the innovation community right here in Kendall Square. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech City has expanded dramatically over the past three years to become the fastest growing tech cluster in the world. In the past year alone, the number of firms has rocketed from 200 to more than 600. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it is home to companies like TweetDeck, which has revolutionised the way people manage their social media, and was snapped up by Twitter last year. Many household names are also locating in the area, such as Cisco, Vodafone, Google, Facebook and Intel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of businesses in Tech City is fostering a US-style eco-system able to support international technology entrepreneurs at every stage of the business life-cycle. It’s a fertile breeding ground for bright ideas that will also help attract investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other smaller-scale tech clusters are developing in other parts of the UK - Manchester, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Bristol to name just a few. But we want to nurture many more. That’s why we are doing all we can to spread the word that the UK is the perfect home for technology companies planning to break into new markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the message I would like to leave you with today. If you are looking for a new business or research partner - then look no further. The UK is the natural choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have highly skilled researchers and entrepreneurs; a working day spanning office hours in North America and Asia; and we speak the international language of business. The UK is the ideal gateway to Europe and a springboard to the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our shared commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship is another good reason for us to strengthen our historic friendship and forge new partnerships for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, together, we can create new jobs, business and prosperity for both our peoples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Science and the City</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s great to be here to celebrate the launch of WillPLACE. For me, it’s a welcome opportunity to recognise one of Britain’s great business success stories: insurance. It also provides a chance for me to carry forward the case for high-tech growth that I initially set out in a speech a couple of months ago.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today represents an exciting investment by Willis - an important broker in the insurance sector. The comments made by your CEO Joe Plumeri in a speech last month - about the role of the insurance industry in supporting commercial sustainability, its resilience through recent times and its reliance on knowledge and expertise - frame much of what I have to say this evening.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have in this country is a world-leading insurance sector. London is the only market in which all of the world’s 20 largest reinsurance groups are represented. Too often the City is regarded as shorthand for investment banking. Let’s be clear: the City covers far more than that. And we should be proud of competitive sectors like insurance. They matter for the economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK insurance sector is the third largest in the world - and the biggest in Europe, accounting for seven per cent of global premiums. Employing around 300,000 people in the UK - more than a quarter of all financial services jobs - it contributes some £10 billion in taxes. It’s also a major exporter, with about 30 per cent of its net premium income coming from overseas business. For the Government’s part, we remain committed to securing the best possible outcome for the UK insurance industry under Solvency II - on the timing of implementation and on the critical detail concerning equivalence and the matching premium.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a wider lesson here for financial services. Insurance has faced its own travails, but it has sorted itself out, reformed its practices and emerged stronger. The controversy surrounding some Lloyds underwriting syndicates was painful. I have constituents who are still living with the consequences of Equitable Life. But the City can learn from unhappy episodes like these, embrace reform and it can bounce back.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have and can celebrate a strong, vigorous insurance industry in the UK. There is also, and I am the minister responsible, a strong university and research sector in the UK - and there are connections between the two. For the rest of this speech, I want to investigate these connections - to shed light on the real nature and significance of high-tech growth, and how best to support it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most obvious function for higher and further education is to produce graduates that business can recruit - and, in your industry, of course, there is a clear need for graduates with maths skills. The good news is at school level, uptake of STEM subjects - that’s science, technology, engineering and maths - at GCSE and A level has been rising steadily over the past few years. We’ve seen a 42 per cent increase among UK-based students taking a first degree in maths over the past 10 years - and an 18 per cent increase among maths PhD entrants. In the Autumn statement, we announced that we’d support a scheme to enable the kite-marking of STEM-related courses which are valued by employers. But the educational role is only one aspect of the relationship. The associations are both broader and deeper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="windows-upon-the-world"&gt;Windows upon the world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links between the UK’s outstanding science and research base and what you do go even further than education. They go right back to the open character of our society. We insure and reinsure the world’s risks right here. Brokers like Willis connect the world’s risks and the world’s insurance capacity. You are, in effect, a window upon the world. This has always has been a global business, as our merchants have sought to insure their cargoes moving across the oceans - originally in the coffee houses of the Square Mile. No doubt they do so again today, thanks to Starbucks and wifi. It’s a clear case of history repeating itself, but also a classic example of Britain’s reach - and not just in a purely international sense. Nowadays, we insure commercial activities ranging from the deep sea to earth orbit.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK science and research is another international window on the world. Like your business, it is bound up with our history of exploration and discovery. It’s what lies behind our understanding of the cultures and languages of other countries. For anywhere in the world, we’re likely to have linguists, anthropologists, historians, sociologists studying it today. There are not many nations who can claim that breadth of expertise. We should be proud of it and we are certainly sustaining it. This breadth resides not just in the humanities and social sciences. According to last year’s report written by Elsevier, the UK can boast internationally-recognised research strength in more than 400 fields. That includes strengths in studying the physical and the natural world - biology, geology, geography, hydrography and all those disciplines which joined the Royal Navy and merchant fleet on their circumnavigations. Think of those great expeditions in which the Royal Navy and the scientists of the day co-operated, from the Beagle to Scott’s journeys to the Antarctic, which we are commemorating this year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our scientists still fan out across the world and study data collected from above and below it, to understand how our planet works. In February, I visited British Antarctic Survey researchers on the west of the Antarctic peninsula. The people stationed there are conducting a range of experiments including examining molluscs collected during Captain Scott’s expedition with the same species collected by current researchers from the very same location to understand the effects of climate change over time. Very few countries are in a position to carry out this kind of comparative work because they don’t have our history of exploration and scientific investigation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the insurance industry has a window on the world. Scientists do too - and their activities are intrinsic to what you do. In fact, scientists and insurers must gaze through the same pane of glass. Their raison d’etre is understanding nature and you also need to understand nature as the prerequisite to judging risk. You share, therefore, the same need to understand our world.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earth observation exemplifies that shared mission - and for me, its true importance hit home when I visited JPL in Pasadena, where a large screen simultaneously shows missions is monitoring the oceans, polar ice, atmospheric pollution and forest fires. It treats the world like a human patient. No one country can take responsibility for all this work, but the UK plays a leading role. Last year we chaired the international committee that covers space and major disasters; UK satellites provide vital data in the wake of major natural disasters. Last week, in fact, we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Envisat satellite - 10 years of UK-built technology providing scientists and researchers with quality data to analyse global warming and climate change.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason I am so keen to support our space sector is that I see our role as a space-faring nation as a natural follow-on from our role as a sea faring nation. Again, it gives us global reach and understanding. Inmarsat, the world leading maritime communications business is based just a few hundred meters from here, and we’re doing our best to make sure that the business infrastructure is in place to grow the FTSE 100 space companies of tomorrow. That includes changing the Outer Space Act by introducing an upper limit on liability for UK operators, developing the right insurance infrastructure for space activities and investing to open up new markets.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s another aspect of Government investment in space of particular interest to the insurance industry. In November, we committed £21 million to assist in the development and launch of the UK’s first Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite - better known as NovaSAR. Once NovaSAR is up and running, businesses will be able to use the data in various ways, including maritime surveillance of drug-trafficking, oil spills and piracy. With piracy, the major advantage of NovaSAR is that it has the ability to image at day or night and effectively see through clouds. NovaSAR can also cover vast areas, like the Indian Ocean, in relatively short periods of time - with sufficient resolution to detect small individual ships, their speed and direction. By marrying this information with automatic broadcast messages which identify individual ships, NovaSAR will enable law enforcement agencies to identify and target uncooperative or suspect vessels.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are investing in other branches of science to help all of us understand the world - and help you to insure it. The Met Office Hadley Centre is probably the world’s leading place for combining weather and climate forecasting. In the past, the Met Office has sat with the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Defence, given its importance in protecting commercial shipping and our armed forces. Last year, it moved over to BIS and is part of the science family for which we have responsibility. We have excellent centres of meteorology such as the University of Reading, where I was recently - and where I know that Willis has funded a chair in Climate System Science and Climate Hazards. Meanwhile, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is leading the £2.8million PURE programme on probability, uncertainty and risk in the Environment - improving assessment and quantification in natural hazards by developing new methods and demonstrating their applicability. We will announce the winning bids for PURE next month.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Met Office is continuing to combine its expertise in weather and climate with the UK’s researchers in environmental science. It has already brought together several institutions and agencies to form the Natural Hazards Partnership, which provides round-the-clock support to the emergency response services. Now it is extending this concept through the Environmental Science to Service Partnership, which aims to harness the nation’s investment in environmental science for the benefit of society, business and government. At the same time, the UK Space Agency is opening up data for researchers and companies at the centre for Climate and Environment Monitoring from Space (CEMS). Based at the International Space Innovation Centre in Harwell so we want CEMS to become the leader in satellite data integration and information delivery.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You at Willis appreciate the full significance of such connections - and have been at the forefront of engaging with our research base. Besides Reading University, you have established links with scientists through the Willis Research network, including experts at Exeter, Swansea, Durham, Cambridge and Imperial. And here, I’d like to pause for a moment to thank Rowan Douglas, head of Willis Re Analytics, for his passionate and articulate support for British science as a member of the NERC Council and as an adviser to the Prime Minister on the Council for Science and Technology. Rowan is a leader in recognising the current value and future potential of British science and how much more the UK stands to benefit from it providing we make the right connections. This is one of many reasons why we were entirely right to offer cash protection to the science budget - and to find extra resource for capital expenditure. Part of the £145 million allocated to e-infrastructure, for example, will support the supercomputing project MONSooN based at Exeter, which is focused entirely on weather and climate research.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willis is not alone in reaching out to the research base. Southampton University has created a marine and maritime institute on the back of its close relationship with Lloyds Register, which will co-locate to the University’s Boldrewood campus. The investment of around £120 million in the campus is the largest business-focused endeavour in any UK university, and will make the institute a centre for inter-disciplinary research of huge benefit to the maritime sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-world-in-flux"&gt;A world in flux&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the physical world is all the more necessary because of the speed at which the natural environment is altering. Natural disasters caused £100 billion of damage in 2011. It was the costliest year in the insurance market’s 323-year history. Scientists and insurers are both urgently scrutinising a world in flux.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iceland volcano; flash floods in Pakistan; the earthquake in Haiti; wildfires in Russia: scientists recorded 960 loss-relevant events in 2010, a world record. More than ever, insurers are reliant on Earth observation data for exposure control, damage assessment and then loss quantification. When a catastrophe happens, your industry is only a few steps behind the emergency responders.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were fewer than 400 natural catastrophes in 1980, compared to almost 1,000 in 2010 - with a significant rise in meteorological and hydrological events, and a measurable increase in climatological ones.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the climate changes, so we expect more energy in the climate system to lead to more extreme weather events. But, of course, while we can make this general point on a probabilistic basis, individual events cannot necessarily be attributed to climate change. The past may be no guide to the future - hence the enormous value of scientific modelling to a world where there is more of value to destroy - more buildings, ships and wealth than ever before. That trend line is crucial to your business.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More of these natural events are insured here in the London market than anywhere else - meaning record pay outs. But has there been a crisis in London insurance market? No. There have been quite a few stories about financial services in recent years, some of them pretty dreadful, but they haven’t focused on the London insurance market. One reason for that is your continuous engagement with our scientific community to make sure you have the best possible understanding of the world around us.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week is Climate Week - a campaign of awareness raising and public engagement. Let me be clear about the view we in the coalition take on climate change. As a coalition, we are informed by the available scientific evidence: evidence from temperature records in England dating back to 1659 and proxy measurements from ice cores going back thousands of years - which I observed in the Antarctic last month; evidence from the sophisticated models designed by NASA and our own Met Office, projecting future climate under a range of emissions scenarios. The evidence is overwhelming, validated by the vast majority of scientists, and points in one direction. The earth’s surface has warmed by more than 0.75 degrees centigrade since around 1900, with much of this warming occurring in the past 50 years.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Assessment Report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 concluded that - with a probability of more than 90 per cent - most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century is attributable to the observed increase in human-caused greenhouse gas concentrations. We are currently annually emitting more than 30 billion tonnes of CO2 globally by burning fossil fuels. Putting all this together, average global temperatures may rise between 1.1°C and 6.4°C above 1990 levels by the end of this century.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are many uncertainties involved here - discontinuities or tipping points, for example, and the scientific community is focussing huge efforts on examining these. But as science minister I operate purely from the available evidence.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason why climate change is so important is the potential burden our generation may bequeath. When Margaret Thatcher opened the Hadley Centre in May 1990, she observed that “Man’s activities are already adding greenhouse gases to the Earth at an unprecedented rate, with inevitable consequences for our future climate” - and that “The problems do not lie in the future–they are here and now–and it is our children and grandchildren, who are already growing up, who will be affected.” This relates to the central theme of my book, The Pinch - fairness between generations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a DEFRA climate change risk assessment published in January, for example, annual damage to properties in England and Wales from river and sea flooding is projected to rise to between £2 billion and £12 billion annually by the 2080s - against a current cost of around £1.3 billion. While premature deaths due to cold winters are projected to decrease significantly, premature deaths due to hotter summers are likely to increase - by up to around 4,000 by the 2050s. From a scientific perspective, uncertainties around tipping points, and the potentially incalculable costs that these could impose on our descendents, are rather big bets to place on the future when there are sound arguments - and good business opportunities - for moving towards a low carbon economy now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-modelled-world"&gt;The modelled world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, I’ve illustrated the significance of the links between the work of our scientists studying climate change and the natural world, and your work in insurance. But that’s not the end of the story, for there is another connection besides. It’s not only what we research that matters, but how we do it. The sheer volume of data is currently one of the biggest challenges facing science. Analysing all that data for scientific discovery is one of our great challenges.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the classic ways in which we handle these large volumes of data is through algorithms. And this year, in June, we are marking the centenary of the birth of the great British scientist who, more than anyone else, linked the maths of algorithms to modern computing: Alan Turing. Handling large datasets is a key skill in financial services, in advanced manufacturing, and in scientific research too. That is why we are investing £165 million in e-infrastructure. Tomorrow, I will be co-chairing, with Professor Dominic Tildesley, the first meeting of the e-infrastructure leadership council that is going to ensure the UK maintains its global lead in this discipline.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computational modelling, as I’ve already suggested, is well developed for predicting the natural world, but there is huge potential in combining high performance computing and analytics to improve existing models: the better the model, the better the business decision. As Rowan Douglas has convincingly argued, this can - indeed must - be a virtuous circle. The UK has great strengths in modelling and simulation software, but we also need the mathematics knowhow to exploit future architectures, combine methodologies in solving complex problems and handle the associated storage and data analysis issues.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent international review rated the UK as excellent in the mathematical sciences, with world-leading researchers in every subfield. I know that some of our mathematicians are worried that the importance of maths research is being overlooked. I take their concern very seriously - and so does the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. In response to the review’s recommendations, the EPSRC published an action plan in November 2011. In fact, the EPSRC tell me that they will be increasing the total amount of resources going into maths through their wider work on societal challenges over the period covered by the spending review.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far as the City is concerned, we have pledged support for a doctoral training centre in financial computing at University College, London. The £20 million centre - for £7.5 million from the Research Councils leveraged the remaining investment - has a particular interest in algorithmic risk simulation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where WillPLACE fits in - presumably hoping clients will place their business with Willis. Through a market match algorithm, it can harness new technology to deliver a modern version of the classic broker function. The customer wins thanks to better information about the market, which drives competition. Business wins thanks to better access to more customers. The UK wins by Willis - and companies like you - being at the forefront of innovation and also based here.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a range of major UK firms and sectors are essentially in the algorithm business. Autonomy is one, of course, but they aren’t alone. WPP may be thought of as a services company, and its R&amp;amp;D budget is officially small, but sophisticated sentiment analysis is crucial to its business. And what about Tesco, who rely on club cards and algorithms to achieve smart customer segmentation and targeting? Algorithms seek out and discover new relationships and business opportunities that would otherwise be invisible and unexploited.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying we will have the world’s biggest fastest computers, though we do need to be there or thereabouts. Our comparative advantage is different. It is the skill to programme those computers to maximise their capabilities, and employ those capabilities to great effect in business. It is also to develop new market opportunities in, for example, low energy use computing. I recently opened the world’s most energy efficient high performance computer in Edinburgh. BlueGene/Q can carry something like 800 million million calculations a second, yet requires only the electricity needed to run a light bulb.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have seen several connections between what you do and the UK’s scientific activities. UK insurance and UK science share a need to understand the world around us and to understand how it is changing. We’ve seen how both rely on sophisticated maths-based models. Let me finally take a step back and connect all this to my wider argument about the Government’s growth strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="defining-and-supporting-high-tech-industry"&gt;Defining and supporting high-tech industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago I set out the Coalition’s commitment to high-tech growth - not just as a nice idea but as something we should actively pursue through the right mix of policies backing science, research and innovation. One challenge to my speech was that high tech may sound sexy but it just isn’t big enough to matter today; in the future, perhaps, but not now.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that official statistics record high-tech businesses as a small part of our GDP. The OECD definition of a high-tech industry is one with a R&amp;amp;D-to-output ratio of more than 4 per cent. By this measure, high tech does indeed look small in the UK. Indeed, measured in this way, high tech invariably comprises a small part of any advanced economy. But we need to look behind that definition, because it’s a bad guide to policy. It completely fails to account for the way in which scientific knowledge flows into industries. Many low-tech activities, such as timber products or warehousing, have important scientific inputs. Therefore, general purpose technologies permeate the economy - with an impact extending way beyond so-called high-tech sectors.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the OECD definition, insurance is not officially a high-tech industry. Even though it’s classed as “knowledge intensive” - with more than one third of its workforce qualified to degree level - insurance is considered to do little by way of R&amp;amp;D. I very much doubt that any insurance company spends anything like four per cent of its turnover on R&amp;amp;D.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I have shown this evening, you actually depend to a considerable degree on high-tech science and research. Your excellent global performance depends in part on access to world-class science which does not show up in figures measuring your activity.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So high tech matters far more than official figures suggest, and that challenge to my January speech - that high tech remains relatively unimportant - is misguided. Even apparently low-tech industries may depend on high-tech investment and research. Currently, we have high-tech industries flying under the radar and - once we recognise them - it becomes clear how crucially important high-tech capability really is.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why our high-tech strategy is so central - why our investment in general purpose technologies like high-performance computing and our commitment to scientific research are so necessary to rebalancing the UK economy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is my central message this evening. High tech is crucial to rebalancing the economy. Often, even low tech is high tech. On that basis, I congratulate you on the development and delivery of WillPLACE - and wish you every success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Government and industry launch a new project to ensure UK is well positioned for the future rollout of cleaner cars.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Mark Prisk has launched a new ground-breaking programme, UKH2Mobility, to position the UK for the commercial rollout of Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UKH2Mobility is a partnership of Government and industry. A broad mix of industrial sectors is involved, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utility. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gas. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infrastructure. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Global car manufacturing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will work together to share learning on how hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles could be a commercial alternative to traditional forms of transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is investing £400 million to support the development, demonstration and deployment of these vehicles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the launch, Mark Prisk said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This country has a number of world-class companies that are developing exciting technologies in both the hydrogen energy and automotive value chains and it is vitally important that we identify what is required to make these cars a realistic proposition for UK consumers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“UKH2Mobility will bring together industry expertise to establish the UK as a serious global player in the manufacture and use of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and the supporting infrastructure.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UKH2Mobility will deliver its report by the end of the year. If the results are positive, an action plan will be developed to get the UK ready to be one of the first markets to take full commercial advantage of Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our high tech future</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>David Willetts has today set out an ambition to make Britain the best place in the world to do science.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech at Policy Exchange, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts argued that that our greatest national assets - our universities, our science facilities and researchers - are the best single hope for making our way in the high-tech world of the future, creating jobs and opportunities and boosting high tech economic growth. &lt;br&gt;
David Willetts said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If properly nurtured they can ensure that Britain will be up there as a leading location for research in the physical and life sciences and beyond. Britain can be the preferred location for companies’ R&amp;amp;D. We can have world-class industries using cutting-edge technologies. We can have a prosperous future with a role in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He set out a plan to help Britain become the best place in the world for science and research and announced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An invitation for proposals for a new type of university with a focus on science and technology and on postgraduates. There will be no additional Government funding. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The creation of a new Catapult centre in satellite applications, providing businesses with access to orbit test facilities, to develop and demonstrate new technologies. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting up Leadership Councils in E-Infrastructure and in Synthetic Biology bringing together key players to drive forward private investment and innovation. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An ambition for universities funding from external sources to grow by 10% over the next three years. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aim to get more universities into the top 100 in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also released reports on the impact of research sponsored by the Research Councils and the Government’s e-infrastructure strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our Hi-Tech Future</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="economic-growth"&gt;Economic Growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth is the Coalition’s highest priority for 2012. It is going to be a year of serious economic challenges. We are better prepared for them than most because we took tough decisions on the deficit early on. We have set out our plans for getting a grip on public spending and we are sticking to them. That will enable us to bring down the enormous deficit we inherited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting out the mess in the public finances itself helps get the economy moving as it helps to keep interest rates low. But that is not the whole story. There are a host of ways in which the Government is supporting growth by raising the performance of the economy: cutting red tape, a tax and benefit system that rewards work, high quality education and skills, reforming the planning regime so that our new infrastructure can be built expeditiously. George Osborne and Vince Cable are driving forward such an agenda across Whitehall in the Growth review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That list of our growth policies applies horizontally across most sectors of the economy. Investing in energy or transport or better schools is a good thing without taking any view about whether the future of our economy is manufacturing or life sciences or financial services. There is widespread wariness of so-called “vertical” policies that focus on particular sectors and technologies and it is very understandable. The more specific the return, the greater the chance that it can be financed privately. Moreover, we fear governments do not have the knowledge to back particular technologies and have made a mess of such policies in the past. Governments picking winners can easily become losers picking Government programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent British Governments have therefore preferred generic growth policies rather than vertical ones which focus on particular sectors or technologies. These are essential foundations but it only takes you so far and today I want to show how much further the Coalition is going and why. Soon you find that you are having to take some kind of view about specific sectors and technologies too. Which source of energy do you encourage? When it comes to transport which places do you link up and why? The Jubilee line extension has been great for London but I well remember how its original impetus in the 1980s came from the need to provide access to Canary Wharf: if it had been a link to a manufacturing centre not office blocks for financial services it might have been seen as a much more controversial example of industrial policy. We have achieved an extraordinary surge in apprenticeships but I am struck by how many commentators believe they should be in particular sectors such as engineering or life sciences: indeed part of the appeal of apprenticeships is their historic association with such sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments find themselves making decisions about allocation of resources and we should not pretend we do not. The Coalition’s pledge to rebalance the economy depends on taking such a view. Indeed when money is tight these type of decisions are even more acute. And in the rest of this speech I want to set out how we do this in our strategy for the UK’s science and research base and how it can help generate high tech growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do of course ask: “So where is the growth going to come from?” Nobody can know for certain. But that does not mean that we do not have the faintest idea. A lot of it will come from our established, high performing sectors which continue to innovate and improve productivity. We can discern already some of the scientific discoveries and technologies that will shape our future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I want to set out what we are doing to secure this future for us and I am grateful to Policy Exchange and the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE) for the opportunity to do so. This tackles that deep-seated anxiety about the prospects for the younger generation in the global economy of the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you ask people what worries them most it is that their children will not have the same kind of opportunities in life as we have had. I understand that fear - indeed I wrote a book about it. But our great national assets - our universities, our science facilities and researchers, our extraordinary accomplishments in the arts and humanities - are the best single hope for making our way in the high-tech world of the future. They might not solve all our economic problems next year, though they can help even with this. But if properly nurtured they can ensure that Britain will be up there as a leading location for research in the physical and life sciences and beyond. Britain can be the preferred location for companies’ R&amp;amp;D. We can have world-class industries using cutting edge technologies. We can have a prosperous future with a role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="our-research-base"&gt;Our research base&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research community is the most productive in the world. In the words of the recent Elsevier report, “The UK is the clear leader among all eight comparator countries (Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, US) on citations per unit spend on Gross Expenditure on Research &amp;amp; Development.” With 3% of the world’s researchers, we generate 6% of the world’s academic articles, 11% of citations, and 14% of the most cited papers, second only to the US. Quite simply we have more articles per researcher, more citations per researcher and more usage per article than researchers in US, China, Japan and Germany. We can be proud of this achievement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very broadly based too. The Elsevier report states: “ Relative to the world average, the UK has generally a well rounded portfolio, with a strong and increasing emphasis in clinical sciences, health &amp;amp; medical sciences, social sciences, business and humanities.” They identify no fewer than 400 research areas where we have a distinctive research strength, and many of them are world-class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite extraordinary for an economy of our size to have strength in so many different areas. No other country of our size has achieved this. It is particularly important as so much research is increasingly interdisciplinary. Our goal is nothing less than to ensure we have a continuing presence in the key areas of scientific research. We should not have the illusion that we can lead in all the scientific and technical advances of the future. But such chauvinism is unnecessary. What we can aim to have is the absorptive capacity to understand and draw on scientific and technological advances across disciplines and across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This broad research base emphatically includes the arts, humanities and social sciences. They are all part of the science and research ring fence. Increasingly for example research in the physical sciences is linked to human behaviour - not just designing a low carbon vehicle but understanding what makes people choose to drive it - or not. In allocating research funding I have therefore followed the advice of the learned societies and others that we should not shift the balance of funding between the main disciplines. Eric Schmidt of Google caught the mood in his MacTaggart lecture when he said that this arts v sciences debate really ought to be dead and buried and instead we should recognise how complementary they are. I like the idea that instead of just thinking about STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths, we should add the Arts so it becomes STEAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason our research is so good is that ministers have so little scope to interfere. Our science and research programme budget of £4.6 billion is not just protected in cash terms, it is also protected by the Haldane principle that Ministers do not decide on funding for particular research projects or particular university departments. It also rests on the gold standard of peer review. We are talking here about free enquiry where you are judged by your peers not by the minister for science nor the government as a whole nor by academic patronage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last protection is underestimated. We do not have a baronial system in which ageing professors dispense posts and patronage and younger academics have to defer to them for decades as they patiently wait their turn. One reason why so many young researchers from across Europe choose to work in the UK is that opportunities for them are much greater here. We will continue to support and monitor the compact on conditions for young researchers, especially women for whom the requirement to be mobile around the country with little allowance for family responsibilities can be particularly onerous. I welcome the latest initiative by HEFCE to make better allowance for maternity leave in assessing researchers’ output for the Research Excellence Framework.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must continue to sustain our research base in tough times. If you look at the decisions the Coalition has already made you can see how committed we are to science and research. In fact I can confirm the Government’s aim is quite simple if very ambitious: it is that we should be the best place in the world to do science. This ambition is about more than money. It is about respect and celebration of the spirit of scientific enquiry with everything from world-leading science journals and lively science writing to world class museums and events. It is something Government has to practise too with science advisers in every department, the Foresight horizon-scanning enquiries of the Government Office for Science and evidence-based policy drawing on latest advances in science such as behavioural economics. It also means: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tackling the pernicious effects on scientific enquiry of the current law on libel.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to keep our country open to leading scientists who wish to work here and making a big contribution to global science projects such as managing the Square Kilometre Array and the key role of our scientists in CERN and in the JET and ITER projects for nuclear fusion.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An ever wider interest in science with growing attendance at our burgeoning science festivals and Fairs, extensive coverage of science on the BBC and the media more widely.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More students doing science at school, college and university, with new science departments opening as Lancaster University are doing in Chemistry.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imaginative exercises in citizen’s science such as Galaxy Zoo which started in Oxford with volunteers classifying new galaxies.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World-leading Learned Societies such as the Royal Society, which has just celebrated its 350th anniversary and a network of leading charities such as the Wellcome Trust and Cancer Research UK backing scientific research and enquiry. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does of course also mean proper funding for science and research. I realise that there are always pressures for more and we cannot afford to do everything we would like to do. Nevertheless, as countries around the world face budget pressures, our ring- fenced cash-protected science and research funding budget is a good settlement in tough times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakdown of current spending is between four main areas roughly as follows. £1.6 billion goes direct to universities in recognition of research excellence. £150 million goes through Higher Education Innovation Funding to reward universities that have knowledge exchange with the wider world, especially contributing to economic growth. £100 million goes direct to the Learned Societies (the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the British Academy) to fund leading researchers and also make small grants for particularly worthwhile research projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Research Councils and the UK Space Agency between them spend the remaining £2.75 billion. The Research Councils divide this into two main categories - responsive funding and directed funding competitions. They estimate that about two thirds of their funding is in responsive mode and a third in directed mode. The directed mode focuses on the grand challenges such as energy, living with environmental change, our ageing population and lifelong health and well-being. Blue skies research can however be covered by both categories - our contribution to CERN is directed to a very specific project but is also pretty fundamental. And Research Councils do respond to bids for funding for some quite applied research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Councils devote a lot of time and effort to identifying significant ground-breaking areas of research that they should support. They scan the horizon to try to ensure we have a coherent and broad research base in this country. They work with business and Government to identify these priorities. But there comes a point when the Research Councils have to think about impact and priorities. I know this is controversial - and I do receive mass letters from aggrieved sections of academia who fear the Research Councils have failed to recognise their special significance. But it has to be done and the Councils try to do it in an open way that commands the consent of the research community they serve. We must never end up in the position where an individual researcher with a novel idea judged to be of real academic merit is excluded from funding just because it does not fit some preordained plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am releasing reports on the impact of this Research Council funding. We are familiar with how American research funding helped with the creation of great American businesses like Google. But we have similar examples here. The UK’s largest software company, Autonomy, was started by Dr Mike Lynch at Cambridge University in 1996 based on work conducted during his PhD supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council in the UK. Autonomy was sold to Hewlett Packard in August 2011 for over £7 billion. The EPSRC have just been recognised by Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble for their globally best in class support to P&amp;amp;G by a government body. Innovations in solar energy panels and offshore renewable energy are being supported with substantial research funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact doesn’t just mean commerce. Professor Theo Farrell, an ESRC/AHRC Fellow undertook an assessment of the British Army’s performance in Operation Moshtarak, a 2010 offensive to clear the Taliban from central Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan. The resulting classified report was briefed to Army chiefs, and has informed doctrine development and pre-deployment training. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our ring-fence protects research activity. When money is tight we had to give current spending on activity high priority. That is one reason why for the first time the ring fence includes the main forms of current spending on science and research. But the ring fence excludes capital as there is some discretion in the timing of major capital projects. The Government does however understand the importance of investing in science capital as is shown by George Osborne’s excellent decisions over the past year to invest a further £470 million in science capital in top of our original plans. That will go on new facilities, the e-infrastructure needed for world class science, and the further development of our National Campuses at Harwell, Daresbury, Norwich and Babraham. This will bring together world class facilities and researchers and the companies that can benefit from them - contributing further to our high value added growth agenda.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the money from the Research Councils as well as from other sources flows to our universities. In some countries like Germany research tends to happen outside universities - in their Max Planck institutes for example. We have our own outstanding independent research institutes as well, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies to the Institute for Animal Health. The new Crick Institute will be a world leading centre for life sciences. But by and large publicly funded research in Britain is likely to be conducted in our universities. That in turn puts them at the heart of our high tech agenda. Only the other day Professor Eric Thomas, the President of UUK, perhaps influenced by too many Dickensian Christmas cards, told me that if the British economy has been a stagecoach stuck in the mud then our universities are one of the horses that can pull it out. He is absolutely right.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently have 12 universities in the top 100 and 32 in the top 200 according to the Times Higher Education rankings. It is 19 in the top 100 and 30 in the top 200 according to QS. And in the Shanghai rankings it is 10 and 19. The exact numbers and individual universities vary according to the different weighting in the different schemes. But all the university rating agencies agree that only the US does better than we do. Today I set our ambition of aiming for the number of our universities in the top 100 to grow. When you look at our relative weaknesses in these league tables it tends to be teaching and external income. These are the areas where we need to raise our game even more. We are not managing decline we are investing in success. A crucial reason for our controversial changes to the funding of teaching in universities is to ensure they remain well funded even when money is tough. There is no more fair and progressive way of financing university teaching than to expect graduates earning over £21,000 to pay back for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate in having one of the strongest networks of universities in the world. Part of its dynamism has been the ceaseless process of creating new institutions as well as the capacity of existing institutions to grow and develop. University College London was created as a secular alternative to the Oxbridge duopoly. Then we had the great civic universities, the Colleges of Advanced Technology, the plate glass universities and the polytechnics. We have also had new research institutes, campuses, and science parks. That process of creating new institutions should not stop even when times are tough and there is no spare public money. We have to bridge the gap between limited public funding and continuing strong demand for higher education and research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globalisation is still at its early stages when it comes to Higher Education. The next round of new institutions may well link existing British universities with international partners. The surge in international investment in science and technology would make this a key part of the mission of a new foundation. It might be that today’s institutions propose a new campus or a new international partnership. Or it might be new providers wanting to enter with different models. Today I can announce therefore that the Coalition is inviting proposals for a new type of university with a focus on science and technology and on postgraduates. Local economic partnerships, universities, businesses and international partners can come together to put forward proposals for new institutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be no additional Government funding. This time we will be looking to private finance and perhaps sponsorship from some of the businesses that are keen to recruit more British graduates. For example, we will not be diverting funding from support for undergraduate students. It is an opportunity to seize the new freedoms which we proposed in our White Paper last year. We already have a lot of interest and we want to move this to the next level. As proposals are developed we will be able to identify any specific obstacles that need to be removed including by legislation where necessary. A major city might wish to offer a site as Mayor Bloomberg has just done so successfully with his competition for a new graduate school in New York. We will be discussing with the interested organisations how best to carry this initiative forward. I am confident that with ingenuity we can grow our research base and our universities even when times are tough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="linking-the-research-base-and-the-wider-economy"&gt;Linking the research base and the wider economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is enormous scope for universities to go further and build even stronger links with the wider economy. They are after all at the heart of the innovation clusters which will drive our economy in the future. Their external income has increased to £3 billion. But there is more we can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our own challenges. We have relatively low rates of paper co-authorship between industry and academia. We generate just 2.2% of global patents. Business spend on R&amp;amp;D, at £16 billion, is low as a percentage of GDP. This problem has been debated for a long time. The great economist Alfred Marshall wrote in 1919: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“the small band of British scientific men have made revolutionary discoveries in science; but yet the chief fruits of their work have been reaped by businesses in Germany and other countries where industry and science have been in close touch with one another.” (Alfred Marshall, Industry and Trade). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are tackling this age-old problem that we are good at generating great ideas in our universities but less good at turning them into the products and businesses of the future. And we can point to successes such as ARM, Autonomy, Rolls Royce, GSK Jaguar Land Rover and many other companies which have exceptional links to our universities. But we need more of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are reforming IP and backing open innovation in our universities. We are liberating them from the idea that the only measure of their contribution to the wider economy is setting up a tech transfer office and then counting patents. We are extending Innovation vouchers to encourage more small businesses to draw on the resource available in our universities. There is still untapped potential in universities that can be drawn out by organisations like Imperial Innovations or Isis Innovation. I can announce today that our ambition is for university knowledge exchange income from external sources to grow by 10% over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic model expects venture capitalists to be following what is happening in universities and to invest in the IP after the university has spun out a company. This is the conventional sausage machine and it can work on some occasions but it is not widespread or straightforward. We have expected venture capital firms to finance early stage start-ups much further upstream than is realistic. Then we beat up on ourselves that our venture capitalists do not take risks they do in the US when even there the model is rather different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US Federal funding comes from a wide range of agencies - the National Institute for Health, the National Science Foundation and of course DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. They can support research closer to market than Research Councils do. What Americans mean by defence is whatever is necessary for national greatness including ensuring a capacity in any blue skies technology. And then the SBIR the Small Business Innovation Research programme means American start-ups have a chance of getting Federal contracts for their innovative products even as they are still developing them. All this means that you can get federal funding to see you through from idea to product. This eases the pressures on venture capitalists. America does have a much bigger venture capital sector and it is a great advantage to them. But we should look behind the rhetoric at what has been called America’s “ hidden developmental state” explained here by Professor Mazzucato. The land of free enterprise has an innovation and research system which depends on federal and state government just like everywhere else in the Western world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Technology Strategy Board bridges this gap between the Research Councils’ funding for activities in universities and fully commercial development by business. They are working with Research Councils and aligning their funding where that is possible. A crucial weapon in their armoury will be Smart Awards which provide proof of concept and proof of market funding for businesses, then support for the further development of prototype products. Often SMEs are caught in a Catch 22 dilemma where they cannot leverage investment until they have this proof but they haven’t got the relatively small sums you need to pay to get the proof. It was David Young who first introduced Smart Awards in the late eighties to bridge this gap. They were very successful. The very achievement of getting a Smart Award was a signal to perhaps an angel investor that this was a project worth investing in. Under the last Government they were dissipated amongst different RDAs and lost their brand name. Now we are bringing them back as a nationwide scheme run by the TSB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Smart awards span all sectors. But as well as these broadly based schemes we also have to spot specific areas of scientific and technological advance. Nobody can know for sure what are going to be the big technologies of the future but that is not a reason for inaction. Let me now explain the three stages of our high tech policy as we look out for the future prospects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="identifying-key-areas-of-scientific-and-technological-advance"&gt;Identifying key areas of scientific and technological advance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between business sectors and technologies. They overlap but are not the same. We have some crucial business sectors that are seen as high tech - such as aerospace or space. We also have perhaps less glamorous business sectors where innovation is increasingly important - delivering social care, agriculture, utilities, transport and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of Britain’s weak productivity performance has been low levels of investment and innovation in some of these sectors. But they can be transformed by absorbing new technologies - the warehousing and distribution of goods around the UK has been transformed over the past twenty years by new IT systems. Increasingly satellites and space-based systems will transform the accuracy of the spreading of fertiliser and patterns of planting in agriculture. These changes will happen not as the result of technologies developed specifically for say the agricultural sector but as a result of the application of technologies developed elsewhere. They may well be general purpose technologies that spread widely across the economy as electricity or satellites or the internet have done. We need to judge the technologies that will matter in the future. We may not get it right - we won’t always - but we have to try. We are not picking individual business sectors but Government is backing the development of specific key technologies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US they developed a neat way of summarising the big technological advances - the National Science Foundation called them Bio, Nano, Info, and Cogno or BNIC for short. We have heard about the BRICs, the countries where the future growth will come from: the BNICs are the technologies it could well be coming from. This has been a theme of American science policy for over a decade now and it has generated some rather overheated debate about the possible convergence of these technologies. There may be something in this. We can see for example the “wet” biological sciences linking ever more closely with the data processing capacities of “dry” IT as a “ new biology” emerges. Other countries have conducted similar exercises. The High Tech Strategy for Germany lists the following cross-cutting technologies: nanotechnologies, biotechnology, microsystems technology, optical technologies, materials technologies and production technologies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did our own exercise and published the results last year in a report, “Technology and Innovation Futures: UK Growth Opportunities for the 2020s”. It was very British, inductive not deductive, listing the main areas of technological and scientific research over the next decade, drawing on consultations with the academic community. Our experts in the Government Office for Science identified 53 specific future technologies and innovations. They then put them in the following broad categories: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Materials and Nanotechnology; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital and Networks; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy and low carbon technologies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall our horizon scanning broadly matches that of the world’s biggest scientific power. America’s Cogno and Info very roughly come together as our Digital and Networks. Unlike the US we identify a distinctive low carbon technology area so the C in BNIC could stand for Carbo instead. These lists are inevitably imperfect. They change. But they are important. They act as a check on eccentric or lop-sided decisions by making sure we have a clear overview of the main areas we need to invest in. If we are to live up to our ambitions we need coherent programmes for investing in these broad areas of research. That is what we are doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="judging-whether-to-back-specific-technologies-as-they-get-closer-to-market"&gt;Judging whether to back specific technologies as they get closer to market&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as you get closer to market you try to back in particular the technologies which have the greatest potential. This is where the TSB has to exercise a professional judgement on what to support. The TSB’s job is to help “turn today’s emerging technologies into tomorrow’s industries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigorous scrutiny of the cost-effectiveness of investment is necessary. The TSB and BIS apply some crucial tests. The key criteria for backing a technology are that we must have an academic and research presence; the business capability to develop products and services based on the technology; and a good chance of a sizeable global market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that basis the TSB identifies technologies where they see particular potential for the UK. Their most recent assessment suggests for example particularly promising technologies for us are synthetic biology, energy efficient computing and energy harvesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TSB is also setting up a network of elite technology innovation centres, now called Catapult Centres. We have already created three, and I can announce today that the fourth will be in the area of satellite applications. This will provide business with access to in-orbit test facilities to develop and demonstrate new satellite technologies. It will also provide access to advanced systems for data capture and analysis, supporting the development of new services delivered by satellites. These could be in a wide range of areas such as distance learning and telemedicine, urban planning, precision agriculture, traffic management and meteorology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="practical-leadership-from-government"&gt;Practical leadership from Government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Government can help drive forward the development and application of key technologies. I tend to follow quite a standard model for doing this because it seems to work. I first discovered it in the space sector, where a Space Leadership Council was formed in March 2010. It had been set up by Paul Drayson when he was science minister in the last Government. It has been the basis for a template used more widely in BIS - not just by me but by Vince Cable and Mark Prisk as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start by convening a group which has to include leading academic researchers, Research Councils, agencies sponsoring commercialisation like the TSB and of course businesses themselves. They discuss what is happening so everyone can understand the links between the research agenda and commercial opportunities. You ask if they would like to meet again and they normally do. Then you set it up a bit more formally as a leadership council usually co-chaired by a BIS minister and someone from industry. The Council then commissions a technology road map. It is usually written by an expert advised by a group and gives a rough idea of the technological changes that the industry and researchers are expecting over the next five to ten years. So for example Professor Sir Keith O’Nions, Rector of Imperial College kindly prepared a space technology road map last year. That is a basis for everyone to take decisions on where to invest. Some of this may fall to government but business has to make a matching investment in return. That it rests on an agreed plan makes that easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of model is being applied right across BIS. As well as in the space sector this sort of activity is also being led in for example the automotive, aerospace, and life sciences sectors. I can announce today that I am setting up further such leadership councils in e-Infrastructure and in synthetic biology. These are not instruments for ministers to impose their will on reluctant sectors. Nor are they devices to increase public spending. We act as conveners bringing together the key players and driving forward investment and innovation. Sometimes the simple fact that such a group exists increases the confidence of a key new sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-check-list-for-our-high-tech-strategy"&gt;A check list for our high tech strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s finally just review how we are doing in living up to the challenge of these important high tech sectors. We can work through the BNIC list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio is covered by the life sciences strategy which the Prime Minister launched a month ago. It is an ambitious agenda for keeping and strengthening our position in this crucial sector. Our progress is going to be reviewed by two formidable outside experts - Professor Sir John Bell and Chris Brinsmead. But it isn’t the final word. I will continue to work with Andrew Lansley and the Treasury on new ideas for the future. So for example we announced a Bio-medical Catalyst Fund with the Medical Research Council and the TSB backing ideas as they traverse the so-called “valley of death” from research lab to commercialisation. There is £180 million of public money in this fund but it could be even bigger if we could entice some corporate venture funds in as well. That is something I want to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio is not just human health. We have great strengths in biological sciences more widely. After the elimination of Smallpox thirty years ago the UN celebrated the global elimination of a second virus last year. It was rinderpest which affects cattle and other ungulates and blighted agriculture in Africa and elsewhere. British scientists based at the Institute of Animal Health played a key role in this. We have great achievements in crop science too. At the moment we get on average about 9 tonnes of wheat per hectare. The target set by the BBSRC is to get to 20 tonnes per hectare within 20 years. That would be nothing less than a second agricultural revolution and it is essential to feeding the world as wheat provides a fifth of the calories consumed by mankind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthetic biology has been driven by developments in next generation sequencing, DNA synthesis, and systems engineering. It is a potential platform technology with possible applications including bio-energy, industrial biotechnology and chemicals. I have asked leading researchers and business experts in a group chaired by Dr Lionel Clarke of Shell to produce a synthetic biology roadmap to set out the timeframe and actions to establish a world leading synthetic biology industry in the UK. They should report in the Spring after which we intend to convene a new Synthetic Biology Leadership Council to look at how we can deliver that road map. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very term nano-technology was popularised by Federal agencies in the US. It covers a range of technologies across a range of markets. I have convened the key players to sketch out its future relevance to the UK. It is clear graphene is one very significant example of nano-technology. We are committed to establishing a Graphene Global Research and Technology Hub which will provide access to specialist facilities and expertise. TSB and EPSRC have been working together on this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Info and cogno cover many things. The rapid growth of Tech City is a classic example of what can be achieved by sustained attention from the very top of Government. Behind it lies our national capacity in high performance computing. We were in danger of losing our position with very few of the world’s most powerful 500 computers. Increasingly research today involves handling large data sets - be it from CERN, meteorological data, the Hubble telescope, the sequencing of individual genomes, or indeed just keeping up with the academic literature itself with more than a million academic papers in the life sciences published every year. There is more to computing capacity than raw power: software matters too. So we have invested an extra £165 million to ensure our researchers have access to powerful computers and the software to harness them. We also commissioned Dominic Tildesley of Unilever to report on the significance of e-infrastructure for business. I am releasing his report today. It sets out very clearly practical examples of how business can use high powered computing. Companies like Jaguar Land Rover or Rolls Royce need to be able to model completely the functioning of a motor car or a turbine. The more you can do virtually the more rapidly you can test and introduce new products. That is why they say that to out-compete you must out-compute. We will act on his recommendation of an e-Infrastructure Leadership Council to ensure there are strong links between academic research programmes and business applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Carbo is low carbon energy. We already have sponsored research on low carbon cars. The TSB’s investment in low carbon vehicles in partnership with the EPSRC played a significant role in Nissan’s decision to base the production of the entirely electric LEAF model and its advanced batteries in Sunderland. High on our agenda now is nuclear fission and fusion after a challenging report from the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords. We will be considering it carefully to ensure we get most advantage from our historic strengths in these sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very quick review but it is clear that the Coalition is committed to a high tech future for our country and is doing everything possible to secure this future source of growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I have set out 8 steps to high-tech growth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the Government’s goal that we should be the best place in the world to do science; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;released a series of reports showing what the research sponsored by the Research Councils is achieving; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set out our ambition to have more universities in the world’s top 100; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;announced that we have invited proposals for new types of university with a focus on science and technology and on postgraduates; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;announced our ambition for universities’ knowledge exchange funding from external sources to grow by 10% over the next three years; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;announced that the next Catapult Centre will be in the application of satellite technology; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;announced that I am setting up leadership councils in e-Infrastructure and in synthetic biology; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and released a new report on e-infrastructure strategy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critics of our economic policies focus on arguments about a short-term stimulus but what really matters is long term growth. That is what our high tech enterprise strategy is all about. Times like this have persuaded many of us that it is necessary to back the technologies of the future so that we can rebalance our economy. Every Government tries to do it. The only question is whether you recognise it and do it properly or whether you just let it happen as the aggregate of the host of decisions you have to take anyway. This Coalition, faced with the crucial challenge of sustaining growth after the deepest recession since the War, has a strategy for high tech enterprise. We can be proud of it because it is coherent, serious and rests on a commitment to the future of our country and its economic base. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Multi million package announced to boost innovation and research in the UK</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A £75 million boost for high tech small and medium sized businesses is part of a package of measures announced today in the Government's new Innovation and Research Strategy for Growth.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/11-1387-innovation-and-research-strategy-for-growth.pdf"&gt;Innovation and Research Strategy for Growth (PDF, 1.1 Mb) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy, launched by Business Secretary Vince Cable and Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts, sets out the Government’s plans to boost economic growth through investment in research and innovation across the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key actions announced today include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£75 million of new government investment for the Technology Strategy Board to give high tech innovative businesses better access to the facilities and finance they need to develop and commercialise products. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£25 million to help companies develop large scale prototypes that will showcase their ideas to potential investors. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Piloting a new innovation vouchers scheme delivered by the Technology Strategy Board that will give SMEs the opportunity to get free academic support from colleges and universities. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting SMEs by doubling the size of the Designing Demand Programme by £650,000 to £1.3 million a year. This is a mentoring programme run by the Design Council to help SMEs deliver improved products, services and brands to enhance their growth potential. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), to establish a Centre of Expertise for running innovation inducement prizes, and a new Innovation Prize Fund, in which we will invest £250,000 a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK has renowned universities and research institutes and a proud record of invention - from the creation of life-saving medicines to the development of the internet. This strategy builds on our strengths by setting out how we will work with businesses and research bases to underpin private sector led growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We recognise that by improving the incentives for companies to innovate they will continue to create life changing products to drive future innovation and growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government has protected the £4.6 billion annual science and research budget, is investing more than £200 million in the new Catapult Centres and has announced £610 million of science capital projects this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our new innovation and research strategy is the next step in ensuring the UK provides the best possible environment for entrepreneurs and innovators. Alongside the new Smart scheme, fresh initiatives like innovation vouchers for SMEs, more design mentoring and an Innovation Prize Fund will deliver help where it is most needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A new innovation landscape, combined with continued investment and collaboration with business, will ensure the UK is a world leader in innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Innovation and Research Strategy for Growth builds on the Government’s existing Plan for Growth. It follows the recently published Life Sciences Strategy which included £180 million of new investment to support exciting medical breakthroughs, and a further £13 million to the existing £145 million investment in e-infrastructure - to power innovation and growth through the most sophisticated technology. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New £125 million fund to boost UK advanced manufacturing supply chains</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A new initiative of up to £125 million is being set up to improve the global competitiveness of UK advanced manufacturing supply chains, Business Secretary Vince Cable announced today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative aims to help existing UK supply chains grow and achieve world class standards while encouraging major new suppliers to come and manufacture here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new fund will support innovative projects in established UK advanced manufacturing sectors such as aerospace, automotive and chemicals. It will also target newer growth areas where the UK is well placed to take a global lead, such as energy renewables and other low carbon sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitive fund will invite applications early in the new year and will be flexible in the type of support offered to successful proposals, recognising that to fulfil their potential and address market failures suppliers and supply chains may require a combination of investment in capital equipment, associated research and development and improved skills and training support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Recent economic and natural shocks such as the ash clouds, tsunami and Japanese earthquake have shown the fragility of long distance and single source supply chains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to seize on the increased preference that big global companies are showing for co-locating key elements of their supply chains with their UK manufacturing operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“British suppliers have a lot to offer and we need to help them realise and develop their strengths and sell them on the international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While still encouraging free trade I also want to gain maximum value for the UK by ensuring our suppliers are in the best position possible to compete for the very significant new private and public investments being made in the UK over the next few years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme will complement and work alongside other publicly funded schemes such as the Regional Growth Fund, Growth and Innovation Fund, Manufacturing Advisory Service and UK Trade and Investment to maximise impact. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government boost to UK life science industry</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A multi million pound package of support has been announced to support the UK's life sciences industry.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK life science industry is one of the world leaders with more than 4,000 companies, employing around 160,000 people and with a total annual turnover of over £50 billion. In fact, between 2000 and 2010 the UK pharmaceuticals industry (a major part of life sciences) grew faster than any sector of the economy except the finance and insurance sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally the industry is changing with more focus on collaboration, out-sourcing of research and earlier clinical trials with patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can be proud of our past - but we cannot be complacent about our future. The industry is changing; not just year by year, but month by month. We must ensure that the UK stays ahead, yes, we’ve got a leading science base, we’ve got four of the world’s top ten universities, and, we have a National Health Service unlike any other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But these strengths alone are not enough to keep pace with what’s happening - we’ve got to change radically - the way we innovate, the way we collaborate, the way we open up the NHS.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The two reports we’re publishing today are testament to our ambition: not just to hang on in there with a significant foot-hold in the global market, but to take an even bigger share of that market in the years to come. I want the great discoveries of the next decade happening in British labs, the new technologies born in British start-ups.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="life-sciences"&gt;Life Sciences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has launched its &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-1429-strategy-for-uk-life-sciences.pdf"&gt;Life Sciences Strategy (PDF, 1.0 Mb) &lt;/a&gt; and a review of innovation in the NHS to meet this challenge and attract further investment to the UK. The measures bring our science base and the NHS together to ensure the UK is the best place in the world for companies to invest in the discovery, development and commercialisation of medical innovations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes a new £180 million catalyst fund to help the next generation of brilliant British medical breakthroughs become the next generation of great British companies. This fund will target the funding gap that exists - the so called ‘valley of death’ - between the moment that a bright new idea is developed in the laboratory and the point when a new drug or technology can be invested in by the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our life sciences industry is a vital driver of growth and employs tens of thousands of people. But it is rapidly changing. We need to keep ahead of the game and make the UK one of the best places for companies to invest in innovation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To do this we need to create the right environment for scientists and business to work together and translate research into new, cutting-edge technologies and medicines. This will this boost our economy, create new jobs, and lead to better treatments for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK research base most productive in the world</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The UK is a world-leader in science and research according to a new report from BIS.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/science/science-innovation-analysis/uk-research-base"&gt;‘International Comparative Performance of the UK Research Base 2011’&lt;/a&gt; report was compiled by Elsevier and published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shows that UK research attracts more citations per pound spent in overall research and development than any other country. It has also found that the UK research base is highly mobile, internationally competitive and diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his Gareth Roberts Memorial Lecture at the Royal Society of Medicine, Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts will say:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A strong research base is vital to driving growth and innovation. This report highlights both the quality of our researchers and also the ability of our world-class institutions to attract the very best talent to this country.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to maintaining this leading position and building on the UK’s fantastic record of academic and scientific achievement. That’s exactly why we protected the £4.6 billion science and research budget and have invested nearly an additional £300 million in science capital projects over the past year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="main-findings"&gt;Main findings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uk-research-is-high-quality-and-efficient"&gt;UK research is high quality and efficient&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK research attracts more citations per pound spent in overall research and development than any other large country. UK research is top quality, accounting for 14 per cent of the world’s highly-cited articles, the second largest share after the USA. The UK also has more articles per researcher, more citations per researcher, and more usage per article authored than researchers in US, China, Japan and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uk-researchers-are-highly-mobile-and-internationally-competitive"&gt;UK researchers are highly mobile and internationally competitive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1996 and 2010, 63 per cent of UK researchers were also affiliated to a non-UK institution, showing that their knowledge and expertise is valued worldwide. Those who went away for less than a year and returned were 24 per cent more productive than the average, and others who spent longer periods abroad were 66 per cent more productive. These combined patterns of mobility and research excellence demonstrate that the efficient nature of UK research is underpinned by its ability to attract highly productive and internationally mobile researchers to work in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uk-researchers-are-driving-research-performance"&gt;UK researchers are driving research performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International collaboration is sizeable in the UK with half of all articles attributable to the UK in the five years since 2006 having also at least one non-UK author. New research nations like China or Brazil collaborate internationally much less, 15 per cent of their publications in this period. International collaboration underpins research excellence since having non-UK authors doubles the level of citation per article. International collaboration and international mobility reinforce each other as drivers of UK research performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uk-research-is-diverse"&gt;UK research is diverse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of UK research is broad with particular strengths in the clinical sciences, health and medical sciences, social sciences, business and humanities, with high publishing activity and high citation impact in these areas. Even in areas where the publishing activity is not high, like engineering and mathematics, citation impact is higher than the world average, which means research is concentrated in small areas of high influence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uk-researchers-are-driving-innovation"&gt;UK researchers are driving innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportion of moves to the private sector from university in the UK is around 66 per cent, which is similar to other large countries and has been shown to boost innovative activity in firms. There are also strong cross-sector knowledge flows, with more than 70 per cent of all downloads of corporate authored articles coming from users in the academic sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="million-package-to-sharpen-uks-competitive-edge"&gt;£170 million package to sharpen UK’s competitive edge&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="next-phase-in-campaign-to-promote-careers-in-industry"&gt;Next phase in campaign to promote careers in industry&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement sees the creation of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.innovateuk.org/content/news/first-national-technology-innovation-centre-in-hig.ashx"&gt;first Technology and Innovation Centre in high value manufacturing (HVM)&lt;/a&gt; open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable announced the details of the new centre, formed from seven research facilities across the UK, which will receive more than £140 million over the next six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/speeches/vince-cable-innovate-2011"&gt;Read Vince Cable’s speech at Innovate 11,&lt;/a&gt; on government support for UK manufacturing and the technology and Innovation Centres (TICs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="high-value-manufacturing"&gt;High Value Manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HVM centre will help stimulate manufacturing in the UK, reduce the risk of innovation for new and established UK manufacturing businesses, and attract international business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centre will help to kick-start a sustained &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.innovateuk.org/deliveringinnovation/technology-and-innovation-centres.ashx"&gt;manufacturing revival by commercialising science - taking ideas from the drawing board to help make them into real products.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seven regional facilities forming the centre are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.amrc.co.uk/"&gt;Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (Rotherham, part of University of Sheffield) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://namrc.co.uk/"&gt;Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (Rotherham)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.the-mtc.org/"&gt;Manufacturing Technology Centre (Coventry) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.strath.ac.uk/afrc/"&gt;Advanced Forming Research Centre (University of Strathclyde)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nationalcompositescentre.co.uk/"&gt;National Composite Centre (University of Bristol) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk-cpi.com/"&gt;Centre for Process Innovation (Wilton &amp;amp; Sedgefield) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/"&gt;Warwick Manufacturing Group (University of Warwick) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By incorporating the seven institutions, the HVM Technology and Innovation Centre will support a number of different industries including pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, food &amp;amp; beverages, healthcare, aerospace, automotive, energy, chemicals and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Technology Strategy Board (TSB) will also run a competition of nearly £18 million, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.innovateuk.org/content/news/new-government-funding-will-stimulate-growth-creat.ashx"&gt;Technology Inspired Innovation,&lt;/a&gt; to fund products inspired by new discoveries and breakthroughs, such as advanced materials, biosciences and nanoscale technologies.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TSB and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/sustainable/olev/"&gt;Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV)&lt;/a&gt; will also be running a £15 million competition for investment into the research and development of low carbon vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="see-inside-manufacturing"&gt;See Inside Manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure manufacturers have access to the skills they need to remain at the forefront of advanced manufacturing, the Government has launched the new initiative: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/seeinsidemanufacturing/"&gt;See Inside Manufacturing. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is being piloted by businesses in the automotive sector. Between 10-21 October around 100 events are being held across the UK. Companies in the sector are opening their doors to students and young people to help change the perception of careers in the sector and to attract the next generation of engineers and technicians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick-off the latest stage of the campaign, Vince Cable visited the Vauxhall plant in Luton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturing has a key role to play in economic growth and rebalancing the economy, in particular driving exports and productivity.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government is supporting manufacturing through a modern industrial strategy fit for the 21st century. We are assisting manufacturing companies and their supply chains directly through the Regional Growth Fund and other schemes and supporting them to build strong businesses via our commitments to apprenticeships and fostering technology.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are also challenging the perceptions of what it is like to work in manufacturing and seeking to raise the status and profile of engineering.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we know there is always more to do. We will set out further proposals to support manufacturing over the next few weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
