    <title>Princess Royal attends naval cadets' passing out parade</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/thecurrentroyalfamily/theprincessroyal/theprincessroyal.aspx" title="The Princess Royal"&gt;The Princess Royal&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, was the guest of honour at &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s final passing-out-parade of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rain eased off, and with the Royal Marines band playing festive tunes, the Princess Royal was invited to inspect the cadets and take the salute during the march past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parade signified the end of 30 weeks intensive training for the 67 Officer Cadets who can now enjoy Christmas with their families before embarking on the next stage of their Royal Navy careers. Among those passing-out were cadets from 10 overseas nations, who regularly send their personnel to &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt; for training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commanding Officer of &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt;, Captain Jerry Kyd, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were very honoured to have Her Royal Highness visit us for our final parade of the year. These Cadets have been given a thorough induction into the Royal Navy and worked hard to earn their place on the parade ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Princess Royal chats to cadets" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5796/DSC_0146.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They spent the last nine weeks of their training at sea. Some were assigned to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Assault-Ships/HMS-Illustrious" title="HMS Illustrious"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Illustrious&lt;/a&gt;, while others were on board the fleet flagship, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/the-fleet/ships/assault-ships/hms-bulwark" title="HMS Bulwark"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;. Both warships were involved in the Royal Navy’s Cougar 12 deployment working as part of the UK’s Response Force Task Group, exercising with a multitude of other nations in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was an excellent opportunity for the cadets to see at first hand the Royal Navy in operation, working in partnership with our allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Princess Royal has a long association with the Royal Navy. She holds the rank of Rear Admiral as Chief Commandant for Women in the Royal Navy and has special relationships with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Submarines/Fleet-Submarines/Trafalgar-Class/HMS-Talent" title="HMS Talent"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Talent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Assault-Ships/HMS-Albion" title="HMS Albion"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Albion&lt;/a&gt;. The Princess Royal is also Commodore-in-Chief for Portsmouth and last attended a parade at &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt; in 2002, when she represented Her Majesty The Queen at Lord High Admiral’s Divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total 237 &lt;abbr title="Britannia Royal Naval College"&gt;BRNC&lt;/abbr&gt; staff and cadets at varying stages of their training were on parade with music provided by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/band_ply.htm" title="The Band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines Plymouth"&gt;Band of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of leave, the College will re-open in January 2013 for what will be the 150th year of Royal Navy officer training in Dartmouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>MOD launches new Skynet satellite</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra lines of communication will benefit personnel deployed in Afghanistan and other parts of the world, including the Falklands, Cyprus and on ships at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; pictures show the moment that Skynet 5D was launched from French Guiana, South America. It is the fourth satellite of the Skynet 5 project to be put into space since 2007 under a £4bn Private Finance Initiative (&lt;abbr title="Private Finance Initiative"&gt;PFI&lt;/abbr&gt;) programme with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.astrium.eads.net/" title="Astrium website"&gt;Astrium&lt;/a&gt;, who built the satellite and service providers &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.astriumservices.com/" title="Astrium Services"&gt;Astrium Services&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skynet project sustains approximately 800 jobs between the company’s sites in Stevenage, Portsmouth and Corsham, Wiltshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in space, Skynet 5D will travel at speeds of around 10,000 kilometres per hour and is expected to cover around 1.2 billion kilometres during its time in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Skynet 5D satellite is launched from French Guiana" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5790/Decollage_Toucan_010.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Skynet 5D satellite is launched from French Guiana in South America [Picture: S Martin. © ESA-CNES-ARIANESPACE / Optique vidéo du CSG]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonel Mike Griffiths, Head of Networks for the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-equipment-and-support" title="Defence Equipment and Support page on GOV.UK"&gt;Defence Equipment and Support&lt;/a&gt; organisation, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Skynet programme provides vital support to the Armed Forces. The launch of this latest satellite will deliver additional global communications capacity to support our operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/philip-hammond" title="Read about Defence Secretary Philip Hammond"&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The launch of Skynet 5D marks another milestone in this very successful programme. These satellites provide essential secure communication channels for our Armed Forces in Afghanistan and allow all three Services to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of the satellites, Skynet 5A, was launched in March 2007, followed by Skynet 5B in November 2007, and Skynet 5C in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>MOD awards £258 million Sea King helicopter support contract</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" title="Royal Air Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; fleets of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Aircraft/Helicopters/Sea-King-Mk5" title="Sea King Mk5"&gt;Sea Kings&lt;/a&gt; are best known for providing &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Operations/Enduring-Operations/UK/Search-and-Rescue" title="Search and Rescue"&gt;Search and Rescue&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="Search and Rescue"&gt;SAR&lt;/abbr&gt;) services in the UK and Falkland Islands. They can also be used to carry troops and provide airborne surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension to the Sea King Integrated Operational Support (&lt;abbr title="Sea King Integrated Operational Support"&gt;SKIOS&lt;/abbr&gt;) contract will ensure continued technical and maintenance support for the 90-strong helicopter fleet for the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD originally signed the &lt;abbr title="Sea King Integrated Operational Support"&gt;SKIOS&lt;/abbr&gt; arrangement with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.agustawestland.com/" title="AgustaWestland"&gt;AgustaWestland&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 and this is the final phase of the deal which is expected to sustain around 500 jobs at AgustaWestland’s UK headquarters at Yeovil, in the industry supply chain and at several &lt;abbr title="Search and Rescue"&gt;SAR&lt;/abbr&gt; bases across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Royal Navy Sea King Mk4 helicopter" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5786/45153254g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Royal Navy Sea King Mk4 helicopter is pictured on an operation over Helmand Province, Afghanistan (stock image) [Picture: Petty Officer Airman (Photographer) Mez Merrill, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phase of the contract will provide support until Sea King is retired from service in 2016 and replaced by &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Aircraft/Helicopters/Merlin-MK1" title="Merlin MK1"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Philip Dunne said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Sea King helicopter fleet has been in service for over 40 years providing a vital capability in air/sea rescue and surveillance. This maintenance agreement, securing 500 jobs across the UK, demonstrates our commitment to keeping this aircraft in top condition until it is retired from service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Navy Captain Tony Gray, Defence Equipment and Support Sea King Team Leader, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Securing this contract ensures value for money for the taxpayer while maintaining the provision of search-and-rescue helicopters around the UK, 24-hours-a-day throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Recognition for veterans of Arctic Convoys and Bomber Command</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parliament today, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, welcomed the conclusion of the second part of Sir John Holmes’ review into the rules and principles governing the award of military campaign medals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of his review, which was requested by Mr Cameron, Sir John Holmes has recommended recognition for veterans of the Arctic Convoys and Bomber Command Second World War campaigns. The Prime Minister has agreed to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterans of the Arctic Convoy campaigns will get recognition with an Arctic Convoy Star medal. Meanwhile, the aircrew of Bomber Command who played such a vital role in the war will be awarded a Bomber Command clasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Arctic Convoy escort patrol, December 1941" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5776/arcticconvoy.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;View from the cruiser HMS Sheffield during an Arctic Convoy escort patrol, December 1941 [Picture: Lieutenant R G G Coote, Royal Navy. © IWM (A 6892)]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m very pleased that some of the brave men of the Arctic Convoys will get the recognition they so richly deserve for the very dangerous work they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Bomber Command, Sir John concluded they have been treated inconsistently with those who served Fighter Command. He’s therefore recommended – and I also agree - that the heroic aircrews of Bomber Command should be awarded a Bomber Command clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An underwater detonation during a convoy to Russia in September 1942" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5777/arcticconvoy2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My own father served in World War Two and I believe those that have served our country in Bomber Command and on the Arctic Convoy deserve nothing but the utmost respect and admiration from us all. I am delighted that I can confirm that both of these special groups of men who served will be able to receive a new form of recognition next year, as announced by the Prime Minister today. We are looking at the implementation of this and hope to make a further announcement by the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Agreement included a commitment to review the rules surrounding the award of military campaign medals, as part of work to strengthen the military covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the second part of Sir John Holmes’ review will report back in the New Year, when the Ministry of Defence will also set out eligibility criteria for the medals and clasps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-announces-reduction-in-uk-troop-numbers-in-afghanistan"/>
    <title>Prime Minister announces reduction in UK troop numbers in Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/" title="Number 10"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.parliament.uk/" title="UK Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; that UK forces would shift from mentoring Afghan troops at battalion level to brigade level next year. This reflects the progress made in Helmand and the increasing ability and confidence of the Afghan National Security Forces (&lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;) to lead security operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawdown, agreed by the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-security-council" title="National Security Council"&gt;National Security Council&lt;/a&gt; this week, is in line and consistent with both UK military advice and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization&lt;/a&gt; strategy agreed at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/events_66529.htm" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit, Lisbon 2010"&gt;Lisbon Summit in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, under which &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/" title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt;) forces continue to operate across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK forces will end combat operations by the end of 2014. It is part of transition to an enduring commitment to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement comes as the previously announced reduction of UK force levels from 9,500 to 9,000 is being achieved with service personnel due to arrive home in time for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed work on how force levels will reduce in 2013 is ongoing and will be conducted in line with operational requirements and the transition process which remains on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the Afghan forces increasingly take the lead, UK combat operations will give way to an increasing focus on training and advising. By the end of 2013, it is expected that UK forces will not routinely need to mentor Afghan forces below brigade level, allowing the reduction in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The real progress being made on the ground in Helmand province will allow us, on current planning, to reduce British troops to around 5,200 by the end of 2013. This is a direct result of the success of the Afghan National Security Forces in assuming a lead role in delivering security for the Afghan people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The phased process of transition of security responsibility agreed at the Lisbon Summit is well advanced and on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have consistently said that there will not be a cliff-edge reduction in troop numbers at the end of 2014. This gradual drawdown is firmly in line with the planning of our &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; partners and the advice of military commanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UK forces will continue to operate alongside their Afghan counterparts, albeit in lower numbers, until our combat operations cease at the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There remain huge challenges ahead for the Afghan people. Our combat mission is drawing to a close, but our commitment to the Afghan people is long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Members of the Afghan National Army" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5775/JMOCCCT-2012-014_Op_Horhari_Afghan_004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Members of the Afghan National Army take part in an operation in Helmand province (stock image) [Picture: Sergeant Steve Blake RLC, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Afghan National Army and Police have greatly improved in the past years. Their capability has increased so that today they enjoy the trust of some 84 percent of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As they develop, and in agreement with the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;, the efforts of our Armed Forces will continue to shift from a combat role to one that focuses on training, advice and assistance. That will allow us to make appropriate and measured reductions in our force levels in line with the &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; plan and our Chicago commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These drawdown plans are based on military advice and following discussion with General Allen [Commander &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Forces]. I am confident that the progress we have seen in Helmand and across Afghanistan can be maintained and that we can complete the tasks we have been set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To be in the position where we are now able to commit to reducing UK force levels to around 5,200 by the end of next year is testament to the professionalism and courage of those personnel who have served, and continue to serve, in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must remember that the UK’s commitment to the operation in Afghanistan will continue beyond the end of 2014 as &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/" title="Department for International Development"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for International Development"&gt;DFID&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [Department for International Development] and the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office" title="Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office"&gt;Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt; continue to build the government and nation while the UK’s pledge to support the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;, including training the military’s officers, will be ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant progress in Afghanistan continues with 75% of the Afghan population now being secured by the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; and at least 80% of all patrols being &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt;-led.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of 80 UK bases at the start of the HERRICK 16 deployment this April, only 32 remain active with the others having been handed over to Afghan forces or closed. Afghan National Army numbers in Helmand province now stand at about 18,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Monmouth reassures shipping with anti-piracy exercise</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plymouth frigate &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Frigates/HMS-Monmouth" title="HMS Monmouth"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth&lt;/a&gt; joined forces with a United States warship and air power for an exercise involving the military and merchant shipping to show how the two can work together to ensure safe passage on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth, known as the Black Duke, was given the task of providing close-in protection to two huge tankers - including the Bahamian-registered Arcturus Voyager (333 metres long and displacing 160,000 tonnes) which travels at only 5 knots/6 miles per hour (9.26 kilometres per hour).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK warship was supported by &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.navy.mil/" title="US Navy"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United States"&gt;US&lt;/abbr&gt; Navy&lt;/a&gt; and coast guard patrol ships, a supply vessel and the air-defence destroyer &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.churchill.navy.mil/" title="USS Winston S Churchill"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United States Ship"&gt;USS&lt;/abbr&gt; Winston S Churchill&lt;/a&gt; - with a Royal Navy navigator aboard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth (foreground) and a &lt;abbr title="United States"&gt;US&lt;/abbr&gt; warship [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aircraft involved were a &lt;abbr title="United States"&gt;US&lt;/abbr&gt; Seahawk helicopter, Orion eye-in-the-sky patrol aircraft, F18 Super Hornets and &lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth’s own &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Aircraft/Helicopters/Lynx-Mk8" title="Lynx Mk8"&gt;Lynx helicopter&lt;/a&gt; which landed &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/The-Royal-Marines" title="Royal Marines"&gt;Royal Marines&lt;/a&gt; boarding team by rapid roping on to the Arcturus Voyager while smaller boats delivered the rest of the boarders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrated how the Royal Navy responds to pirates or terrorists threatening merchant vessels - exactly as Royal Marine commandos from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Royal-Fleet-Auxiliary/Stores/RFA-Fort-Victoria" title="RFA Fort Victoria"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Royal Fleet Auxiliary"&gt;RFA&lt;/abbr&gt; Fort Victoria&lt;/a&gt; did on the Italian MV Montecristo in 2011, to free the crew from pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Chris Hollingworth, principal warfare officer in &lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Monmouth on exercise with a tanker " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5767/HMS_Monmouth_exercises_with_tanker_in_Gulf_2012g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth on exercise with a tanker in the Gulf [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was great to be able to demonstrate to the tanker captains how we would be able to deal with threats and offer them a level of protection. We were able to neutralise potential threats by both directing support aircraft and using our 4.5-inch [114 millimetres] Mk8 gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth’s commanding officer Commander Gordon Ruddock said of the exercise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It will give confidence to the merchant marine community that we are ready, willing and able to protect them should they need us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With fully-laden cargos of over 150,000 tonnes, it is important that merchant ships such as these are able to transport their cargo around the world without fear of piracy or other attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Monmouth on exercise in the Gulf" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5768/HMS_Monmouth_Gulf_exercise_with_US_Navy___tankers_2012g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Monmouth on exercise in the Gulf with &lt;abbr title="United States"&gt;US&lt;/abbr&gt; Navy and tankers [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ship has recently taken over from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Diamond" title="HMS Diamond"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Her Majesty's Ship"&gt;HMS&lt;/abbr&gt; Diamond&lt;/a&gt; on patrol until returning to Plymouth in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patrol is vital to UK and world trade because each day 17 million barrels of oil pass through the Strait of Hormuz, while 3-4 million barrels are moved through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait, gateway to the Red Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a typical week, more than 500 ships pass through Hormuz - 3 in every 5 of them energy carriers (including liquefied natural gas which is used in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise tested mock crisis centre staff in Bahrain, merchant sailors and the military response should shipping come under terrorist attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Protector takes to the ice for a charity Santa run</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Santas, accompanied by Rudolph, were gathered at 10am for a gentle warm-up led by the Executive Officer, Commander Don Mackinnon, who is currently in command for this Antarctic patrol, before it was ‘on your marks, get set… ho ho ho’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Santa run was conducted on ice in the waters surrounding Deception Island, a dormant, water-filled caldera volcano; one of only two known in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking through a sheet of snow-covered ice before coming to a planned stop, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Patrol-and-Minehunters/Ice-Patrol-and-Survey-Ships/HMS-Protector" title="HMS Protector"&gt;HMS Protector&lt;/a&gt; took position and disembarked her personnel to test the ice conditions and drill ice core samples to ensure the ice was safe, before Protector’s eager Father Christmasses followed via the ship’s accommodation ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid perfect weather conditions, and under the watchful eye of two seals that had taken up post next to the ship, they completed their run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Protector's Father Christmasses on the start line" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5743/protector2g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HMS Protector's Father Christmasses on the start line, ready for the off [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Arron Hoare, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annually, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.each.org.uk/" title="East Anglian Children's Hospice"&gt;East Anglian Children’s Hospice&lt;/a&gt; conducts nine Santa runs across Essex and East Anglia throughout the festive period, raising thousands of pounds for the charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is traditional for Royal Naval ships to adopt a charity from their affiliated town so that they can fundraise whilst away from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the work that HMS Protector conducts in Antarctica, she has formed a close liaison with a number of organisations in the Cambridge area (amongst them the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/" title="British Antarctic Survey"&gt;British Antarctic Survey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/" title="Scott Polar Research Institute"&gt;Scott Polar Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;) and as such is affiliated to the City of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Protector has been affiliated with the East Anglian Children’s Hospice since August 2012. The East Anglian Children’s Hospice provides support to families and care for children and young people with life-threatening conditions across Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rudolph (Able Seaman Scott) Royal Navy" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5744/protector3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rudolph (Able Seaman Scott) gets off to a flying start [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Arron Hoare, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing care and support wherever the family wishes, in families’ own homes, in the community or at the hospices, their care teams help children and their families with the emotional and physical challenges they face, helping them to make the most of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Don Mackinnon stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With 21 hours of daylight in every 24, our working day in Antarctica tends to be a long one. Yesterday for example our first boat group departed the ship at 0830 [8.30am] in the morning and the last one finally got back at 2300 [11pm] that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With that sort of work pace it’s nice to be able to take a break from operations now and again, and do something both for fun, and also to help our affiliated charity at the same time. Father Christmas’s traditional home might be the North Pole… but as you can see, he has helpers that visit the other one too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Protector is currently in the Antarctic in order to support an international team conducting formal &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm" title="The Antarctic Treaty"&gt;Antarctic Treaty&lt;/a&gt; inspections of sites across the Peninsula, whilst maintaining a UK Sovereign presence in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://britishantarcticterritory.fco.gov.uk/en/" title="British Antarctic Territory"&gt;British Antarctic Territory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Protector's Father Christmasses" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5745/protector4g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HMS Protector's Father Christmasses lie on the ice to spell out EACH [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Arron Hoare, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office" title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/a&gt; and with the support of the British Antarctic Survey and observers from HMS Protector, the international Antarctic Treaty team is inspecting a number of scientific stations, historic sites, cruise vessels and yachts in the Antarctic Peninsula region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Protector will be operating in and around Antarctica until April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Christmas joy for old soldier who finally got his medal</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army veteran Joe McKenna, 72, who volunteers at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lancashireinfantrymuseum.org.uk/" title="Duke of Lancaster's Regiment Lancashire Infantry Museum"&gt;Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment Lancashire Infantry Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Preston, left the military in 1970 just months before his Northern Ireland service medal was minted and eventually decided to track down his medal after years of attending parades where he was the only veteran not wearing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Major Bob Dixon, from 2 Medical Regiment and a fellow volunteer at the museum, offered to help Joe claim his honour. Sergeant Major Dixon said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I had been helping some visitors at the museum with enquiries about their service medals and so I offered to help Joe too. I got all the paperwork together, went around to his house, and we filled in the documents before sending them off to the MOD Medal Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We got a reply within 2 months, the quickest I’ve ever known; I think the turnaround was so fast because he still lives at the same address that appeared on his service papers back in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe enlisted in the Loyal Regiment, a forebear to the North West’s current infantry regiment &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/3477.aspx" title="The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment"&gt;The Duke of Lancaster’s&lt;/a&gt;, almost exactly 51 years ago and served in Kenya, Swaziland, Cyprus and Malta as well as in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Northern Ireland service medal" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5711/Joe_smedal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Joe McKenna's Northern Ireland service medal [Picture: Sergeant Mark Garry, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he left the Army as a Lance Corporal in 1970, Joe worked for more than 30 years as an &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; driver, married Josie, with whom he had his children Sandra and Peter, and is now a grandfather of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe said until recently the distractions of day-to-day life meant he just never got around to claiming what was his: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was only when I was marching at the Armed Forces Day parade in Preston last summer when I thought ‘I’m getting on a bit now and I should really get my medal’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think my son would like to have it when I’m gone; he and my daughter think that it is marvellous that it’s finally here. It’s the best Christmas present ever and it makes me very proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe’s wife Josie added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It really was something special to see his face when he received the medal; it was as if all his Christmases had come at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe now plans to wear his medal at his regiment’s Kimberley Day service and parade in February 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Sutherland returns in time for Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ship was greeted by cheering and waving families and friends wearing festive hats and holding banners with loving messages at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Naval-Bases/Devonport" title="HMNB Devonport"&gt;HM Naval Base Devonport&lt;/a&gt; in Plymouth on Saturday 15 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship’s Culdrose-based &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Aircraft/Helicopters/Merlin-MK1" title="Merlin"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; helicopter flight arrived back separately at the Helston air station on Friday 14 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Frigates/HMS-Sutherland" title="HMS Sutherland"&gt;HMS Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; has been busy conducting anti-piracy and terrorism patrols as part of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Operations/Enduring-Operations/Middle-East/Combined-Maritime-Forces" title="Combined Maritime Forces"&gt;Combined Maritime Forces&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring the sea lanes and waters east of Suez and off the Horn of Africa are safe for seafarers to conduct their daily business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship conducted boarding operations on suspect vessels and also reassurance visits to build relationships with mariners and obtain information on pattern of life in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="AS(ME) Dale Plumpton kissing Terri Layden" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5729/Sutherland5g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Able Seaman (Marine Engineering) Dale Plumpton receives a welcome home kiss from Terri Layden [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Vicki Benwell, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crew also exercised with coalition and allied forces in the region to strengthen ties and improve methods of working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Sutherland’s Commanding Officer, Commander Al Wilson, said it was a ‘magic’ time to come home at Christmas. He added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The huge variety and diversity of task that Sutherland has fulfilled whilst on operations illustrates the inherent flexibility of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; in protecting and promoting UK interests worldwide, whether it is preventing piracy or terrorism at sea or strengthening bonds with regional allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, I could not have achieved this without an efficient, capable and highly motivated ship’s company and, as always, I am highly proud of what my team has achieved over the last 6 months whilst remaining cheerful and utterly professional throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My team and myself are now looking forward to spending Christmas at home with our loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Royal Navy personnel on board HMS Sutherland" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5730/Sutherland4g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HMS Sutherland is my first ship and I joined her 3 months prior to deploying on operations. With this being my first deployment and first time away from the UK I was nervous, but excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There have been some tough times, but overall I have really enjoyed it, especially the team spirit of the ship and all the good work that we have achieved on operations. My most memorable moment was helping out at an orphanage in Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having handed over duties to sister ship &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Frigates/HMS-Northumberland" title="HMS Northumberland"&gt;HMS Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; at the end of November, the crew of HMS Sutherland is now looking forward to spending Christmas at home and time with families and friends before a busy 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-secretary-welcomes-defence-reform-annual-report"/>
    <title>Defence Secretary welcomes Defence Reform annual report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the Secretary of State, Lord Levene congratulated the Department on strong progress made against the 53 recommendations since the publication of the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-reform-an-independent-report-into-the-structure-and-management-of-the-ministry-of-defence--2" title="Defence Reform Report, June 2011"&gt;Defence Reform Report&lt;/a&gt; in June 2011 and said that he believes the programme is being run with genuine urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full report, with the new annex by Lord Levene, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-reform-an-independent-report-into-the-structure-and-management-of-the-ministry-of-defence--2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome Lord Levene’s recognition of the strong progress made to date in implementing his recommendations, and his confidence that we can deliver transition to a new operating model for the Ministry of Defence in April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of the key changes of Defence Reform are already complete, such as strengthened top-level decision-making and the focus on strategic direction from a newly-constituted Defence Board, which I chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-joint-forces-command-established--2" title="Read more about the establishment of the Joint Forces Command"&gt;The Joint Forces Command has been established&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14926288" title="Read more about the appointment of the first Commander of the UK's Joint Forces Command"&gt;first Commander appointed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many other recommendations are on track for delivery by April 2013, including the delegation of financial and military capability management to give the Service Chiefs greater accountability and freedom to manage their resources and plan for future capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A few recommendations will take longer to complete: I acknowledge that there is more to do in some areas, such as development of the Whole Force Concept and the delivery of improved Management Information, and I value Lord Levene’s continued interest and focus on these important changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am confident, though, that by April [2013] we will have gone a long way towards achieving the aim of the Defence Reform programme: a smaller more professional MOD that is better at supporting the Armed Forces now, and looking forward to Future Force 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VIDEO: HMS Edinburgh sends home festive cheer</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 260 sailors serving on board &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-42-Destroyers/HMS-Edinburgh" title="HMS Edinburgh"&gt;HMS Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; will spend the festive season on board the Portsmouth-based warship while she sails the South Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a bid to spread some Christmas cheer the personnel have donned their smartest Santa outfits and created a video for their loved ones set to The Darkness’ Christmas Time (Don’t Let The Bells End):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEz0dfCrqaI" title="HMS Edinburgh Christmas Video"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video features scenes from around the ship with sailors wearing Santa hats, Christmas cracker outfits and elf costumes waving hello to family and friends from thousands of miles away at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the crew have also made videos to send back to their home towns - the full selection can be seen on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/royalnavyofficial" title="Royal Navy Official YouTube channel"&gt;Royal Navy’s official YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commanding Officer of HMS Edinburgh, Commander Nick Borbone, who will be away from wife Joanne and children Barney, 9, Eddie, 6, and Amy, 5, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It will be strange not being there on Christmas Day and I will miss seeing them, but they have lots of friends and family to keep them entertained and I will call them to see how they are getting on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a tough time of year to be away, but I expect there will be a good festive spirit on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of the Royal Navy’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-42-Destroyers" title="Type 42 destroyers"&gt;Type 42 destroyers&lt;/a&gt;, HMS Edinburgh is halfway through a six-month deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks a historic milestone for both the ship and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; as it will be the last time a Type 42 destroyer deploys on operations as they make way for the new-generation &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers" title="Type 45 Destroyers"&gt;Type 45 destroyers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Edinburgh is undertaking a range of tasks across the length of the Atlantic in support of British interests. Her tasking will see her supporting counter-narcotics efforts in the West African region as well as providing reassurance to UK territories and dependencies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Borbone will be the last commanding officer of a Type 42 destroyer. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a real privilege. HMS Edinburgh might be the last of the class but she remains a capable ship with a highly-trained and motivated ship’s company that is determined to preserve the fine tradition that the Type 42s have established in 30 years of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Female Officer Cadet wins Sandhurst's Sword of Honour</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top accolade from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/training/17057.aspx" title="Royal Military Academy Sandhurst"&gt;Royal Military Academy Sandhurst&lt;/a&gt; was awarded to Officer Cadet Sarah Hunter-Choat, who received the award during her commissioning at the Sovereign’s Parade on Friday 14 December.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highly coveted Sword of Honour is presented to the best overall Officer Cadet out of 200 in the senior term and is personally chosen by the Academy’s Commandant, Major General Timothy Evans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the 200 cadets have their performance rigorously monitored throughout the year. Then, going into the final phase of their training, the 3 top candidates, termed ‘blade runners’, are carefully scrutinised then brought before the Commandant for a final interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officer Cadet Hunter-Choat received the Sword of Honour from Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who represented Her Majesty The Queen at the Sovereign’s Parade. It has been 6 years since a female officer won, when Angela Laycock was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in December 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officer Cadet Hunter-Choat’s success follows in her parents’ footsteps. Her father Brigadier Tony Hunter-Choat had a long, distinguished military career, starting out in the French Foreign Legion before commissioning into the British Army, while her mother is a former RAF officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>MOD to auction off radio spectrum</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radio spectrum refers to the radio waves over which all wireless communication takes place, including radio, television, radar, satellite, mobile voice and data. Under plans announced today, the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; intends to auction around 200 Megahertz (&lt;abbr title="Megahertz"&gt;MHz&lt;/abbr&gt;) of its spectrum usage rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as market demand for extra spectrum is mounting, fuelled by the sharp rise in the use of spectrum-hungry devices such as smartphones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sale will give private operators the chance to buy more spectrum to support the introduction of fourth-generation mobile services to people in cities, towns and villages across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively the spectrum could be used by fixed-line operators to provide wireless access to broadband services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectrum being sold by the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; is all below 15 Gigahertz (&lt;abbr title="Gigahertz"&gt;GHz&lt;/abbr&gt;) which is regarded as the most useful and valuable part of the radio spectrum because of its wide range of applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost half of all spectrum below 15GHz is held by the public sector and is used for a broad range of services including defence, emergency services, transport and science. The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; holds around three-quarters of all publicly-held spectrum and one-third of all spectrum below 15GHz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Philip Dunne, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We welcome this opportunity to free up much-needed spectrum. We hope that the sale will help drive the roll-out of new generation networks and universal access to broadband, both of which are vital to the UK’s prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sale follows the announcement made in the Government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/spend_index.htm" title="Spending Review"&gt;2010 Spending Review&lt;/a&gt; that at least 500MHz of public spectrum below 5GHz will be released by 2020 for new mobile communications uses. The spectrum to be sold off is being cleared of military users to contribute towards this target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparations are expected to start at the end of 2013, with the auction completed by the summer of 2014. Ahead of this, the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; intends to produce an Industry Brochure in early spring 2013 and to host an Industry Day in early summer 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>RAF Brize Norton counting down to Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we take a closer look at how &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafbrizenorton/" title="RAF Brize Norton"&gt;RAF Brize Norton&lt;/a&gt; in Oxfordshire prepares for the festive season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-boss"&gt;The boss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAF Brize Norton is the largest station in the RAF and has approximately 6,000 Service personnel and 1,400 MOD civil servants and contractors. It is the home of the Air Mobility Squadrons and the ‘gateway to operations’ as the main airport used for deploying UK troops worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station never sleeps and supports operations around the world 24/7, 365-days-a-year. Station Commander Group Captain Steve Lushington and his family will be serving Christmas dinner to the junior ranks on the big day. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the festive season gets into full swing, for personnel at RAF Brize Norton work continues as normal. The support to operations is paramount; even during the festive period personnel are still required to be on duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pilots and engineers on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/216squadron.cfm" title="216 Squadron"&gt;216 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/99squadron.cfm" title="99 Squadron"&gt;99 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; maintain their high readiness state, personnel continue to control from the tower, operations staff continue to plan missions and taskings, all supporting tri-Service personnel across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="squadron"&gt;99 Squadron&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Group Captain Steve Lushington" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5706/Brize1g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Group Captain Steve Lushington, Station Commander at RAF Brize Norton [Picture: Paul Crouch, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/c17aglobemaster.cfm" title="C-17 Globemaster"&gt;C-17 Globemaster&lt;/a&gt; is a huge, heavy-lift transport aircraft operated by 99 Squadron. It can carry troops and all types of cargo around the world, including transporting &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/merlin.cfm" title="Merlin"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/chinook.cfm" title="Chinook"&gt;Chinook&lt;/a&gt; helicopters direct to the front line in Afghanistan to provide support to ground troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wing Commander Stuart Lindsell is the Officer Commanding 99 Squadron and has volunteered to cover Christmas duties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The squadron is 300-plus-strong and moves an immense amount of personal mail and parcels from families and loved ones. It’s rewarding for us to know that we are helping to play a part in connecting Service families who are separated over the Christmas period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s very much ‘business as usual’ for 99 Squadron; we have crews covering aeromed standby, a crew based in the Middle East ready for normal tasking. The squadron engineers stand ready to generate an aircraft at short notice should an aeromed mission be called and they will also be manning the engineer control desks as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best way to look at it is hopefully Christmas Day itself will be quiet, but Christmas Eve, Boxing Day and to that extent the New Year period are no different to any other time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festive season can bring wintry conditions and, a couple of years ago, when the UK was gripped by sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfalls, in the thick of it were 99 Squadron who battled to get troops home for Christmas. Wing Commander Lindsell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Snow and ice are certainly not ideal flying conditions to say the least but as a station we are better off than we were when the wintry conditions of 2010 hit. We did manage to get everyone home but it was certainly a challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="snow-and-ice-operations"&gt;Snow and ice operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Corporal John Oliver" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5707/Brize3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Corporal John Oliver from the Airfield Support Mechanical Transport section [Picture: Paul Crouch, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporal John Oliver will also be on standby during Christmas and works at the Complete Equipment Schedule Store at Airfield Support Mechanical Transport that, amongst other things, makes sure vehicles are in working order. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve spent the last 2 months preparing and bringing online all the snow and ice prevention vehicles as they are not used during the summer months; we inflate their tyres, fill the vehicle up with whatever fluid it needs, test it and carry out daily inspections to make sure they are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If it was horrendous snow the main vehicle we would use is the airfield snow clearing vehicle or the compact jet sweeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicles are equipped to plough snow, break up compact ice and blow snow, broken ice or other debris to the side. Corporal Oliver continued:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My job is to make sure we have a serviceable fleet of vehicles to meet the minimum required to clear the airfield. It’s a priority to clear the runway and certain bays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Getting the airfield cleared is very important for the ‘airbridge’, especially for those personnel that want to get home in the last couple of days before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="air-movements-squadron"&gt;Air Movements Squadron&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wendy James, Corporal Mark Watson and Sergeant Shaun Anderson" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5708/Brize4g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Wendy James, Corporal Mark Watson and Sergeant Shaun Anderson getting into the festive spirit at a check-in desk in the air terminal [Picture: Paul Crouch, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporal Emma Hopkinson works on the passenger check-in desk in the air terminal for the Air Movements Squadron. She said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s like a civilian airport. The difference is, if I went for a job in a civilian airport I would only just be either a check-in girl, departures, or elsewhere in the building, whereas here at Brize we have to multi-task and do everything - one minute I could be behind the check-in desk, then I could be on the check-through or departures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We see the whole process through and make sure that nobody is left behind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked what it’s like checking in troops knowing they will be away for Christmas, Corporal Hopkinson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My job is no different at Christmas, the process is still the same, it’s the personalities and how people are with you, and how you are with them - I try and be a bit more jolly! I’ve done Iraq, Afghanistan and Ascension Island at Christmas, so I know what it’s like being away at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Hopkinson will be on shift during the Christmas period but sets aside a day in the new year to have a ‘Christmas Day’ with her family:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I remember one year my mum bought a second turkey and it stayed in the freezer until February! I go to college and have met a lot of people and they are surprised I’m working Christmas Eve and Christmas Day - they ask ‘are you open?’ and I say yes! it’s a 24/7 camp, and it’s the same for New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="christmas-presence"&gt;Christmas ‘presence’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reverend Squadron Leader Kevin Caplin-Jones" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5709/Brize5g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Reverend Squadron Leader Kevin Caplin-Jones, otherwise known as 'Kev the Rev', will be working over the New Year period [Picture: Paul Crouch, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the station itself, the chapel is open 24/7, and for the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/chaplains/" title="RAF Chaplains"&gt;RAF chaplains&lt;/a&gt; the run-up to Christmas is always busy. Reverend Squadron Leader Kevin Caplin-Jones, otherwise known as ‘Kev the Rev’, will be working over the New Year period, but last year was on duty over Christmas. He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because our senior chaplain was away on ops, I joined other officers on station and helped serve Christmas lunch in the Junior Ranks Mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a great experience, my wife was with me and some personnel brought family along. There was that family feel, the military family; everyone was in very good spirits as the portions of potatoes were getting bigger and bigger!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We often think about the people who are deployed at home or overseas, but it’s harder for the families left behind. Service people will make the most of it, no matter what, and I’m sure they get an extra mince pie or an extra bit of turkey and will make the most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s the families left behind and the kids that don’t have their mum or dad with them on Christmas Day that find it hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The best gift at Christmas is ‘presence’. For those who have had loved ones away last year, they will know that having loved ones around is the best gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If not ‘presence’, instantaneous communication such as emails and Skype is great; however, people underestimate e-blueys and handwritten letters - they have that personal touch which means so much to people and always makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Portland sets sail after £27 million refit</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 260,000 man-hours invested in the almost year-long project, the 133-metre &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Frigates/HMS-Portland" title="HMS Portland"&gt;HMS Portland&lt;/a&gt; has returned to sea bristling with the latest high-tech equipment, maintaining its role at the cutting-edge of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" title="Royal Navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 19 major system and capability upgrades have been undertaken on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Frigates" title="Type 23 frigates"&gt;Type 23 frigate&lt;/a&gt;, including the installation of new anti-submarine warfare sonar, full upgrade of the ship’s computer systems, an overhaul of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Weapons-Systems/Seawolf" title="Seawolf"&gt;Seawolf&lt;/a&gt; missile system, replacement of guns, refurbishment of the galley and upgrades of accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship sailed underneath the famous Forth Bridges having had a total exterior makeover too, with 15,000 litres of paint having been applied to her hull and superstructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Sarah West, Commanding Officer of HMS Portland, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am very much looking forward to getting this fantastic ship back to sea to put her through her paces. In tandem with the MOD and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.babcockinternational.com/" title="Babcock"&gt;Babcock&lt;/a&gt;, the crew has spent many long months working hard to return HMS Portland to fighting form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Portland " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5675/NE120458002g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HMS Portland sails from Rosyth following her refit [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Ian Arthur, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ship is equipped for the many future challenges which greet the modern fleet and we are ready to be with her every step of the way. It is an exciting moment returning a warship to sea after refit - we know that HMS Portland is in great shape for regaining full operational readiness early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has benefited from close partnership between Babcock, the MOD, ship personnel and the team under the Surface Ship Support Alliance, resulting in the refit programme being delivered on time and budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babcock project manager Russell Glancy said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have successfully met the challenges of this project, and applied our experience from previous Type 23 refits, along with strong partnering, to ensure delivery of this upgrade and maintenance programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Portland will undertake a further 3 months of sea trials and training before returning to the fleet as a fully operational ship, prepared at any time to take on duties worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3,500-tonne Type 23 frigates, of which there are 13 in the fleet, are flexible and adaptable ships which protect the UK’s interests both in home waters and further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical deployments will include anything from the fleet ready escort, which is the UK’s high readiness ship, to counter-narcotics, piracy and terrorism patrols and the ship can provide humanitarian intervention and security when required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards speech to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), 17 December 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you Lord Hutton for your kind introduction.  It is good to see so many friends and colleagues here and may I take the opportunity to thank you all for your strong support to the Armed Forces.  It is hugely appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am feeling slightly cautious this evening.  Our senior Defence Attaché in the Americas tells me that in the Aztec calendar today is the Day of the Lizard.  They say:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘The warrior must be like the lizard, who is not hurt by a high fall but, instead, immediately climbs back to its perch.  These are good days to keep out of sight; bad days to attract attention.’&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So perhaps today isn’t the best time to be standing before you!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In honouring my commitment to this august organisation that plays such an important role in the life of UK Defence, I want to take the opportunity to examine where we are today, what deductions we should draw, and what we are doing to ensure we are prepared for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are all aware of how much change there has been over the past two years.  We have begun to introduce the SDSR, balanced the books and turned a corner in Afghanistan.  Yet much of the world seems less stable and more dangerous than was the case even two years ago; a harsh world in which intra-state conflict can be confused by and for new forms of inter-state conflict.  A world in which governance vacuums present opportunities for extremist groups to perpetrate large-scale violence and disruption, especially as precision-strike capabilities, cyber instruments and bio terror weaponry become inevitably more accessible.  And this in a period when economic fragility makes us both more vulnerable and less able to respond in a confident and timely manner, a reality aggravated by the huge cost differentials between western forces and non-state opponents. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this is demanding much from all of us and is changing the shape and capabilities of the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together with my fellow Chiefs I have been examining, as you would expect, how we should best use what we have and what we need for the future.  We have to be hard-nosed realists; accepting we have less than we would wish but that we are still required to protect this nation’s interests through the projection of military force.  We cannot shrug our shoulders and hope the problem will go away.  We have to be ready to fight and fight effectively, often not on our own terms and accepting the constraints we are under.  I have brought this together in a piece of work I will be sharing in the future called How We Will Fight.  And I will look at some of its key deductions in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should be under no illusions; the Armed Forces of tomorrow, like those of today, will be engaged in operations around the world.  They will require the best of their generation as they always have.  People who can think flexibly and with imagination.  As Einstein said, “imagination is more important than knowledge”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These operations will not be carbon copies of Afghanistan or Libya.  But they will require the same skill and dedication that these operations, and all the others we have engaged in since the Cold War, have demanded.  They will require the strength and indeed guile that our Army, Navy and Air Force are famous for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on the battle-winning reputation, proven resilience and technological edge of the past decade, I hope you won’t notice some of the tasks the Armed Forces will be doing.  They will be performing a key part of our developing military strategy – deterrence.  Preventing conflict, you may recall, is rightly a principal task of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will come back to this theme later but it is worth remembering that your Armed Forces are often most effective when they are not in the headlines.  Few operations, exercises or training missions are widely reported but each one communicates that we are strong, credible and reliable.  This deters our enemies and reassures our friends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we should be proud of our nation’s record in this respect.  The relative peace we have enjoyed here in the UK for the past 70 years is not an accident.  It is in large part the result of the quiet work of diplomats building friendships, the skill of our financiers and businessmen in making our economy strong, and the courage of our Armed Forces in deterring and when necessary overcoming threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afghanistan is an example of this lesson.  With our partners in NATO/ISAF and the ANSF we have been more successful than many, regrettably, recognise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have recently returned from a visit there and, I can tell you, we are meeting the tasks laid on us.  Over the past decade we have:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	closed Al Qaeda’s bolthole ;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	helped underpin a more stable government;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	overseen elections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;d.	trained an Army and police force;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;e.	and put a country that suffered 30-years of war into a position where industry, education and the rule of law are beginning to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True, there is a long way to go.  The presidential elections in 2014 will be hugely important.  But we are heading in the right direction and we have proved what can be done with the right resources and with the right support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look forward to 2013 seeing us increasingly transition to an Afghan lead as we move from mentoring battalions to supporting brigades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Afghan Army now enjoys the support and trust of 84 percent of the country, only 3 percent less than the British Army in this country.  That is a fantastic achievement, by them and ISAF.  It recognises the integral part they are playing in turning the destiny of a country away from violence and onto a path of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am proud of what our Service men and women have achieved in Afghanistan.  Alongside partners in DFID and the Foreign Office we have given Afghans a chance they couldn’t have dreamt of only a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our operation in Afghanistan does not stand alone.  It is linked to Pakistan and India and the wider region.  In my recent trip to Islamabad, a city I have got to know well, I was very encouraged by the helpful attitude of civilian and military leaders to reconciling the Taliban.  The Taliban, like us, are focussed on Afghanistan’s presidential poll and the end of our combat operations in 2014.  They know that the window of opportunity to play a role in their country’s future is closing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every day the Afghan Army and Police grow in capability and legitimacy.  Every day the government is better able to serve its people and thus better able to marginalise the Taliban.  Now, surely, the time is ripe to take risk in order to find that elusive political solution 10 years of military effort and sacrifice has sought to create the conditions for?  But in order to pull this off, it is vital that Afghan confidence in the West’s long-term commitment to their country is retained.  Why, should this be lost, would they stay the course themselves let alone fight to protect us in 2014 when, absent successful reconciliation, we will be at our most vulnerable?  And why should the Taliban reconcile, if they thought we were ‘cutting and running’?  Retaining Afghan confidence is the campaign’s centre of gravity.  And for the UK, retaining our influence and status within NATO and amongst key allies, is another reason for getting this right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While achieving our goals in Afghanistan, British Armed Forces have been active elsewhere around the world.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Libya we fought in support of a people who wanted to be free from tyranny.  We joined allies from around the world built around a NATO core.  Together, we supplied the air force and the navy.  The people themselves were the army.  They made the change happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the seas off Somalia we are playing our part in an operation that is controlling the spread of piracy.  Alongside navies from around the world, including Pakistan, India and China, reinforcing the benefit of cooperation.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closer to home we have also been proud to play our part in HM the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.  And my fellow Chiefs and I were delighted to receive so many letters of support for the actions of our Regular and Reserve Service men and women during the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It reminded all of us in uniform of the level of support that we enjoy amongst the people of this country.  We are very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this has happened as we have been going through reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two years we have implemented some of the most radical changes to the Ministry of Defence and to the Armed Forces in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SDSR shrank the size of the Armed Forces and changed the governance of the department.  And whilst we are aware that the Autumn Statement has further implications, a balanced budget means we can start from a firm base and better demonstrate what is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new Armed Forces Committee mandates the Chiefs to resolve problems in the interests of Defence as a whole.  It exploits collective military judgment and balances single service requirements in private allowing the CDS to go to the Defence Board with the underpinning authority of a combined Joint service view.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFC, the Defence Strategy Group chaired jointly by John Thomson the PUS and me, and the new style Defence Board chaired by Philip Hammond enable the MOD to be more agile and decisive in responding at the strategic level to developing threats and trends.  The world is not a safe place.  Some threats to our interests and allies are long term but some are very present.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The immediate danger of the collapse of the Syrian regime is one.  We will support our allies in the region and would all like to see a diplomatic solution but cannot afford to remove options from the table at this stage.  Should chemical weapons be used or proliferate, both President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron have made it clear that a line would have been crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Syria is linked to Iran.  The regime is backed by Tehran so the fall of Assad’s dictatorship will impact the Iranian government.  What that means for the stability of the region is as yet unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my recent trip to the Manama Dialogue I was struck by the issues that came up.  Our host, Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, emphasised the threat of nuclear proliferation.  North Korea’s missile test last week aggravates this risk. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Kenyan and Ugandan armed forces have been exemplary in bringing order to Somalia but this has not been without cost.  Both have sustained losses, and the retaliation of terrorist groups has endangered Kampala, Nairobi and the Kenyan coast.  We must continue to support both countries, as well as the fledgling Somali government. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the west, Mali is a major cause for concern.  As still is Yemen, despite President Hadi’s laudable efforts. 
So What?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now reducing these short and long term threats, our task is to evolve a force capable of meeting, with allies, various complex tasks.  By the early 2020s, these plans result in a powerful Joint force that, on the basis of a balanced budget from Planning Round 12, should be able to meet the requirements laid on it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has not been easy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Secretary of State, building on the work of the SDSR, has ensured that the department is able to squeeze the most from the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2020 we will have kit that many of my fellow NATO Chiefs of Defence, saddled with much more sclerotic budgets than we, are envious of:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	A World Class Carrier Capability with the JSF – Lightning II – on board;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	Type 45 destroyers on patrol;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	Type 26 frigates in production;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;d.	Astute class submarines;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;e.	Chinook Mk 6 bringing the total Chinook fleet to 60;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;f.	Typhoon Tranche 3, as well as the Lightning II;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;g.	Atlas and Voyager air transport and air-to-air refuelling aircraft, underpinned by our now larger C17 fleet;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;h.	Scout vehicles, upgraded Warrior, Challenger, and Apache to give the Army better reconnaissance, mobility and firepower;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i.	Rivet Joint and other critical ISTAR platforms that will ensure we have better situational awareness than ever.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;j.	And much more emphasis on Cyber, to which I will return shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But our most decisive asset will remain our Service men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the private sector puts it, we must look after the ‘talent’. As I see equipment around the world parked with no-one to operate it. Great equipment without talented people counts for little.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We must ensure our people have the intelligence and confidence to treat the unexpected as an opportunity to exploit.  They must be capable of informed, independent action; of what has been described as a ‘brains-based approach’ to operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have all heard the common refrain that we must do more with less.  Well, to be frank, that is what we are doing.  At the strategic level, a brains-based approach means deciding to act only when we must and then doing it well, not always kinetically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of thinking has shaped the work I have started on ‘How We Will Fight’.  Assuming the approach I have just outlined, I and my fellow Chiefs have designed our forces to:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	act jointly and with allies, but able to act alone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	be well equipped, but not tied to platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	adapt as the environment changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we must prioritise.  And as spending has tightened, we must be ruthless in our requirements and getting the most from them.  Effectively targeting limited resources is, in large part, the art of military command in war and in peace through force design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new UK Joint Expeditionary Force is an expression of this.  The JEF promises much greater levels of integration than previously achieved especially when combined with others, as is already happening with our French allies in the Anglo/French Combined JEF.  The JEF must be genuinely synergistic.  It is the building block to future alliances and independent action.  And we would hope that allies such as Denmark and Estonia, who have fought with distinction in a British formation in Afghanistan, will want to play key roles within the British element of the CJEF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What it offers is clear: an integrated joint force with capabilities across the spectrum at sea, on land and in the air.  A force that can confidently be allocated a specific slice of the battle space in an allied operation or act alone.  It will be the basis of all our combined joint training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the capability to ‘punch’ hard and not be a logistical or tactical drag on a coalition, we will be especially welcomed by our friends and feared by our enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF will be of variable size; a framework into which others fit.  It will be the core of the UK’s contribution to any military action, whether NATO, coalition or independent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together with critical C2 elements such as HQ ARRC and the emphasis placed on the maritime component HQ at Northwood, the JEF is designed to meet our NATO obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Libyan campaign, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were able to play a vital role by bringing their regional expertise into the command structure of a NATO operation.  This provided greater military and political reach.  I look forward to the alliance, perhaps in part through the vehicle of the JEF, working more with non-member states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Britain’s JEF will be capable of projecting power with global effect and influence.  Nowhere is more important to us than our friends in the Middle East and Gulf and in line with clear political intent we would expect, with other initiatives, for JEF elements to spend more time reassuring and deterring in that region. 
The Royal Navy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me briefly examine how the How We Fight work affects the single services, starting with the Royal Navy.  As the Prime Minister has put it, the Navy “keeps the arteries of trade of the global economy from hardening.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy will continue to grow in importance.  As our carrier capability comes into service it will be a key part of our diplomatic, humanitarian and military strategy.  Prepared to overcome the toughest military challenges.  This is its raison d’être.  But I know it will be used for much more.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Americans demonstrated through their deployment to Aceh and Haiti that aircraft carriers have huge strategic impact supporting people around the world.  Seeing US military personnel, ships and helicopters playing such a critical role boosted the standing of the US in the world’s most populous Islamic country and undermined extremist rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hard power is an essential element of soft power.  In this respect especially, numbers, or mass, still matter.  We must resolve the conundrum at the heart of Bob Gates quip about ‘exquisite technology’.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the future, the Chief of the Naval Staff and I have a vision for a Navy which procures ships differently allowing us to have more, not fewer platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We must resist the pressure that has shrunk the number of platforms.  Clearly that will mean rethinking the Navy, including examining the case for ships that may have a limited role in general war.  But this is not new ¬¬¬– remember the corvette over the ages – and is similar to the utility of light and heavy land forces, tailored to task.  And in so doing we will ensure seamanship skills and leadership qualities, so much in demand by our friends and allies, flourish into the long term.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy’s maritime and amphibious components, with 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines at the core of the latter, will be at the heart of Britain’s JEF.  As the concept develops we will look to acquire ships that range from top-end war fighting elements through potentially to more vessels tailored to discrete but important tasks, to be deployed on a range of routine non-warfighting duties.&lt;br&gt;
The British Army&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Army too is changing.  Once we come out of the combat role in Afghanistan at the end of 2014, it will cease to be on permanent rotation with the burdens that imposes.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Army will maintain a hard power war-fighting capability while creating the strategic influence, support and engagement ability essential to modern operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the Navy, these land forces must be equipped to pack a punch but war fighting is not all they’re for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict prevention, to which I will return in a moment, is not just sensible strategy; it is a military operation requiring appropriately configured and equipped forces. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Army 2020 reforms are a fundamental re-set for the Army, making the best of a regular force a fifth smaller than when I commanded it only three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we will retain three high-readiness manoeuvre brigades, we will also have ‘adaptable brigades’ to sustain enduring operations and routinely develop partnerships and knowledge around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though more conceptual work is needed, given the importance of the region and clear Prime Ministerial intent, I envisage two or more adaptable brigades forming close tactical level relationships with particular countries in the Gulf and Jordan, for example, allowing for better cooperation with their forces.  Should the need arise for another Libya-style operation, we will be prepared.  This would greatly enhance our ability to support allies as they contain and deter threats and, with our naval presence in Bahrain, air elements in the UAE and Qatar, and traditional but potentially enhanced roles in Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, would make us a regional ally across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Africa, brigades would be tasked to support key allies in the east, west and south whilst another might be given an Indian Ocean and SE Asian focus, allowing for much greater involvement in the FPDA, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we are to influence, we must know what drives our friends and how to motivate them.  This is not something that can be done on the eve of an operation.  As these adaptable brigades develop links with countries around their region, this will create opportunities for soldiers and officers to progress their careers through linguistic and cultural specialism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defence Engagement Strategy, prepared with the Foreign Office, will provide what I have often referred to as a ‘strategic handrail’ for engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will require tough decisions.  If we are to invest properly in some relationships, others will naturally get less attention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if we get this right ¬– and we will – we will have deeper links to specific regional partners giving them the confidence to deal with their own problems and, when appropriate, to act in partnership with us.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I have described puts military flesh on the bones of welcome, NSC endorsed, national strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all comes as we are increasing the Reserves and integrating them closer with the Regular forces.  This will do more to increase our own capacity and ability to help friends and allies.
The Royal Air Force&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turning now to the Royal Air Force.  The rate of technological advance is most keenly felt on air platforms.  This is understandable.  These are complex fully networked combat and ISTAR platforms.  This intelligence cuts the time between understanding and reacting.  It allows us better to out-think and out-act our opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, lift, both tactical and global, reduces the number of reserves we need to keep, giving the Armed Forces a flexibility that was unimaginable just a few decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding and exploiting the opportunities technology presents will be decisive in maintaining our advantage – in sufficient numbers – into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remotely piloted air systems and novel anti-air defences have changed our understanding of both what it means to fight and defend.  We must not allow sacred cows – such as the indispensability of on-board pilots – to rule the day.  The Chief of the Air Staff is leading the change.  By giving ‘wings’ to UAV pilots the Royal Air Force is recognising the capability of the platform and skill of the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is a reflection of how early we are in this process of transition that we still refer to remotely-piloted air systems or unmanned aerial vehicles.  How long was it before we stopped referring to the horseless carriage?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all three Services, their role within an integrated CJEF will be the driving force in their force development and training.  Whoever the enemy, wherever the threat, we will need partners.  Building them now is an investment in our own future and our capacity to succeed quickly should war break out.
Cyber&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is a new environment within which we must learn to manoeuvre with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today Facebook, with around a billion users, is the third most populous country in the world.  It exemplifies one of the most extreme changes we have seen in the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyberspace is the nervous system of our global economy.  We are reliant on the internet and other networked systems for every aspect of our lives.  It allows bewildering speed of action and global reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, just as crime has become e-crime, spying has increasingly become cyber espionage.  We have seen nations, their proxies and non-state actors use this new space for terrorism and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though not conventional assaults, the hostile cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008 and Burma in 2010 were damaging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, there have been unprecedented levels of cyber attack over the past 24 months.  Israel has reported over 44 million attempts to disrupt its government websites during recent tension around the Gaza strip.  STUXNET demonstrated a new class of threat aimed at process control systems at the heart of modern infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without doubt, actions in cyberspace will form part of any future conflict.  Communication and the control of infrastructure and systems has become a new environment through which combatants will further their objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our immediate priority must be to ensure our networks are secure and defensible, working with partners in industry and around the country to drive up standards and ensure we have robust protocols in place.  This builds on the excellent work done under the National Cyber Security Strategy but Defence has particular challenges as a department, as Armed Forces and through the contractors and partners with whom we work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am determined that the Armed Forces should understand cyberspace, and how it will shape future conflict, as instinctively as we understand maritime, land and air operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will mean changes in the way we operate: new doctrine; new capabilities; new structures, with Joint Forces Command at their heart.
It will mean a new approach to growing and developing the talent we need to operate in this new, electronic, environment.  Like our Secretary of State, I see an important role for reserves in this domain. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id="winding-up"&gt;Winding Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In examining each environment separately I hope I have highlighted some of the key issues on the Chiefs’ plate and how we must respond to them.  But the most important is developing an integrated Joint model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF is neither the 1980s Canadian model nor, whilst there are some apparent similarities, is it a British version of the US Marine Corps.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the UK armed forces relies heavily on the different skill-sets and ethos of each single Service.  Each adapted for its environment, and evolving as times and technology change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a joint conceptual approach, based on lessons from the real world, embedded through force development, in training, on operations and though the cohering glue of modern C3I and cyber is vital to delivering the military capability the nation requires.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is about ensuring single Service skills meld into joint action so that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF won’t mean we can do more with less; it will mean, through the synergy it provides, that we get the most from what we have.  And doubtless there will be some roles that we continue to leave to others, notably the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I close let me draw some lessons from my 41 years in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some constants which may seem obvious in this room but are often over looked:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a.	The need for military force to influence, secure and protect is as great as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b.	I joined an Army that was geared to defend Britain by fighting in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;c.	Today life is more complex but the principle is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;d.	9/11, and the 7/7 bombings in London show that we cannot choose our battlefields as we once did.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;e.	The world is not a safer place and the distinction between home and abroad is strategically obsolete.  Today it is part of a continuum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We cannot just stand by and hope we are ignored and danger passes us by.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Foreign Secretary said in September last year: “the country that is purely reactive in foreign affairs is in decline”. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responses may be based on either soft or hard power, but to divorce the two is strategic blindness.  Soft power is not a substitute for strength.  On the contrary, it is often based on the credible threat of force, either to support a friend or deter an enemy.  Hard power and soft power are intertwined.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not enough to provide aid or speak kindly.  Our friends want to know we are there when it counts, not just fair-weather friends.  This is the confidence hard power brings.  It drives equipment sales and thus industrial growth, as well as diplomatic treaties, just as it has for centuries.  But hard power also does more than this: it dissuades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterrence doctrine has fallen out of fashion so perhaps you will allow me to recall some of the elements.  Sun Tzu’s famous maxim is: “Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too often this is seen as clever posturing on the eve of battle.  It is not.  Training, equipping and partnering with allies enhance the aura of British power.  They give us presence on the world stage and ensure that we are not tested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth being clear: when the Armed Forces train we do not just do it to be ready, we do it to be seen to be ready.  When we succeed on operations, we do not just win a battle.  We prove that we can win a war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a very real sense, everything the Armed Forces do deters and reassures.  With enough numbers, enough equipment and with good leaders at every level, Britain is a credible threat to our enemies and a reassuring friend to our allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is cheaper than fighting and more credible than talk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading the record of how the Soviets saw the Falklands War demonstrates this admirably.  What many saw as post-colonial folie de grandeur, the Soviet leadership, rightly, saw as proof that the British Armed Forces were united with their government and people – Clausewitz’s famous trilogy – and more than a match for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was far from the only factor, but the increase in Soviet defence spending in the 1980s which ended up contributing to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact was partly due to clarity of their failure to impose their will in neighbouring, occupied countries while Britain could liberate territory some 8,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Chief of the Defence Staff I do not wear the burdens of office any more lightly than my predecessors.  I have set out some of my concerns for the coming years and some of the ways we will think and act to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the Prime Minister’s chairmanship, The National Security Council, on which I am privileged to sit, considers all the big strategic issues that I have listed and more.  It is a hugely welcome addition to Whitehall, directing and bringing clarity to national strategy and coordinating cross-government action. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the nature of the world is such that what will later seem obvious, today is opaque and unpredictable.  How will Europe emerge from the Euro crisis?  How will the Arab Spring conclude?  How will global warming affect water supplies?  And what of cyber?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, grand strategy, while providing a guide to action in peacetime, is also about being prepared and balanced for what we can never know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring we have enough left in the bag while actively deterring, and when required defeating, aggression against us and our friends, enough left to succeed against those ‘unknown unknowns’, is ultimately what I and my fellow Chiefs are paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;END&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Christmas message from the Defence Secretary</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full text of the message is reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 has been a busy and challenging year for Defence - on operations in Afghanistan, on our many other overseas commitments, and here at home, delivering security for the Olympics and beginning the huge process of Defence Transformation. You should be proud of what you have achieved in the last 12 months - military and civilian personnel working together to protect our security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, 20th Armoured Brigade, 12th Mechanized Brigade, and now 4th Mechanized Brigade, have built on the hard work and sacrifice of their predecessors. This has been another tough year in Helmand province and we should remember, in particular, the members of our Armed Forces who have lost their lives or who have been seriously injured. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten. However, we should be in no doubt about the importance of the mission or the significant progress that we are making with our &lt;abbr title="International Security Assistance Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/abbr&gt; (International Security Assistance Force) partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Security Forces"&gt;ANSF&lt;/abbr&gt; (Afghan National Security Forces) take on ever more responsibility for security, we will be able to make further significant reduction in UK troop numbers in theatre next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, this summer, at short notice, you stepped in to undertake the largest peacetime operation since World War II, helping to make the Olympic and Paralympic Games such a resounding success, and in the process you demonstrated to the British public and visitors from across the world that your reputation for the highest standards of professionalism is well deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our main effort has been on operations, we have also continued the vital task of transforming Defence to ensure that we have the people, equipment and training to maintain our battle-winning edge in the post-Afghanistan security environment. A balanced budget is the foundation upon which this rests and we must continue to ensure that we maintain our budget discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I know that achieving that balanced budget, and in particular reducing the number of military and civilian personnel, has been a painful process for many. I also recognise that there is a need for certainty over the future laydown of the Armed Forces and the structure of DE&amp;amp;S (Defence Equipment and Support). These are both complex tasks, but I will announce the outcomes and provide that certainty as soon as I can next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we undertake this process of transformation, it is important to keep in mind what we are aiming for: the most capable, deployable and best-trained armed forces in the world, supported by a lean, efficient MOD and a procurement operation that delivers the maximum effect for every pound of taxpayers’ money. There is still a long way to go to deliver this, but I want everyone, whether military or civilian, to be proud of what we are achieving in Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to thank you all for the hard work, commitment and professionalism you have shown in 2012. I am proud to lead such a capable team of men and women. To those of you spending Christmas away from home, you will be in our thoughts. For those of you not on operations, I hope you enjoy the Christmas break. Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Right Honourable Philip Hammond MP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Meet more Millies heroes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="judges-special-recognition-award-1---operation-olympics"&gt;Judges’ Special Recognition Award 1 - Operation Olympics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympians Victoria Pendleton and Greg Rutherford presented the first of two Judges’ Special Recognition Awards to the Armed Forces for their contribution to the London 2012 Olympics. At its height, more than 17,500 personnel stepped in when G4S were not able to provide sufficient guards for all the venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone I’ve met has been incredible; individuals who’ve achieved so much. I feel in awe because all I did was ride round in circles on a wooden track with a bike with no brakes and one gear and this is real life. I can’t not be moved and it makes me feel very proud to be British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear the military personnel treasured their experiences. Senior Aircraftwoman Afyah Bubb, an RAF medic who volunteered to be part of the security team at the Olympic Park, saw it as a ‘once-in-a-lifetime opportunity’. She said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were there to do a job but I unexpectedly got the chance to see Ellie Simmonds break some swimming records which was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Brian Fahy added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were really proud to be part of the Games this summer and see the superb performance of our athletes. Who wouldn’t want to be part of the greatest show in town?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olympic long jump gold medallist Greg Rutherford said backstage: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m hugely proud of the Armed Forces; the whole evening has been a massive highlight and getting involved feels out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anne Brannagan and members of the Headley Court Complex Trauma Team" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5637/award_for_headley_court.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Anne Brannagan and members of the Headley Court Complex Trauma Team with their Special Recognition Award [Picture: The Sun newspaper]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a light-hearted moment, Greg joked that he hadn’t packed enough tissues. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I get emotional so easily and seeing videos of these incredible people moves me to tears every time. It’s completely surreal to be here; I’ve got friends in the Armed Forces including my best friend who is now going through training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s fantastic to be invited to such a prestigious night, and to show our respect and thanks to these guys is an honour. The troops came in with happy smiley faces and gave high fives and absolutely saved the day! A huge thank you, you were absolutely spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="judges-special-recognition-award-2---complex-trauma-team-headley-court"&gt;Judges’ Special Recognition Award 2 - Complex Trauma Team, Headley Court&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Judges’ Special Recognition Award honoured the Complex Trauma Team at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Militarymedicine/Pages/HeadleyCourt.aspx" title="Headley Court"&gt;Headley Court&lt;/a&gt;. It is the remarkable skill and dedication of the 110-strong Trauma Team that help many critically wounded soldiers overcome life-changing injuries so they can get back to leading active lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex trauma manager Anne Brannagan received the award on behalf of Headley Court from actor Kevin Spacey who congratulated and shook hands with each of the 10 team members on stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Captain Clare Walton, Commanding Officer at Headley Court, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kevin Spacey was just very complimentary, it was great, and to have someone of his level of superstardom even know who we are is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/4685336/the-sun-military-awards-2012-roll-of-honour.html" title="Sun Military Awards roll of honour"&gt;The Millies&lt;/a&gt; awards ceremony tonight (14 December) on ITV1 at 2100hrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Living through the guilt of surviving</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rifle muzzle protruded from his chest, piercing just millimetres above the main artery going into his heart, his radio had gone through his arm, and the explosion had fired shrapnel, gravel and metal the length of his back to the soles of his feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His legs burned from the fierce heat of the metal fragments piercing his skin, his trousers were all but gone - shredded in the blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his own injuries, he tried to help carry the other wounded from the ensuing fire fight, instinctively pulling the rifle muzzle from his chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/mental-health-support-for-the-uk-armed-forces"&gt;Mental health support for the UK Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years on and Guardsman Pearson’s body remains scarred, with shrapnel still coming out of his skin every day. The hidden mental scars, however, have damaged him more than any physical injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Torturing myself’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having had both types of injuries, physical and mental, the physical side of it was far easier to get over,” said the 21-year-old Grenadier Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The mental side of it, well it’s just taking so long to get over. You finally think you are there and then one little thing happens and it all comes back down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="British soldiers carrying a simulated casualty during an exercise in Wales (stock image)" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5618/Living_through_the_guilt_of_surviving_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;British soldiers carrying a simulated casualty during an exercise in Wales (stock image) [Picture: Corporal Paul Morrison, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest thing to deal with has been the reaction of people he had considered friends - their ignorance of post-traumatic stress disorder leading them to think he was faking flashbacks, nightmares and crippling insomnia to get out of soldiering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The things people have said about me since admitting my post-traumatic stress are, to be fair, what I would have thought about anyone else too… before it happened to me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone says just man up, and that’s what I had been doing for so long, but it came to a point where I couldn’t man up any more. I had to go get help to get through it because it was only going to get worse, not better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was short-tempered and angry, drinking too much and arguing, and I was having difficulty sleeping. I was getting paranoid about sleeping in the same room as the other blokes in case they took the mick out of me for screaming in the night from the nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was torturing myself with ‘what ifs’, and if that had happened what would have come out of it. But I still thought there was nothing wrong with me, that it was everyone else and they just hadn’t adapted to me coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My now wife, Loren, begged me to realise what I was doing, and how hard I was making other people’s lives with my arguing. It would be over the stupidest little things. But I thought it was everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk through the explosion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turning point came when Guardsman Pearson reacted badly to a joke made at a family wedding, and Loren’s father took him outside for a little chat, warning him that if he continued he would lose Loren and destroy everything he had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I went to the med centre as soon as I got back to work,” he said. “I didn’t want to hurt anyone, and I was starting to worry about how much of a hold I had over myself during the flashbacks and the drinking. I didn’t know what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after reporting to the medical centre, Guardsman Pearson was referred to the Department of Community Mental Health in Woolwich for assessment and then psychotherapy, and was encouraged to talk through the explosion in Nad ‘Ali - breaking it down into little bits to look at each action from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this he could slowly see that he had done nothing wrong, and that nothing he could have done would have saved his friend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I first went to the sessions my intention was just to forget everything, I didn’t want to relive it,” he said. “I wanted everything out of my mind so I could finally get a decent night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We tried things like the breathing techniques to deal with my anger, but it just didn’t work with me - it’s easier said than done to sit there and think of a happy place when all you want to do is be angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But breaking things down and looking at it from different ways did make me feel better as I could see I did what any normal soldier would have done in the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More good days than bad days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time. There is no quick fix. It’s been nearly two years for me now, and it’s a constant cycle of good and bad days. It feels like you are stuck and you can’t go that little bit further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Initially though it was like a roundabout - sometimes I would go to the therapist and there would be absolutely nothing wrong and it would all be fine, and then a week later I would go back and there would be loads I needed to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now the memories only tend to come back on days like Remembrance Sunday, whereas before it was every night and I would remember that little bit more than I did the night before - so it would play on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I still have my good days and my bad days, but now it’s more good days than bad days. And when my mood swings Loren will tell me to stop me going into them so much. She knows the signs when I am starting to go downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest thing for me is being back at work though - it keeps you busy and your mind off other things. I just hope others will be able to make the most of my experiences to go and seek help, and this campaign [Don’t Bottle It Up] will change the way people think about mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Light Dragoons step up mentoring in Helmand</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boasting a proud recent history as a distinguished reconnaissance regiment, the Light Dragoons have trained diligently for another tour on the outer extremes of Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working remotely has become a reality for elements of the Norfolk-based unit on Op HERRICK 16, others have seen their job description change significantly after less than two months in theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having deployed to southern Afghanistan in a formation reconnaissance role, personnel from A Squadron are now playing their part in the continuing transition effort after accepting a new tasking within the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the move and how they are preparing for the challenge that lies ahead, on the eve of their training in Camp Bastion Lieutenant Jamie Harle said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was very much last minute but we are eager for it. I deployed on my last HERRICK in 2006 and that was all kinetic, but anyone thinking this tour would be the same is misguided. This is all about transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Afghans we have spoken to are really proud of what they are doing; they want to return security to their family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were undertaking screening tasks in the desert, identifying areas of population and routes, while providing a visible deterrent. It was very successful but the main effort has switched for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are now focusing on expanding the mentoring side so the locals can look after these routes and population centres themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Op HERRICK 16 is the third Afghan deployment for Corporal Scott Mallen and the junior non-commissioned officer thinks the timescale for transition is achievable after witnessing the progress that has already been made.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Life on the ground for soldiers of the Light Dragoons is very different to previous tours [Picture: Graeme Main, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the situation on the ground changing, he believes A Squadron can add to the success in its new role training the Afghan Police:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From what I have seen everything is shaping up for the handover,” he said. “It has quietened down in terms of kinetic activity and that is one of the main reasons why forward reconnaissance is coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day the Afghans want a better life. The country’s army is up and running and the ANP [Afghan National Police] are now manning checkpoints in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Op HERRICK 5 it was really kicking off and we were the Brigade Reconnaissance Force on Op HERRICK 10. That was lethal and everyone had a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fact it is now quieter shows we are doing a job out here. The ANP are performing their role and they are not afraid to have a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these soldiers are relishing the opportunity of testing themselves in a new environment, the remainder of the squadron will continue with their formation reconnaissance day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief has seen them providing overwatch for ground forces, pushing forward on scouting missions and playing a key role in identifying enemy positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers of 3rd Troop at Forward Operating Base Ouellette have discovered that life on the ground is very different to previous tours:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was here on Op HERRICK 10 and it was kinetic every day, but now it is quieter and the enemy are on the back foot,” explained Trooper Neil Nutton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Babaji was a Taliban stronghold; we took that and I think it has broken them. We are getting tighter and tighter on them and all they can do is ‘shoot and scoot’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating in Helmand province has become a family affair for the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His brother Trooper Anthony Nutton is serving with B Squadron of the Light Dragoons as part of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force, while older sibling Rifleman John Nutton, 2nd Battalion The Rifles, deployed on Op HERRICK 15:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I met John in Camp Bastion and he said hardly anything happened during his tour. He only had a few contacts and did a lot of patrolling with the ANP, “ said Trooper Neil Hutton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I thought that couldn’t be right, but I believe it now, it has been quiet. In the formation reconnaissance squadron our main role is to go out and see what the enemy are doing, to see where they are and where the IEDs may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can do that for a couple of weeks if needed - it is about building the picture and getting information ahead of any operations. We are the eyes and ears of the battle group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as taking the fight to the enemy, the tour has reaffirmed the positive role being played by the Army within Afghan communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attached medic Lance Corporal Lee Robson, Royal Army Medical Corps, was delighted to report that he has seen a distinct lack of British casualties in the area thus far, meaning his attention has been focused elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have been hands-on with the locals, treating children and adults for minor ailments through to serious injuries such as broken ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a medic it is always nice to offer help to anyone, especially if they have no healthcare system of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It all goes back to the hearts and minds mantra. We are showing them that we are not a force to be frightened of - we are here to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers from A Squadron have again proved how the British Army is producing personnel that can adapt to a variety of roles in the heat of Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with transition set for 2014, the efforts of these troops over the coming months will go a long way to ensuring this ambition becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
