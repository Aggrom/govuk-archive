    <title>UK forces' contribution to Libya campaign</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a media briefing held earlier today, 27 October, in the Ministry of Defence Main Building, Air Marshal Peach began with a brief narrative of the operation recalling that, in February, as a result of the deterioration of the situation in Libya, there was quite a lot of work for Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) to do in terms of getting entitled persons out of the country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to say about that is to say thank you to the government and the people of Malta for letting us form a base there. In terms of geography, that gave us a special advantage to deal with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PJHQ, under the Air Marshal’s command, is a high-readiness group of people, ready to deploy rapidly around the world when something happens. In this case, they formed a non-combatant evacuation coordination cell, and by doing this avoided the situation where potentially three different countries could have sent three different aircraft in a disorganised way to pick up the same group of people: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a very soft attempt to coordinate across a group of nations who were all trying to do the same thing,” said the Air Marshal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was very successful. It was quite a tough call. We took a risk on the Sunday in particular, when we went deep with a C-130 into the desert. It was uncertain because of the number and nationality of the people there kept fluctuating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the same objective, Type 22 frigate HMS Cumberland was then moved into Benghazi harbour, which the Air Marshal also described as very uncertain at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it was a very successful part of the story, we evacuated 1,400 people out of a total of 4,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An added advantage gained from this operation, known as Op DEFERENCE, was that it built up knowledge of the country and provoked some thinking about what might happen next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were a bit surprised at how quickly things moved on,” said the Air Marshal. “We had the USCR 97 at the end of February, the National Transition Council established 5 March and then the no-fly zone was established. In quick time, some very successful operations were developed leading up to the hand over to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost a maritime embargo was established in which the Royal Navy played a key role with a number of ships and people who understood very well command and control in these situations and how to do boarding and embargo operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The influence of UK officers and men and women in command and control throughout this operation is something we should pay tribute to,” said Air Marshal Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A no-fly zone was quickly established. Having been personally involved in four of these in previous times, the Air Marshal said that, “we know how to do that.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO then took over, naming the operation ‘UNIFIED PROTECTOR’, and set up its HQ in Naples, a traditional NATO control centre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the important features of this operation is the harmony and the importance of the role of Italy,” said Air Marshal Peach, “harmony because the Italian military authorities have been extremely good hosts for the UK, and the importance of the geography is pretty obvious. The amount of support they gave us, bases, fuel, logistics, command and control was and is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In supporting civilians who were being “quite aggressively killed by the Libyan forces,” Air Marshal Peach said that what he wanted to highlight above all was the importance of the precise application of force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We judged, and I continue to judge, that unnecessary damage, or worse, the causing of civilian casualties would be a strategic liability for the campaign. The discipline of the ship, aircraft and helicopter crews are something I want to record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with NATO partners, Apache attack helicopters were introduced, mounted from HMS Ocean, to provide a useful tactical capability and, at the request of the NTC special advisers, “not Special Forces,” were introduced and who played a useful role in supporting the NTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key military objective at this point in addition to protecting civilians from pro-Gaddafi forces was reducing the command and control of the regime to stop the attack on their own people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what was going on inside Libya was a key task throughout, not just along the coastal strip but deep inside the country as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also had some unusual tasks,” said Air Marshal Peach, “which I would not have predicted - for example, guarding Libyan dinars contained in a RAF C17 flown into Benghazi to get the money flowing; done, for obvious reasons, in complete secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Army Air Corps Apache and United States Air Force HH60 helicopters on board HMS Ocean, supporting Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR in the Mediterranean " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5335/UK_forces__contribution_to_Libya_campaign-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Army Air Corps Apache and United States Air Force HH60 helicopters on board HMS Ocean, supporting Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR in the Mediterranean  [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Guy Pool, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Gaddafi regime fell back on traditional homeland areas the fighting in and around Sirte was very difficult as the need for the disciplined application of force was more important than ever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point after all this investment of effort, we were not going to spoil it by being wanton in the application of force. So a number of times we held back, we held off, we made sure that the rules of engagement were strictly followed,” said Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have now reached the point where we are continuing to support operations awaiting direction from the North Atlantic Council, which we expect in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes and lessons that have been identified by PJHQ include precision in the use of weapons which has been, the Air Marshal felt, world class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The accuracy, the consistency, and the predictions of the serviceability of our weapons has been confounded. The British weapons in particular have been world class. The low collateral damage of Brimstone is at the top end of anybody’s inventory in the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this precision, the Air Marshal argued, was not just because the bombs were good, but because of the ways in which the ships crews and the air crews are using and interpreting the rules of engagement, using their weapons in a disciplined way, guided by the AWACS aircrews operating 24-hours-a-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The helicopters that deployed provided the ability to go as deep as 50 miles (80km) inland against a series of military targets. Video footage shows a crew taking out a target with two hellfire missiles; the second being fired and destroying the vehicle after those on the ground had been given time to flee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At no point,” said the Air Marshal, “have British servicemen targeted individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tornados carried British-designed and British-built Brimstone missiles, which proved to be a world class weapon system. The Tornado, although undeniably an old platform, is bang up to date in terms of what’s going on inside the cockpit as far as control software, intelligence and reconnaissance is concerned, the Air Marshal said, and he also praised the ground crews who worked round the clock to make sure the aircraft kept flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a new aircraft is the Typhoon, and the Air Marshal said the aircraft had been adapted to carry weapons such as laser-guided bombs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained that the complimentary way Typhoons worked alongside the Tornados, using their targeting pods to create additional intelligence and reconnaissance, was very important: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Typhoon has been a great success on this operation,” he said. “We have also been very pleased with the way that the Army Air Corps adapted to life on the ocean wave aboard HMS Ocean; a first for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Marshall Peach closed by saying that the UK did not do all this alone, and that the success of the operation had depended on the input of 19 partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-forces-transfer-responsibility-for-security-in-sangin-to-us"/>
    <title>UK forces transfer responsibility for security in Sangin to US</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transfer of authority, first announced by the Defence Secretary in July this year, is the last move in the current rebalancing of ISAF forces across Helmand. It follows an increase in ISAF and Afghan security forces in Helmand over recent months and will ensure an equal distribution of ISAF forces amongst the Afghan population living there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handing over Sangin will allow UK forces to focus their effort in central Helmand where they will continue to deliver effective counter-insurgency operations, working alongside the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces have been in Sangin, a key economic and transport hub, since 2006. Alongside the ANSF, they have provided vital security for the local population on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan, enabling development and preventing the insurgency from using Sangin as a base from which to mount attacks across Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 Commando Royal Marines, currently deployed with 4th Mechanized Brigade, have handed over to the US Marine Corps (USMC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British forces have served in Sangin over the last four years and should be very proud of the achievements they have made in one of the most challenging areas of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The level of sacrifice has been high and we should never forget the many brave troops who have lost their lives in the pursuit of success in an international mission rooted firmly in our own national security in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The handover of Sangin by UK forces represents sound military rationale and reflects the increase of both ISAF and Afghan forces across Helmand over the course of the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops will redeploy to central Helmand in support of ISAF’s main effort, where they will continue to lead the fight against the insurgency and assist in building a stable and secure Afghanistan that can stand on its own two feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Gordon Messenger, the Chief of the Defence Staff’s Strategic Communications Officer, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops redeploying from Sangin are handing over a strong, forward-looking operation which has, over the last four years, ensured that the authority of the Afghan Government exists even in an area that the Taliban regard as their heartland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our troops operating in Sangin have been taking the fight to the Taliban and by doing so have reduced the threat of violence spreading elsewhere. The progress and momentum in central Helmand would not have been possible without their endeavour and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is and will continue to be a challenging area because of its strategic importance to the Afghan Government, ISAF and the insurgency - that is why ISAF forces will remain there to build upon the progress already achieved by UK forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A member of the Police Mentoring Troop during a routine patrol around Sangin's bazaar " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5333/UK_forces_transfer_responsibility_for_security_in_Sangin_to_US-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A member of the Police Mentoring Troop during a routine patrol around Sangin's bazaar  [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Si Ethell, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The transfer of responsibility for Sangin to the USMC is the latest in a series of practical and sensible reconfigurations that have occurred as a result of the significant uplift in ISAF troops in Helmand over the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It allows British forces, with their Danish and Estonian allies, to focus their efforts in the critical central Helmand area, building on the strong momentum that has already been achieved there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Richard Mills, Commander of Regional Command (South West), the military headquarters responsible for Helmand and Nimruz provinces, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UK forces have carved out a solid security bubble that we are moving US forces into. They are leaving solid professional relationships with the people and the ANSF in Sangin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will continue to build on the successes and continue to work with the local population and forces there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being an economic and transport hub, power lines route through Sangin, supplying power from the Kajaki hydroelectric station to central Helmand and Kandahar, and Sangin is one of the most fertile areas in Helmand. Building and maintaining security and governance in Sangin is therefore vital for the long-term stability and development of Helmand and the wider region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sangin has moved forward since 2006 with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the reform of Sangin’s district governance with a new District Governor and senior staff appointed in March 2010. The new Governor is actively working with members of the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team and local community leaders to improve governance in Sangin and win the support of local tribal groupings, some of whom have previously supported the insurgency;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• over 850 shops trading in Sangin’s bazaar, twice as many as summer last year; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the improvement of Route 611 from central Helmand through Sangin to Kajaki - increasing access to agricultural land and markets for local people; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• local administrators, supported by the Provincial Reconstruction Team, working to distribute grain and promote the production of legal alternatives to narcotics; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• trained Afghan medics at the new health clinic, which opened in October 2009, treating 300 patients per week - men, women and children from Sangin and its surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, Commanding Officer of 40 Commando Royal Marines, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s been a hard fight for 40 Commando Royal Marines in Sangin, but we have achieved much. We have sought to protect the local people and have worked hard to support the Afghan National Security Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our partners in the ANA and ANP [Afghan National Police] have improved tremendously. They have provided the security for the District Governor to spread the influence of the Afghan Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bazaar itself, central to the economy of the area, is thriving and a much more bustling place than when we arrived with new shops opening all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is still work to do, and we are confident that our American partners will build on what we have achieved. We have lost brave Marines, but we will do them proud and return home with our heads held high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces will redeploy to central Helmand where they will join their British colleagues who are operating alongside Afghan and other ISAF forces and where the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team is carrying out major governance and socio-economic development projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Governor of Sangin, Mohammad Sharif, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The attitude, service and sacrifice that has been paid by the Royal Marines has been exemplary and has set a very good example for the people of Sangin. As 40 Commando goes, they will be missed by the people of Sangin and they will be in our thoughts and minds forever as we will always remember their hard work and efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces support Afghan operation in Lower Gereshk Valley</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operation BIG FISH was planned at a meeting of Afghan security officials including the District Governor and the Chief of Police, which was attended by the Commander of Task Force Helmand, Brigadier Doug Chalmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security shura meets regularly to discuss the district’s security priorities and the allocation of police and army resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Rupert King-Evans, Fire Support Company Commander, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operation was to clear insurgents, IED components and IED-making facilities from the Lower Gereshk Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key point from this operation is that it was an Afghan operation supported by ISAF, and not the other way around. The Afghans planned the operation. We offered advice and, when they requested, we provided support for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task fell to the Afghan National Army (ANA) 3/215 Brigade, led by Brigadier General Sherin Shah. At dawn on the day of the operation, more than 400 Afghan warriors from the brigade flew into the contested area. By conducting several ‘dummy’ landings at various locations, the insurgents were kept on the back foot, and the Afghan forces achieved the element of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan warriors, accompanied by their British advisors, patrolled up the valley, clearing the area of insurgents and searching compounds for weapons and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Major Nathan Love from a Kandak Advisory Training Team said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sheer mass of Afghan force on the ground was enough to deter the enemy and show the people that the Afghans are leading. The Taliban saw this and most of them decided not to fight, so the ANA were able to find 14 of their IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Afghan warrior sweeps for explosive devices during Operation BIG FISH" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5331/UK_forces_support_Afghan_operation_in_Lower_Gereshk_Valley-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An Afghan warrior sweeps for explosive devices during Operation BIG FISH  [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Afghan soldiers searching the area and keeping the local residents safe, it was a point of pride to be leading a major operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jawid Afghanyar, an ANA officer with the 6th Kandak, 3/215 Brigade, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have mine-defusing teams, infantry teams and many others bringing security and peace to the area. It has been a while since the Afghan National Security Forces have been in the area and the people now know that we will help make this area safe and secure, so the people here can continue their work in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British soldiers involved in mentoring the Afghan forces have seen them rise to a very high level of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major King-Evans concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s seriously impressive how well the Afghan Army is operating. They are really swept up. Their low-level tactics, skills and drills are excellent, and they conducted the operation almost as if they were ISAF themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They’ve shown the local population that the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan National Army and Police are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces praised as new command stands up in South West Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes, announced on 21 May, see Regional Command (South West), based in Helmand, overseeing Helmand and Nimruz provinces, while Regional Command (South) [RC(S)], headquartered in Kandahar, continues to control ISAF forces in Kandahar, Daykundi, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the majority of ISAF forces based in southern Afghanistan, the formation of the new headquarters permits commanders in the south to focus on geographically smaller areas, ensure greater partnering between the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and ISAF, and deliver the levels of security required for governance and development to continue to spread in the region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Richard Mills of the United States Marine Corps is in charge of the new Command. He leads a combined force of some 27,000 personnel, with units drawn from eight nations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a distinct privilege for all of us to stand up Regional Command (South West),” he said. “We are truly building on the outstanding work of all that have served here in Helmand and Nimruz provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The establishment of Regional Command (South West) is a natural military progression based on the number of troops serving here and the priority placed on Helmand and Nimruz provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the first time that the US Marine Corps has led an ISAF Regional Command. The British officers serving in my coalition headquarters as well as Task Force Helmand have brought invaluable experience and knowledge to the command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are partnered with ANSF at all levels and conducting joint operations throughout Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tough fighting remains,” he added, “but I see evidence daily of progress that will bring about lasting stability across southern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will be a significant year for the future of Afghanistan. Coalition forces, alongside our Afghan counterparts, will continue to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as it delivers legitimate governance, improved security and lasting economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant General David Rodriguez, Commander of ISAF Joint Command, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The establishment of Regional Command (South West) significantly increases the ability of the Afghan National Security Forces to partner with the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Mills praised the work of British forces in Helmand province:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I remain very much impressed by the momentum and achievements of RC(S) under General Carter,” he said. “My predecessors in the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the British troops of Task Force Helmand have distinguished themselves in the service of the Afghan people here. Because of their efforts, real and tangible progress is being made here every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional Command (South), led by Major General Nick Carter, will continue to direct ISAF operations in the provinces of Kandahar, Zabul, Uruzgan and Daykundi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 30,000 troops continue to operate in RC(S). No troops have been realigned during the formation of the new command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces killed in 2009 remembered at National Memorial Arboretum</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex and Defence Minister Andrew Robathan attended the service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service was led by Bishop John Kirkham and attended by more than 500 family members who walked solemnly past the names of the fallen engraved in the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing those gathered, the Venerable Ray Pentland QHC, Chaplain-in-Chief at the Royal Air Force, described the process of remembrance as ‘very precious and special’, adding that it ‘helps to give us a foundation’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2009 saw the largest number of UK Armed Forces deaths in the last twenty years and the highest number of Army deaths since the Falklands conflict in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces Memorial, dedicated in the presence of Her Majesty The Queen in 2007, is the UK’s tribute to the 16,000 men and women who have been killed on duty or as a result of terrorist action since 1948.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memorial has space for 15,000 further names and one of its most poignant features until now was its remaining blank wall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the number of deaths in 2009, it has been necessary to commence engraving on this wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today is an important day for the country to recognise those that made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma-Jane Webster, whose fiance, Lance Corporal Richard Brandon, was killed in Afghanistan in September, said the memorial was ‘absolutely spectacular’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s wonderful recognition for what he did and what he believed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces help transform Helmand hospital</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than twelve months ago Gereshk District Hospital was in a poor state; all of the buildings were in need of urgent repair, there were no inpatients, the incinerator was broken, and medical waste littered the hospital grounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), working with a Military Stabilisation Support Team (MSST), has completed 23 renovation projects at the site in Nahr-e Saraj (North).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hospital is now one of the leading medical facilities in Helmand, able to provide treatment to a much larger number of patients from Now Zad and Sangin - more than 20km away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renovated hospital has a 24-hour accident and emergency ward, a maternity wing, and vaccination and dental clinics, as well as a drop-in service for more common ailments. All the services are free to patients thanks to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and non-governmental agencies, who manage the funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Abdul Latif is the Director of Health in Gereshk and has worked at the hospital for the last six years. He has worked closely with the MSST, PRT and GIRoA, and has been the driving force behind the renovation. All of the work has been carried out by Afghan contractors using local materials, and this has helped to boost the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Air Force Sergeant Karen Swallow is from the MSST, part of Task Force Helmand. She says the most significant change at the hospital has been in the maternity facilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Previously the maternity ward was what can only be described as a broom cupboard with two old beds side-by-side. Now, it’s a completely new building with up-to-date facilities giving privacy and respect to the women before, during and after their labour,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="nside the new maternity wing at Gereshk District Hospital " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5326/UK_forces_help_transform_Helmand_hospital-05.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;nside the new maternity wing at Gereshk District Hospital  [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Hamish Burke, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif says as a result they’re seeing more and more mothers at the hospital:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most women give birth at home, but now the new maternity wing offers an ante and postnatal care facility, waiting rooms and bathrooms, and we have three female midwives and one female nurse working at the hospital,” he explained. “Increasingly, more women are taking advantage of the improved medical care rather than risking having their babies at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only the medical facilities that have been upgraded. A new incinerator, designed and built by an Afghan contractor, has been put in place so surgical rubbish is no longer left lying around, posing a health risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen, which previously had no electricity and little equipment, now has lights and utensils, allowing the chef to prepare and store food for inpatients and staff. A new well has also been installed, along with a parking area, a mortuary, a new footpath and repairs to the boundary wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrant Officer Class 2 (Artificer Quarter Master Sergeant) Mike Wright from the MSST said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything has been completed to a high standard by the local contractors, providing a much needed improvement to services for the people of Gereshk. Without the dedication of the staff here to their hospital, the projects there would not have been such a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those treated at the hospital include victims of road traffic accidents, gunshot wounds and mine injuries from either insurgent-laid improvised explosive devices or legacy munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding and better facilities mean that the medical care is no longer constrained to the hospital. Various outreach programmes are also run by the medical teams to ensure that provision is extended to the more rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every day nurses from our hospital travel out into the district taking vaccines and health supplies to those who are unable to reach us. These health workers also spread information about basic hygiene and how important it is. The advice spread by word of mouth reaches far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif and the staff are keen to further expand the hospital and provide even better access to facilities for the local people. Sergeant Swallow is confident this will be achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This project has been the greatest success project which I have been involved in during my time with the MSST,” she said. “Dr Latif and his staff are fully committed to making further changes to the hospital, improving its service in the future. It is obvious that this facility will be sustained well after ISAF troops have vacated Afghanistan, which makes it the success story it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK commits more troops to Balkans peacekeeping mission</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company of soldiers will be based in the UK, ready to deploy at short notice to the region if required as part of EUFOR (European Union Force) Operation ALTHEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation ALTHEA has the backing of a UN mandate and provides a military presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina to help maintain a safe and secure environment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This contribution reflects the UK’s strong political support for EUFOR Operation ALTHEA and our determination to help maintain a safe and secure environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the security situation in the region remains calm and stable, it is essential that we provide EUFOR with the necessary resources to perform the mission’s mandate in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EUFOR provides an important safeguard underpinning stability and ensuring that Bosnia and Herzegovina can continue to make progress on its path towards EU and NATO accession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pledge of more troops in support of Operation ALTHEA will not take place until December in order not to impact on the Armed Forces’ commitment to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR Operation ALTHEA became the legal successor in December 2004 to NATO’s SFOR (Stabilisation Force) mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR has the backing of a UN Chapter VII Mandate and its aim is to ensure continued compliance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the continuance of a safe and secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces help Afghan police hold community party</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 300 people from the local area attended the party, which was organised entirely by the Afghan Uniform Police (AUP), who also provided the security for the event - the largest gathering of its kind in the Babaji area of Lashkar Gah district for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment was in the form of a band and traditional Afghan food was provided and served to the guests by the AUP. The band had travelled from Lashkar Gah and many of the police present had also come from areas outside the Babaji precinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ‘community concert’ marks a milestone in the continued success of the police to provide security and influence in the area. Within the last few months several ISAF checkpoints have been closed or handed over to the Afghan police and the final transition of Babaji to Afghan control is due to take place later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Babaji bazaar, which has been closed for the last two years due to security concerns, has recently reopened - a sign that the local population now feel secure enough to return to a state of normality that has not existed in the region for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money for the event was provided by the Operations Coordination Cell (OCC), run by the Police Monitoring and Advisory Group, which is led by 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment (1 PWRR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Paddy Munns, from 1 PWRR, is the Officer Commanding of OCC Babaji, and in the run up to the event he assisted the AUP precinct commander with planning the concert and the necessary security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day, soldiers from Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (1 YORKS), provided overwatch, but security at the event was provided solely by the Babaji AUP and the day went without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, dancing with Lieutenant Esmeri at the community concert  " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5324/UK_forces_help_Afghan_police_hold_community_party-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, dancing with Lieutenant Esmeri at the community concert [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Munns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was a hugely successful occasion and provided a fantastic opportunity for the police to socialise with the local population and continue to build on the developing relationship between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A gathering of this size hasn’t happened in Babaji for over 10 years, so that is some measure of the success of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The community concert was an excellent opportunity for the AUP, and they did themselves proud by organising the event. The AUP mixed in with the locals - dancing, socialising and serving them lunch. It allowed the AUP to show the people of Babaji that they are professional, competent and are here to serve the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band was hired from Lashkar Gah by the AUP and given a police escort to the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mangal, the band’s frontman, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I usually play at weddings and have never performed at a police-organised party. This is the first time I have seen such an event in Babaji. This would not have been possible during the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those present were the Afghan Government’s interim municipal councillor Haji Abdul Gaffoor and Lieutenant Esmeri, the commander of the Babaji police precinct. Many of the local elders were also present, highlighting the influence of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those members of ISAF present at the concert entered into the spirit of the day with Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1 YORKS, encouraging Lieutenant Esmeri to join him and others dancing in front of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babaji is part of the Lashkar Gah district, the security for which is the responsibility of the Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group aided by Support Company from 1 YORKS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK Battle Backers invited to US Warrior Games</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Games is a competitive Paralympic sporting event for wounded, injured and sick Service personnel and veterans, hosted by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British team will comprise up to 20 athletes from Her Majesty’s Armed Forces, as well as staff from personnel recovery centres and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Headley Court. Their participation is supported and funded by the UK charity, Help for Heroes (H4H). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team will be taking part in friendly competition, as guest athletes, against US Service members and veterans at the event, which will run from 30 April to 5 May 2012, in Colorado Springs, USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Games, presented by Deloitte, was created in 2010 as an introduction to Paralympic sports for wounded, injured and sick Service members and veterans. More than 200 wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women and veterans are expected to compete in seven sports in the 2012 event. The UK team will compete in five sports - archery, cycling, swimming, track and field, and sitting volleyball. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, the Battle Back programme has supported individuals in adaptive sport and adventurous training, which helps wounded, injured and sick Service personnel gain confidence and return to an active life. Battle Back is a Ministry-of-Defence-led initiative in partnership with, and funded by, both Help for Heroes and The Royal British Legion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Royal Marines (left to right) Marine Earl James, Marine Joe Townsend and Corporal John Davis during Wounded Warrior trials held at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, USA, in March 2012 " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5322/UK_Battle_Backers_invited_to_US_Warrior_Games-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 2012 Warrior Games is a fantastic opportunity for our wounded and injured Service personnel to enjoy themselves and reap the benefits of competitive sport. I am delighted that British Forces will again be building on the close relationship we have with our US allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sport is a powerful tool in the recovery of our people. Battle Back allows individuals to focus on what they can achieve, accelerating their physical, psychological and social recovery. I am proud to support these excellent games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryn Parry, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder of Help for Heroes, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At a time when David Cameron has been visiting Barack Obama to further cement the UK’s relationship with the US, as well as to discuss what they have called ‘the next stage phase of the transition’ in Afghanistan, we are delighted that Help for Heroes will support a UK team into such a high profile US event. We know how important sport is in recovery and are delighted to have supported Battle Back since its inception in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is further enhanced through the Battle Back Phoenix programme which is available in the Personnel Recovery Centres for Service personnel and veterans. Our participation in the Warrior Games is significant in raising awareness of the work that takes place worldwide in supporting wounded, injured and sick Service personnel, especially as we approach a busy year in sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO of the USOC, Scott Blackmun, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With our athletes Britain-bound this summer for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, we are excited to host our friends from the UK for this exciting competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Warrior Games truly exemplify the power not just of sport, but of the human spirit. The USOC and our partners at the Department of Defense and Veterans Association are committed to ensuring that physical activity programming is available at the community level for our nation’s heroes to participate in sport.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK Armed Forces score highly at parachuting championships</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The championships, held at the Joint Services Parachute Centre, were won by Major Alastair McCartney, aged 34, from the Royal Logistic Corps, who has now secured a place at the World Championships in Russia this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to winning the overall championships Major McCartney also won the accuracy category and came second in the speed section. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lance Corporal Sean Sutcliffe came second overall, finishing runner up in the distance section and third in accuracy, while Sergeant Wez Westley won the speed and distance events. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrant Officer Class 1 (WO1) Spencer Hogg came third in the distance section and Corporal Stu Storey, who is based at the Joint Services Parachute Centre, was declared the British Forces Germany Champion. They have all been selected to represent Britain at the World Championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven Armed Forces personnel took part in the championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Championships are open to both military personnel and civilians and are held in Germany because of the centre’s world class facilities which include one of the best parachute landing ponds in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Alastair McCartney " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5320/UK_Armed_Forces_score_highly_at_parachuting_championships-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Alastair McCartney  [Picture: Dominic King, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The championships, in which competitors jump from a height of 5,000 feet (1,500m), consist of three dangerous and complex categories: ‘speed’, in which parachutists nose dive towards the Earth at speeds approaching 100mph (160km/h) before pulling up to glide through a short course as fast as they can; ‘distance’, in which competitors navigate a course for as far as possible; and ‘accuracy’, which includes complex manoeuvres, skimming the surface of a pond and a precision landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major McCartney, who earlier this year was part of a team of soldiers mistaken for UFOs by locals while doing a winged suit jump in the skies over Sennelager, took up parachuting at the age of 16, following in the wake of his parents who are both keen parachutists. He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s an amazing sport - just like running a 100-metre sprint; you have to be athletic in what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to have won. It’s pretty exhilarating and a lot of fun to jump out of a plane and twist your parachute so you come down as fast as possible. It sounds crazy and dangerous but there is a lot of risk management, we prepare well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major McCartney, who has already served in both Iraq and Afghanistan since commissioning in 1996 and is currently learning Pashto for a return to Afghanistan, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Parachuting is a fantastic sport with high pressure where you have to make instant judgements in extreme circumstances. In this sense it is good preparation for army life as soldiers are often put in intense situations when they deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parachuting is one of the most popular adventurous training sports for Armed Forces personnel. It provides a good opportunity to hone important adventurous training skills, enhancing an individual’s ability to withstand the rigours of operations and rapid deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Sebastian Muntz, Officer Commanding the Joint Services Parachute Centre, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The closest thing to jumping out of an armed vehicle into a combat zone is jumping out of a plane with a parachute on your back. It’s an intense and high pressure sport and is an extremely useful character-building exercise for soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be a dangerous sport which is why every competitor has to do at least 1,000 jumps before being allowed to take part in the competition; you have to be confident in yourself as a parachutist and be able to put on a good show. But it’s not all about competing - we would urge anyone who wants to really challenge themselves and likes adventurous training to do a parachuting course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK Armed Forces are Pride of Britain</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a star-studded ceremony which took place on Monday, 3 October 2011, in London’s Grosvenor House Hotel, representatives from all three Services were heralded for their courage and bravery in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual awards have been designed to highlight remarkable acts carried out by British individuals and, unsurprisingly, every year the Armed Forces are amongst those recognised for the work they do both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A panel of judges, which this year included Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry VC, whittled down thousands of nominations from the general public to decide who should be singled out to be honoured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2011 marks ten years of UK operations in Afghanistan, singer Cheryl Cole visited troops in Camp Bastion last month to present a Special Recognition Award which honours all of Britain’s Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting the award to Commander Task Force Helmand, Brigadier Ed Davis, Ms Cole said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have so much respect for our Forces. We all owe them so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of her experience in Afghanistan, she said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My time in Afghanistan was amazing, really amazing. It was scary. I was terrified, I’m not ashamed to say I uttered a few expletives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the ceremony itself, Ms Cole gave a message of support to all Service personnel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keep your heads up, stay as safe as possible and I love you all,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also receiving a Special Recognition Award was Acting Sergeant Dipprasad Pun CGC (Conspicuous Gallantry Cross) of the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was honoured for his actions in September 2010 during his deployment to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting Sergeant Pun single-handedly took on dozens of insurgents when they launched an attack on his base and as a result saved the lives of three of his fellow soldiers. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was in Helmand province in the Babaji area in a very hostile area and there was a checkpoint where I was on sentry. There were many Taliban who overran that checkpoint and I was alone. I saw them and had to fight them on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Initially, when I saw two Taliban at about 200 metres away, I was scared. I opened fire at them and there were many other Taliban firing towards me; I thought that they were going to kill me. I thought, before they kill me, I have to kill as many of them as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting Sergeant Pun explained how the incident affected him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After a couple of days, it was out of my mind. I felt more confident after the incident as I thought that the Taliban don’t have as good a fighting capability as us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mr Flintoff said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I just can’t get my head around what he’s done. You go about your normal life, which for me was a bit of cricket and a bit of TV stuff, and seeing what he’s done is just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His bravery and selflessness is something I can’t get my head around. I think it’s shocked a few people to see what he’s done. A lot of people don’t know what goes on out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All the work our servicemen do is just amazing. I’m a massive supporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Klass added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you hear Dipprasad’s story, it sounds like something you usually see at the movies. When you think that one person single-handedly took on so many insurgents, let off 400 rounds of ammo and lived to be able to tell the tale, it just defies understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the RAF’s Red Arrows display team appeared on stage to present the Fundraiser of the Year Award to 91-year-old Tom Lackey who has helped to raise over £1m for charity by wing-walking in a string of record-breaking stunts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flight Lieutenant Zane Sennett from the Red Arrows said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Together with Elle Macpherson we presented Tom Lackey with a Pride of Britain Award. He’s just finished his wing-walk as a 91-year-old and he’s still doing a lot of stuff for charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He mentioned that he has a favourite pilot who flies the biplane that does the loop-the-loop with him and we’re very much his favourite group of pilots, so it was a real honour to present this award. It was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the ceremony, the Pride of Britain judges invited wounded Service personnel from Row2Recovery and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) Ride of Britain to appear on stage to be acknowledged for their sterling efforts and the challenges they volunteer for. See Related News to read more about these events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many celebrities who attended the awards were keen to voice their support and encouragement for the UK’s Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supermodel Elle Macpherson said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keep the faith. We’re so proud of you. The amount of courage, dedication and bravery that these guys have is formidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TV presenter Gethin Jones said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No words of mine would help, but I hope they all know and you can’t undervalue saying this too many times, but everyone’s so proud of the work they do out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They are true heroes in every sense of the word and we hope that they will stay safe and come back safe as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tulisa Contostavlos from the X Factor TV show said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Boys, girls, keep doing what you’re doing. Everyone back home loves you and we miss you and we’re rooting for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footballer Robbie Savage said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They’re just so brave. You think you’re brave standing in front of millions of people on a Saturday night to dance, that’s nothing in comparison to what those guys do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and Vietnam sign Defence Co-operation Memorandum of Understanding</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Astor of Hever, Parliamentary under Secretary of State for Defence, signed the MOU with Lieutenant General Nguyen Chi Vinh, Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of National Defence, at Lancaster House today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signing of this MOU follows on from the Strategic Partnership Declaration signed on 8 September 2010 by Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Pham Gia Khiem, and the UK Foreign Secretary, William Hague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Vietnam demonstrates the UK’s commitment to pursuing an active foreign policy with emerging powers around the world. The UK aims to make the Strategic Partnership a springboard to take our growing bilateral trade relationship to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Partnership Declaration demonstrates the breadth and the depth of our co-operation, including defence and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is looking to engage more closely with countries in South East Asia and the Defence Co-operation MOU signed today between Lord Astor and Lieutenant General Vinh is another example of this regional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that today’s MOU signing will further enhance the bilateral relationship and will aid the exchange of information in areas such as training and peace support operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Astor said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the opportunity to meet with Lieutenant General Nguyen Chi Vinh today and to sign the Defence Co-operation MOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We had fruitful discussions on a number of topics and hope that the MOU will help to facilitate a deeper level of co-operation between our two nations, enhancing the bilateral relationship envisaged in the Strategic Partnership Declaration signed in London last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK and US troops work together to train Afghan Police</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams from The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (5 SCOTS), and the 1st Marine Division of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) have been jointly responsible for the training of the ANP in Afghanistan’s Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canterbury-based 5 SCOTS, which recruits predominantly from central and western Scotland, are now in the final weeks of a seven-month deployment to Helmand province, during which time they have fulfilled the role of Police Development Advisory Training Team (PDATT) within Task Force Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Marines from the 1st Marine Division have formed a unit known as the Provincial Police Advisory Team (PPAT) and have worked alongside the 5 SCOTS troops, making improvements in police recruiting, training and operations throughout Helmand. Both the Jocks and the Marines are based in Helmand’s provincial capital Lashkar Gah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Colonel John Klink of the United States Marine Corps' Provincial Police Advisory Team with Lieutenant Colonel Adam Griffiths, Commanding Officer of 5 SCOTS " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5315/UK_and_US_troops_work_together_to_train_Afghan_Police-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Colonel John Klink of the United States Marine Corps' Provincial Police Advisory Team with Lieutenant Colonel Adam Griffiths, Commanding Officer of 5 SCOTS [Picture: Corporal Pete George, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the 5 SCOTS PDATT has had responsibility for policing in the key central Helmand districts of Nad ‘Ali, Nahr-e Saraj and the city centre and outlying areas of Lashkar Gah, the US Marines have worked on improving the capabilities of the provincial police headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this recent partnership, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum researched the regimental archives to establish whether there was any record of them working together previously and discovered that the then 2nd Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the US 4th Marine Regiment served together in Shanghai in China from 1932 to 1933.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Argylls were deployed to China as an emergency battalion to ‘protect the foreign area from internal disorder and to defend it against external aggression’, as their mission was given at the time. Shanghai was split into various defence sectors controlled by different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One was held by US Marines, at the time the 4th Marine Regiment. The Argylls took over a sector close to the Marines and liaison officers were established within each headquarters. Just as the Argylls and the USMC worked successfully together in the 1930s, the modern-day partnership has seen great achievements in Helmand. Confidence amongst locals in the Afghan Police has evidently grown and the ability of the police to conduct operations unaided against the insurgency in Helmand has improved markedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ANP are now taking on more and more responsibility for providing security, as well as normal day-to-day policing, in the populated areas of Helmand, from the US and UK troops based there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subtle yet critical development in the campaign against the insurgency has been increasingly to view IED emplacement and other acts of violence against UK, US and Afghan troops as criminal acts rather than acts of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewing them this way puts the emphasis on the Afghan Police to take primacy in the counter-insurgency effort. As such, crime scene exploitation, evidence-handling, and deeper understanding of powers of arrest and detention are now the focus of training the police and mentoring them on their day-to-day operations. Lieutenant Colonel Adam Griffiths, Commanding Officer of 5 SCOTS and the man responsible for leading the PDATT’s efforts throughout the deployment, commented on the work his battalion has done with the US Marines throughout the tour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This has very much been a joint effort working closely to develop the capacity of the ANP and, in particular, the Afghan Uniformed Police,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen demonstrable change over the past seven months and both the Jocks, in the form of the PDATT, and the Marines, as the PPAT, have worked hard to improve the accountability, sustainability and professionalism of the police here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience working with the US Marine Corps. Our antecedent regiments have history working together and it has been a joy to rekindle that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To acknowledge the work done together during this tour of Afghanistan, Lieutenant Colonel Griffiths presented each member of the USMC PPAT with a ‘Glengarry’, the traditional formal headdress of the Scottish infantry soldier worn on ceremonial occasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, Colonel John Klink of the USMC PPAT presented the Argylls with their divisional insignia and a USMC badge of rank, representing each of the 5 SCOTS soldiers’ and officers’ own rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the reasons behind the recent success of the ANP in Helmand, General Hakim Angar, Helmand Chief of Police said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The foremost reasons are training and education. Now policemen better understand what is required of them and how to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have imposed strict discipline amongst our ranks and have rooted out practices which are contrary to the law. As I tell the people of Helmand, ‘the police and the people are one’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-us-troops-enjoy-barbecue-at-downing-street"/>
    <title>UK and US troops enjoy barbecue at Downing Street</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event was hosted by the UK Prime Minister’s wife, Samantha Cameron, and the US’s First Lady, Michelle Obama, while their husbands held meetings inside 10 Downing Street. Although Mr Cameron and Mr Obama did help to serve lunch - meeting and paying tribute to the men and women in uniform from both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 47 US Service personnel attending the barbecue, there were also 45 UK Service and civilian personnel representing the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, British Army, Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All have served in operational theatres on joint US-UK deployments, including Iraq, Afghanistan or both - some for multiple deployments. A few of the individuals from the UK at the barbecue have worked very closely with US units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like their American colleagues, some of the UK personnel have received combat decorations and some have been decorated by the US military as well for their exemplary service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the four Royal Navy personnel present was Lieutenant Commander Victoria Dale-Smith, a Commando Sea King pilot who flew missions in Iraq at the start of Op TELIC in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the six Royal Marines in attendance was Lance Corporal Joe LeBorgne who, during his latest deployment to Afghanistan in 2010, was part of a patrol tasked with rescuing the US crew of a Black Hawk helicopter which had landed in the vicinity of his patrol base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food to a serviceman during a barbecue in the garden of 10 Downing Street  " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5313/UK_and_US_troops_enjoy_barbecue_at_Downing_Street-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the personnel have played their own particular role on operations - Lieutenant Colonel Gerry Ewart-Brookes’ regiment was heavily involved in the handover of Sangin from UK to US control, while Wing Commander David Scott Heather was awarded the US Meritorious Service Medal for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Goldsack, a MOD civilian, was deployed to Afghanistan with the Defence Support Group, who maintain and repair military vehicles and equipment, and Sergeant David McIlwraith was deployed with the MOD Police (MDP) and was involved with the training of Afghan National Police personnel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Right from the start, MDP officers like myself have been training and mentoring the Afghan National Police as part of the UK’s contribution out there, working alongside the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recently, we had a particularly strong and effective relationship with 5 SCOTS [5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland] at the Helmand Police Training Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today was really special. As a small part of a huge operation, to be honoured in this way today is just fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the spouses of the Service personnel serve in military family support programmes, child development centres, military community libraries and schools, and scholarship associations for military children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister and President Obama announced the establishment of a Service Personnel Task Force which aims to deliver the best possible support for serving members of the Armed Forces and veterans - see Related News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and US soldiers strengthen ties with jump onto Salisbury Plain</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pudsey-based soldiers from 4th Battalion The Parachute Regiment (4 PARA) joined forces with members of the US Army’s Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne) who are based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paratroopers built on their knowledge and experience of airborne operations by jumping using each other’s equipment and both nations’ Hercules C-130 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to parachute in another nation’s parachute equipment allows the soldier to wear that country’s coveted wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US paratroopers flew into the UK only days before jumping with the Brits. They are over in Europe not only to establish and continue working relations with the Paras, but also to take part in a parachute jump into Normandy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the 68th anniversary of the D-Day landings, and was when the partnership was first forged. The American reserve unit has been taking part in the re-enactment for the last 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two US C-130 aircraft were brought over for the occasion but the US paratroopers got to jump out of a British Hercules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A member of the US Army's Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne) prepares to jump during Exercise Airdrop Warrior " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5311/UK_and_US_soldiers_strengthen_ties_with_jump_onto_Salisbury_Plain-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A member of the US Army's Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne) prepares to jump during Exercise Airdrop Warrior  [Picture: Captain Tom McShane, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Americans to jump was Brigadier General Al Stolte, Deputy Commanding General of the US Army’s Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne), who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over a number of years we have had a good relationship with the UK and other Para organisations and so it is a good chance for interoperability training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We like to have the British forces over to America and we like to come over here and build up the camaraderie. We work together a lot when we are deployed so this is really great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members of 4 PARA, which is a reserve unit, often train and operate with their regular counterparts. The majority of the unit have served on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, as the British Army does not know what tasks it might be faced with in the future, the Paras need to be trained for every eventuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Training Major for 4 PARA, Major Justin Tancrel, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We deploy on operations with the US and exit their aircraft quite frequently so it is beneficial for us to learn their skills and drills and that is what we are practising today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and US navies compare training for Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six Royal Navy instructors who visited America last week are based at the Pre-deployment Training and Mounting Centre in Portsmouth. They met their American counterparts at the US Army’s combat training centre at Fort Jackson in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to length of deployment and type of training, the US and the UK have their own ways of doing things and it was hoped that this visit might provide a knowledge-sharing opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Portsmouth most of the instructors are Royal Marines with operational experience, whereas the US Navy sailors are taught by the Army at one of eight military bases across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK around 1,000 sailors are trained every year as Individual Augmentees (IAs) who deploy to Afghanistan on a one-in-one-out basis, whereas in the US the total is nearer 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IAs can be sailors trained in a wide range of skills such as logistics, admin, intelligence or operations, and are able to join units already based in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK the maximum deployment period is six months, whereas in the US it is up to a year. In both cases sailors may be required to provide support to bases on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both countries are keen to learn from each other, the ultimate goal of the training is exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="American sailors participate in the US Navy Individual Augmentee combat training course at Fort Jackson, South Carolina " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5309/UK_and_US_navies_compare_training_for_Afghanistan-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;American sailors participate in the US Navy Individual Augmentee combat training course at Fort Jackson, South Carolina  [Picture: Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class R Jason Brunson, US Navy 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six Royal Naval instructors who visited Fort Jackson, officer-in-charge of the Portsmouth Mounting Centre, Lieutenant Commander Pat O’Callaghan, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The courses both run on the exact same principle - to get the sailors up to the standard that is required to work with land forces on the ground in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our course is slightly longer than the US, but they both cover all the fundamental aspects of pre-deployment training - cultural awareness, counter-IED, weapon-handling, medical trauma treatment, and how to protect themselves while on foot or vehicle patrols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There were a few differences on both sides - for example we use real life amputees in our scenarios whereas they use mannequins, but the US have a very good administrative system when it comes to issuing kit which we think we may also incorporate into our practices here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a navy’s traditional role involves working with ships on the water, a deployment to Afghanistan can be challenging for some IAs. Lt Cdr O’Callaghan said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is something brand new for them. They are no longer on their ships and are instead drawing on all their military skills to survive out on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mounting Centre in Portsmouth trains groups of 80 personnel 12 times a year to ensure a constant rotation in the main operating bases in Afghanistan, the forward operating bases, the headquarters in Kabul and for those mentoring the Afghan National Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first two weeks the sailors take part in SA80 rifle training where they must produce consistently tight grouping on their targets at a range of 300 metres both in normal daylight and reduced light at night - the same requirement as that of Army personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once issued with their weapon, each serviceman must make sure they are confident with all the handling aspects by repeatedly stripping, cleaning and firing the rifle as it will be their constant companion for the duration of their tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the intensive two-week weapon course, each group is then taught vital survival skills such as a smattering of the local language, medical trauma treatment, an understanding of IEDs and mines, and also how to protect themselves on foot or vehicle patrols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week then follows at Longmoor training camp in Hampshire where the sailors put their newly-learnt skills into practice on exercise around a makeshift forward operating base - taking part in foot and vehicle patrols, coping with constant ambushes, and returning fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox and Secretary Gates both reinforced their commitment to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox said he thought hard about the issue before accepting the position of Defence Secretary last month, concluding there is still a national security imperative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that we cannot afford Afghanistan to lapse back into a failed state which will create a security vacuum which will contaminate the region and possibly well beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are committed to seeing it through to a resolution. By that I mean creating a stable enough Afghanistan to manage its own internal and external security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox said British troops would stay until Afghanistan was ‘stable enough’ to ensure internal and foreign security and the nation was run by the Afghans for the Afghans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questioned whether British forces would move from Helmand to Kandahar at some point in the future Dr Fox said that UK forces had built up a strong understanding of the terrain and personalities unique to Helmand and that a move to Kandahar would be ‘quite a leap’ which would also incur a large cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He concluded that it would therefore be ‘highly unlikely’ that any such move would happen and it is not something the UK Government would be proposing or indeed something that ISAF Commander, General Stanley McChrystal, has proposed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he added that the nature of the effort would inevitably change over time, with Secretary Gates making clear that July 2011 was the US target for the beginning of military withdrawal, dependent on ‘conditions on the ground’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary Gates paid tribute to the British contribution to the ISAF effort in Afghanistan and said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops are demonstrating incredible courage on the battlefields of southern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I told Dr Fox how much we in America appreciate his nation’s leadership in this effort and I offered my condolences for the nearly 300 British troops who have been lost in the conflict, including several just this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To paraphrase a poet from the Great War, British fighting men and women have more than done their bit and… had their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran was also a key feature of the discussions. Mr Gates said he was hopeful the United Nations Security Council would pass a resolution designed to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons ‘very soon’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox was also optimistic in that regard and warned that if Iran were to become a nuclear power it would destabilise the entire region and ‘may well be the end of the NPT [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] as we know it’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dr Fox said a new UN resolution backed by the entire global community would demonstrate to the Iranian leadership how ‘serious’ the situation was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both men also said that they agreed on the need for reform of NATO and would work together to achieve their aims in this area and Dr Fox said Britain would take lessons from the US when it decides on the future of Defence in the Strategic Defence and Security Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and US defence chiefs assess Afghanistan and Libya operations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox and General Richards met with US Defence Secretary, Robert Gates and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, to make an assessment of various operational missions and to discuss the possibility of exploiting the emerging opportunities on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After visiting the Pentagon, Dr Fox said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would first like to thank Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen for hosting General Richards and myself here at the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, as throughout much of our shared history, the UK and US stand shoulder to shoulder in Afghanistan, the Gulf, fighting piracy and, now, in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We had a wide range of discussions including the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, developments in the Middle East, and the evolving situation in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Afghanistan, we discussed the way ahead for the transition process and the challenges ISAF and our Afghan partners will face heading into the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the Middle East, we had very constructive discussions on the challenges presented by the current situation in the region. With Syria in particular we are both deeply concerned by the recent reports of security forces killing demonstrators. The Syrian government must start addressing the legitimate political demands of its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="US Defence Secretary Robert M Gates (left) and UK Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox conduct a press conference on the steps of the Pentagon following defence talks" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5305/UK_and_US_defence_chiefs_assess_Afghanistan_and_Libya_operations-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“On Libya, we had good discussions on how to better exploit emerging opportunities on the ground. I’m extremely grateful to the US for their recent contribution of armed Predator UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles] which will give NATO and our Arab allies greater capability to take out [Gaddafi] regime forces that continue to threaten the civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is little doubt across the alliance that this key contribution has proven to be of immense value protecting civilians in Misurata and has helped Opposition forces to defend themselves against this brutal regime there. This is further strengthened by Italy’s recent announcement of additional air to ground attack capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen significant progress made in the last 72 hours with Gaddafi’s forces losing their grip on Misurata and we have received reports of under-age soldiers and foreign mercenaries being captured — this underlines the regimes inability to rely on its own security forces. These are the tactics of an increasingly desperate and weak regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and US agree continued support for Armed Forces Community</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following President Obama’s visit to the UK in May 2011 a Service Personnel Task Force was established between the UK and the US to share experiences and best practice, including strategies for supporting wounded, injured and sick personnel and how best to help those leaving the Services transition into civilian life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday’s meeting is the third meeting of the Task Force but the first to be jointly chaired by UK Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Andrew Robathan, and, in his first official visit to the Ministry of Defence, the US Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Dr Clifford Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Robathan said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As our servicemen and women have stood together historically, and in recent operations, so the US and UK will stand together in recognising the sacrifices made by them and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our nations share the belief that there is much benefit to be gained through continued close engagement, and through the Service Personnel, Families and Veterans Task Force we will seek to learn from shared information and best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Both nations ask a great deal from our Armed Forces and believe they have a right to expect a commitment from us to support them through the challenges of Service life. In the UK that commitment is embraced within the Armed Forces Covenant, the principles of which we are writing into law for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force is headed up by Dr Stanley and Mr Robathan, brings together teams of UK and US experts from inside government, and seeks the views and involvement of the charitable and business sectors. The Task Force focuses on three strands of work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting wounded, injured and sick personnel, including physical and psychological care and rehabilitation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting Service personnel, veterans and families, in particular linking them to local communities &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting the transition of those leaving the Services into civilian life, including vocational training and education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-us-carry-out-air-tanking-exercise"/>
    <title>UK and US carry out air tanking exercise</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An L-1011 TriStar from 216 Squadron, based at RAF Brize Norton, deployed to RAF Mildenhall which is home to 100th Air Refueling Wing, the only US Air Force (USAF) air refuelling wing in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK TriStar flew alongside a USAF KC-135 Stratotanker in a unique refuelling exercise, created after experiences in recent combat operations over Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No record of a formation flight comprised of US Air Force and RAF tankers can be found, and, although it can’t be confirmed that it has never been done, the training is the first of its kind in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air-to-air refuelling is a key capability for RAF air power operations. Mid-air refuelling by tanker aircraft enables other aircraft to travel thousands of miles without the need to land, and extends the time they can spend on patrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the aircrews completed their pre-flight briefings together at RAF Mildenhall and took off in formation, the tankers flew out over the North Sea within a few miles of each other, and kept that distance throughout the aerial refuelling procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, apart from the formation aspect, the flight was a routine training sortie, but the experience was worth more than just logged hours for the crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After NATO operations in Libya in 2011, the need for allied nations to familiarise their air forces with air-refuelling operations was identified. NATO air-refuelling procedures are laid down in publications, but the formation gave the crews valuable practical experience.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most modern day operations, the RAF integrates with allied armed forces from around the world, and joint training maintains the RAF’s ability to swiftly combine with the armed forces of many different nations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re building partnerships with our international allies,” said Captain Mark Berthelotte of the 351st Air Refueling Squadron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for the training was brought up at the 2012 European Tanker Symposium, which was hosted at RAF Mildenhall and included tanker crews from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symposium included briefings and guided discussions about lessons learned from Libya, the future of European refuelling and a familiarisation ride in a KC-135 flight simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Captain Berthelotte, during Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR, the 2011 Libya operation, refuelling sorties were taking up vast amounts of airspace, and through formation training the aircrews hope to identify ways to better utilise that space. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The purpose of [the formation training] is, instead of using three tankers and taking up 9,000 feet [2.7km], we could use three tankers and take up about half that amount of airspace. This will allow for more space to be used by other military aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the airborne portion of the training, relocating the TriStar and its crews to RAF Mildenhall allowed 216 Squadron to experience working from an unfamiliar base, useful training for the squadron’s deployments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Phil McConnell, from 216 Squadron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It provides us with the opportunity to practise deploying to complete air-to-air refuelling missions from somewhere different than our home base. That’s not something we get the chance to do very often. This essential training allows us to operate safely and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
