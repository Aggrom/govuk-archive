    <title>Launch of new single government website</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beta website includes a new ‘INSIDE GOVERNMENT’ section containing trial MOD corporate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time GOV.UK will eventually replace many of the separate departmental sites run by government organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine government departments are taking part in the first phase of GOV.UK’s launch: the MOD, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Health, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New MOD corporate content has been redeveloped into a framework designed to make government information more accessible and usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A concurrent six-week live test will run from 29 February - 11 April, including a review of the new shared publishing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating departments will keep adding to the site over the six-week trial period at the end of which there will be a pause and an evaluation of feedback received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2012, the MOD website will continue to be the official source of defence-related information until a transition date has been agreed. There will then be a period of time when organisations will run both old and new sites in parallel whilst a final date for closure of the old sites is agreed with the Cabinet Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, GOV.UK will eventually replace many of the separate departmental sites run by government organisations, simplifying things for users and saving millions of pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen-facing section of GOV.UK was launched on 31 January 2012 and aims to serve the needs of the mainstream majority better by speeding up and facilitating essential transactions such as registering a birth or renewing car tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its target is to replace both Directgov and Business Link in 2012, reducing costs to the public purse, improving the user’s experience, and making all government information easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government part of the site is about meeting the needs of the engaged minority who, like the MOD audience, visit frequently and are likely to spend longer on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New features and interactive opportunities will make life much easier for those frequent users of government websites, focusing on their needs far more than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the new GOV.UK site will be located on the MOD internet and intranet sites for users to find parallel content easily and quickly. More links will be placed as new content is published and available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Millies heroes honoured at awards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="support-to-the-armed-forces-award"&gt;Support to the Armed Forces Award&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army widow Nikki Scott won the Support to the Armed Forces Award for her charity &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.scottyslittlesoldiers.co.uk/" title="Scotty's Little Soldiers"&gt;Scotty’s Little Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. The charity supports the children of men and women killed while serving in the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikki set up the charity in August 2010 after her husband, Corporal Lee Scott, was killed in Afghanistan in July 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scotty’s Little Soldiers aims to help as many children as possible up to the age of 18 by funding days out and paying for birthday and Christmas presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikki said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Winning this is overwhelming but I’m very proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Oliver handed Nikki her award and hailed her ‘wonderful spirit’. He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a sacrifice beyond most people made not just by one family but by many families. As a dad of four, it’s probably the hardest award I’ve ever given. You can’t change what’s happened but what Nikki has done is really important. I’m so impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Prime Minister and his wife with members of 3rd Battalion The Rifles" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5432/PMand3rifles.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Prime Minister and his wife with members of 3rd Battalion The Rifles and their Best Unit Award [Picture: The Sun newspaper]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praising the Millies, the TV chef said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s completely integral to pay our respects to the people that have done extraordinary things in extraordinary circumstances. There is not a job like it; we expect a lot and it’s really important that we give these guys a pat on the back and I think that’s what’s so brilliant about the Millies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="best-unit-award"&gt;Best Unit Award&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highly coveted award for Best Unit went to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/5974.aspx" title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3rd Battalion The Rifles&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3 RIFLES&lt;/abbr&gt;) for their work on Operation HERRICK. The unit were part of the Brigade Advisory Group mentoring the Afghan Army and Police. Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha presented the award to the unit, which is based in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, soldiers from &lt;abbr title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3 RIFLES&lt;/abbr&gt; took on the challenge of training the Afghan security forces. By building trust through shared dangers on the front line, they helped transform the capability of local forces. This approach was ably demonstrated on the day that Advisor 40 - a company of men that was part of &lt;abbr title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3 RIFLES&lt;/abbr&gt; - risked their lives to save a badly injured Afghan soldier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of their arrival to mentor Afghan troops in Lashkar Gah, a rogue Afghan soldier from the base next door shot 2 British servicemen at the gates. Refusing to be cowed, despite the obvious risks, this event showed the dedication of the soldiers to the task at hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 3 months later, 3 British troops raced over open ground under enemy fire to rescue an Afghan who had been shot, gave life-saving first aid, and then ran back, all under fire. This was just one example of the commitment and courage of the troops carrying out advisory roles in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental Sergeant Major) James Mockridge said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Prime Minister"&gt;PM&lt;/abbr&gt; thanked us and said he was really pleased with our achievements in moving the Afghan National Army forward in the campaign. Hopefully it has put us in a better place than when we started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether it was the cherry on the cake to have the Prime Minister hand over the award, &lt;abbr title="Warrant Officer Class 1"&gt;WO1&lt;/abbr&gt; Mockridge said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most definitely! For our unit, the honour doesn’t get much higher than the Prime Minister giving us an award. It’s not only fantastic for us but for all the Riflemen back in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/4685336/the-sun-military-awards-2012-roll-of-honour.html" title="Sun Military Awards roll of honour"&gt;The Millies&lt;/a&gt; awards ceremony on ITV1 at 2100hrs on Friday 14 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Soldiers offer ground expertise to aerial assets in Afghanistan </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Army &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx" title="Apache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are often called upon to neutralise enemy threats, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" title="Royal Air Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; plays an equally important role with their impressive fleet of fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fearsome aerial assets fly out of Kandahar and, although the pilots and support crew are based well outside &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/" title="British Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; circles, they have direct access to all things green courtesy of skilled ground liaison officers (GLOs) who are embedded within their squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such personnel act as a link between the 2 Services to ensure those in the air have a clear understanding of the situation below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornado.cfm" title="Tornado GR4"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; Force’s War Week exercise at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/" title="RAF Marham"&gt;RAF Marham&lt;/a&gt;, Captain James Perring of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/24651.aspx" title="1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment"&gt;1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about taking everything that is happening on the ground and translating that into basic speak for the aircrew. They have no idea about the situation on the ground so we talk them through the process. I get involved with anything that is Army-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to give as much information as possible so when they are up in the sky they know where people are and what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring is now on a four-month deployment with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/9squadron.cfm" title="9 Squadron"&gt;9 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan and the serviceman was quick to highlight the differences between his roles with the RAF and Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Ground Liaison Officer"&gt;GLO&lt;/abbr&gt; is a posting I applied for and is something completely different. I had no idea or appreciation of how air assets work so it has given me great insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is going to be an interesting tour and in a way I will have a greater understanding of the bigger picture in Afghanistan compared to spending 6 months on foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5427/tornadosg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring joined the Tornado Force for the War Week exercise at RAF Marham [Picture: Graeme Main, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working with the RAF has been a bit of a culture shock. Sometimes the bureaucracy can be frustrating but it works for them and it is like that for a reason. It has been hard to adjust but there are positives to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring was not the only soldier involved in War Week. Major Jeremy Higgins of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/23445.aspx" title="Royal Artillery"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt;, a reservist who is a director for Cross Country Trains, was also on hand to offer expert advice and guidance from an Army perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise is designed to test personnel on the scenarios they are likely to face in theatre and the officer was determined to add as much realism as possible. Major Higgins said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to ensure the aircrew get the training they need ahead of the deployment, while tying in with other agencies such as forward air controllers. It is about orchestrating different elements in the air and on the ground so when the jets go out they get the training they require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will be talking to troops in the field beforehand, asking what they need and what they are trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The aircrew also highlight the areas they want to work on, such as night missions, and the soldiers come up with different scenarios for them. Effectively we have two serials feeding into one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a close link between the two forces, GLOs are mindful of not overloading their airborne colleagues with unfamiliar Army tactics and thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not just UK personnel who benefit from the support offered by the Tornado crews. Major Higgins explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Preparing a Tornado for take off" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5428/tornados3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;RAF personnel preparing a Tornado for take off at Kandahar Airfield (library image) [Picture: Corporal Andy Benson RAF, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be quite challenging as we cover the whole of Afghanistan and can be allocated anywhere. It is an international role and we have to get information from soldiers who do not have English as their first language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We give the aircrews some situational awareness and that can be quite important due to the various forces we work with. They have different kit, depending on what they are doing, so a footprint of life on the ground is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Toyota Hilux with guys in the back could be perceived as being the enemy, but it may also be local allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about adding value in any way we can. We may be asked simple questions or ones that completely floor us. We interact with land troops to get a picture of what they want from the fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for aerial assets is inevitably strong as soldiers maintain the Army’s operational tempo and such requests mean the RAF are on high alert during the training cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Lisa Foy, the acting officer in command of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/aboutus/opswg.cfm" title="RAF Marham - Operations Wing"&gt;RAF Marham’s Operations Wing&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is always more demand than we can meet but we strive to match the requirements from Land whenever possible. We want to benefit the personnel on exercise while training the Tornado crews as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise that the Force needs to train with soldiers and War Week is the perfect opportunity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A lot of 9 Squadron’s training during this phase has been provided by the Army, and GLOs are critical in bringing everything together. Our expertise is in the air and these guys form a crucial link with the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report by Richard Long is taken from the December 2012 edition of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/soldier-magazine/soldier-magazine.aspx" title="Soldier magazine"&gt;Soldier&lt;/a&gt; - the magazine of the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Latest UK Armed Forces manning figures released</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is up from 97.4 per cent a year ago and shows a continuing upward trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18,630 new recruits have joined the UK Regular Forces in the 12 months to 30 June 2010. This is a decrease of 5,010 from the 12 months to 30 June 2009 as the Armed Forces are now very nearly fully-manned, meaning there is a reduced intake requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics also show that the number of people leaving the trained strength of the UK Regular Forces in the 12 months to 30 June 2010 has fallen by 9.8 per cent (1,990 people) compared with the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As at 1 July 2010, the full-time trained strength of the UK Armed Forces was 178,380, against a target of 178,880. This comprises 173,930 UK Regular Forces, 830 Full-Time Reserve Service personnel and 3,610 Gurkhas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Secretary of State for Defence, Andrew Robathan, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is encouraging to see that a career in our Armed Forces is proving to be a popular choice, so much so that we are at almost 100 per cent of our manning requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our personnel are some of the best in the world and the work they are doing in operational theatres and back in the UK demonstrates this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the numbers of people we need to recruit have reduced, recruitment continues, and, with more people staying in the Armed Forces too, we continue to strengthen all three Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1 July 2009, the proportion of females in the UK Regular Forces has remained static at 12.1 per cent for officers, and risen from 9.0 per cent to 9.1 per cent for other ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The percentage of UK Regular Forces from ethnic minority backgrounds has remained static at 6.6 per cent of UK Regular Forces since 1 July 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Latest students graduate from Defence Academy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defence Academy is the UK’s Defence higher educational establishment. It is responsible for post-graduate education and the majority of command, staff, leadership, Defence management, acquisition, and technology training for members of the UK armed forces and MOD civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Command and Staff Course comprises a number of modules looking at a wide spectrum of military, political and international issues and aims to prepare officers for high grade appointments by giving them a much greater knowledge of Defence as a whole, as well as exposing them to the challenges and complexities posed by working alongside other Government departments, and civilian organisations and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is also aimed at developing command, analytical and communication skills and providing a broad understanding and knowledge of single-Service, joint and combined operations, and of Defence as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as receiving lectures from the most senior officers and civil servants in the MOD, the Secretary of State for Defence and other Government Ministers have also attended over the last year, thus allowing students to gain insight into the structure and workings of the MOD and Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lectures, workshops, discussions, debate, table-top exercises, and external visits are combined with formal assessments and exams throughout the course. Add to that a 15,000 word research paper on a Defence-related subject chosen by the student, and you have a course that is very demanding intellectually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Advanced Command and Staff Course comprises a number of modules looking at a wide spectrum of military, political and international issues" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5413/Latest_students_graduate_from_Defence_Academy_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Advanced Command and Staff Course comprises a number of modules looking at a wide spectrum of military, political and international issues [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course is undertaken in partnership with King’s College London, and thus, while students gain the Staff College qualification there is also the opportunity to gain a Master’s degree in Military Studies alongside diplomas in Strategic Management and Leadership as part of the academic element of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 286 students (RN/RM 56, Army 72, RAF 63 and UK Govt Depts five) of which 90 are international students from 58 countries represent the top ten per cent of the officer cadre from across UK Defence and the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international students, who are fully integrated into all aspects of the course, come from the full range of NATO, European and Commonwealth countries, as well as a number from the Middle East, and from other countries as far afield as South Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Japan and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commandant of the Joint Services Command and Staff College, Air Vice-Marshal Ray Lock, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each year the Advanced Command and Staff Course provides a truly world-class education to 300 selected British, International Military and Civilian Officers who represent the top ten per cent of their generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The students’ successful completion of this Master’s-level course is a very significant achievement - it marks the end of an immensely demanding year where they have been challenged in many, many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Their exposure to military studies, to the higher management of Defence both in the UK and abroad, and to a wide range of global issues will enable them to flourish in the difficult and challenging future we all face, from whichever country they may come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The course has also proved to be an ideal opportunity to improve the relationship and all-round understanding between the UK students and the other 57 countries represented on the course, and it also gains the UK significant international influence. But it is all about the students - and this bunch has been tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Latest helmet saves soldiers' lives in Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranger Silbert Wilson, aged 20, Corporal Tommy Creighton, 25, and Ranger Alan Hawthorne, 23, all from Northern Ireland, walked away unscathed after Taliban bullets aimed at their heads were stopped by the recently-introduced Mark 7 combat helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three separate incidents follow another escape by their colleague Ranger Ryan Boyd, 26, also from 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment, who walked away with just a bruise after an insurgent round fired directly at him was stopped by his Osprey body armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Wilson, from Antrim, was the first to test the helmet’s strength. That day he went out with A Company on a normal morning patrol in the Nad ‘Ali district, part of furthering the soldiers’ understanding of the local area and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patrol had been on task for almost two hours, moving around compounds and interacting with locals, when they suddenly came under enemy small arms fire. The soldiers took cover in a 5-foot-deep (1.5m) irrigation ditch and got ready to return fire - but the incoming rounds then stopped as suddenly as they had started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of minutes’ wait, the patrol was moving out of the ditch into another, shallower irrigation channel when the Taliban fighters opened up on them again, this time with machine gun fire and single rounds coming from at least four different firing points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Wilson recalled: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single round landed about two metres in front of me. I was moving to get into better cover when suddenly it felt like someone punched me on the side of my head. I was pushed off my feet and ended up submerged in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was no time to think. I got up, fired my weapon back at the enemy firing points; once the magazine was empty I reloaded a fresh magazine, and only then started to check myself. My face first - no blood! I thought ‘thank &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;, that was really close!’. I was still confused and a bit dazed. My head was ringing - but I was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ranger Silbert Wilson and the Mark 7 combat helmet which saved his life" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5410/Latest_helmet_saves_soldiers__lives_in_Afghanistan_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Ranger Silbert Wilson and the Mark 7 combat helmet which saved his life [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranger Wilson and the rest of the patrol subsequently conducted a fighting withdrawal out of contact, eventually returning to their checkpoint unscathed. Once they got back it became apparent he was not the only one to have experienced a close call that day - his colleague Lance Corporal Keith Morrison, from Templepatrick, had taken a shot clean through his daysack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Creighton, from Carrickfergus, was the next to feel the benefit of the Mark 7 helmet’s cutting-edge technology. He was out on patrol with B Company in Nad ‘Ali in the early hours of the morning, having been dropped off in a Mastiff vehicle operated by the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patrol was not far from a patrol base when they heard the sound of a round being fired in their direction. Corporal Creighton saw movement from a compound wall off to his side and, looking through his weapon sight, he identified an insurgent with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher on his shoulder. When the insurgent noticed that Corporal Creighton had seen him, he panicked, fired off the missile in his general direction and quickly ducked back behind the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullets then started coming at the soldiers from all directions, from multiple firing points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Creighton, along with colleagues Lance Corporal Fraser Stirling and Ranger Kevin McMaster, took cover in a dry drainage ditch and returned fire at identified firing points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Taliban opened up with some accurate small arms fire in our direction, and we were returning fire,” said Corporal Creighton. “As I was observing forward, confirming new enemy positions, it seemed like it happened in slow motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I saw the strike of a round hit the ground in front of me. I could actually see the strike - the dirt lifting. My reaction was to lower my head, tilting it slightly forward, and then I felt the thud against my helmet as the round struck me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I thought ‘&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;!’. My right leg started to shake. But I composed myself, identified the compound from where the round had come and engaged back returning fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contact with the insurgents carried on for a further three hours (a total of four). Eventually an Apache helicopter was called for and engaged the remaining insurgents, bringing the contact to a conclusion.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Creighton added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we got back to the patrol base, the lads were all looking at the helmet and saying how lucky I was. The round had struck me right on my ‘shamrock’ regimental badge, which I guess is kind of symbolic! But at the end of the day it’s a great bit of kit and that’s what it’s designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Hawthorne, from Dromore, was the third Royal Irish soldier to walk away after a bullet to the head. He had been conducting a clearance patrol with C Company in southern Nad ‘Ali and his platoon had taken up position in a local resident’s compound, with the owner’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing the soldiers do when they occupy a compound is to secure it and build a good overwatch position. As the one who carries the machine gun, Ranger Hawthorne is usually the first to give protection for the remainder of the patrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this occasion, just as his section commander had radioed through to confirm they were in place, shots began firing over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Hawthorne recalled: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we identified muzzle flash from the insurgents’ weapons and located their positions, we returned fire. As I was firing my machine gun, I felt a big thud - it was like someone had dropped a block on my head. It was a shock, but, with the enemy still firing at me, I had no choice but to keep returning fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When things quietened down, my section commander, Corporal Kyle Scott, tapped me on the shoulder - he was pointing to my head. That’s when I realised what had happened. I’d been so involved in the shooting that I had thought nothing more about the thud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the shooting finished, Corporal Scott called me down from my position. I took my helmet off. Lots of the boys gathered round and they were all pointing at the big gash the bullet had made in the side of my helmet. I have to say, I feel like a lucky boy, but it just shows the quality of the kit we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Jeffrey Herbert, spokesman for 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment, said of all the incidents: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These guys are all entitled to feel pretty lucky after what they’ve been through, but the fact we’ve now had three soldiers saved by this helmet goes to show what fantastic personal protective equipment we now have in the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aside from that though, I think the way all three of the lads kept their composure after being hit and carried on fighting, only thinking to assess the damage after the contact was over, says a great deal about the character of the Royal Irish Regiment. These lads are as much a credit to the British Army as the helmets that saved their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Latest counter-IED equipment showcased</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, formally opened this year’s show at the Millbrook vehicle testing ground in Bedfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Luff was then given a demonstration of some of the latest counter-IED (C-IED) equipment being used by British troops and met soldiers who had survived IED blasts thanks to the heavily armoured vehicles in which they were travelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the event he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tackling the IED threat is vital for us to make military progress. C-IED is not just about the bomb disposal expert defusing a bomb, vital and dangerous though that role is. It is about making sure that our soldiers have a range of tools, tactics and techniques available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Luff was given a guided tour of the five pieces of equipment that make up Talisman, the newest military solution to the IED problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five elements consist of two enormous armoured vehicles, a JCB digger, a bomb disposal robot and a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Talisman system is currently being used by Royal Engineers to clear and build safe routes around Helmand province in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mastiff armoured vehicle and its crew act as Talisman’s eyes, with video screens inside the rear compartment of the truck displaying aerial video footage gathered by a Honeywell T-Hawk UAV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another armoured vehicle known as Buffalo has a remote-controlled, extendable, pronged arm attached to the front, which is used to comb or ‘rummage’ the ground, detecting signs of IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Talon remote-controlled robot forms part of the latest counter-IED technology" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5408/Latest_counter-IED_equipment_showcased_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Talon remote-controlled robot forms part of the latest counter-IED technology [Picture: Andrew Linnett, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JCB digger is used to fill in ditches or potholes that might prevent soldiers or vehicles from moving forward and the Talon remote-controlled robot gives troops the safer option of remaining out of harm’s way when trying to deal with any devices they find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Captain Paul Ridge, the head of the Military Manouevre Support Team that spent around 18 months developing the Talisman system, said the aim was to enable soldiers to move around the battlefield more easily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a range of equipment that has been brought together to make a system which allows early detection and the choice of either avoiding or destroying the IED.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It can be used on its own or in support of other vehicles. And the whole system can be operated from under armour. It’s just one part of the contribution towards counter-IED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers from 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh who survived two IED blasts in two days while in Afghanistan met the minister and described how the heavily armoured vehicles in which they were travelling probably saved their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusilier Danny Hughes, who was travelling in one vehicle when it hit a roadside bomb, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Mastiff is worth its weight in gold. The second time it happened there weren’t any injuries either, it was almost a case of ‘here we go again’, that’s another few hours until we can have a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle to beat the IEDs is the driving force behind an MOD contract for a tranche of 200 new Light Protected Patrol Vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two companies, SupaCat and Force Protection Europe, are competing for the contract and displayed prototype models of what they hope will be the next generation of Light Protected Patrol Vehicles (LPPVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicles will be used for a variety of patrols and so must be tough enough to cope with cross-country terrain, but also enable the troops inside to engage with the local people they encounter in more urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, Chief of Defence Materiel and the Head of Defence Equipment and Support, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As well as its protection against blasts, the LPPV must be able to operate in the harsh conditions of the desert and tight urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Luff added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will agree a contract for an initial tranche of 200 vehicles under an Urgent Operational Requirement funded from the Treasury Reserve later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first batch of vehicles is required for training by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the DVD event Mr Luff also announced a contract for more than 140 extra Jackal 2A weapons-mounted patrol vehicles in a deal worth about £45m, bringing the number of Jackal vehicles for Defence to over 500, and an extra 28 Wolfhound heavy tactical support vehicles under a £20m deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the MOD is reducing the weight troops on the front line carry with improvements to current and future infantry combat and support kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the average weight of equipment carried by an infantryman is around 66kg, but innovative weight-saving schemes have shaved more than 4.5kg from this. New kit being delivered in October could reduce this by a further 8kg. Measures implemented include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trials of new lightweight patrol rations for troops in the field that weigh less than 1kg, compared with a 24-hour ration pack that weighs around 3kg; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;new longer-life batteries to power radios and other equipment; and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new battery recharging system which reduces the number of spare batteries required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After inspecting some of the equipment at the annual DVD event and talking to soldiers and suppliers, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the modern combat soldier is better equipped than ever before, this has brought about its own challenges - mainly an increase in the weight being carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The welfare of our troops is paramount and so the work being carried out here to reduce this burden is essential to both the physical and mental well-being of our troops fighting on the front line in what can be 50-degree temperatures. The other improvements announced today are a further demonstration of our determination to equip our forces on the front line with the kit they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A newly-formed project team, - the Integrated Soldier System Executive, based at Defence Equipment and Support in Bristol, has been leading on the work to reduce the weight carried on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with lightening a soldier’s load, the welfare of personnel operating in remote locations is being improved through increasing the number of e-bluey computer terminals to enable them to communicate with loved ones and installing more showers, sinks and toilets in forward operating bases. The new ablutions facilities will be sent to Afghanistan later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Last training on the Navy's Merlin Mk1 helicopter</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen trainee pilots, observers and aircrewmen from 824 Naval Air Squadron at Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose are spending five weeks flying on, off and around aviation training ship Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel Argus. They are the last crews to train on the Mk1 variant of the aircraft before the Merlin Mk2 joins the Fleet Air Arm later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trainees have completed between two and four years of training and instruction both on simulators and on the genuine article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But their stint on the 28,000-tonne training ship - which doubles as the Navy’s casualty treatment vessel in times of war - is their first taste of operating the Merlin, which is the mainstay of the Royal Navy’s anti-submarine and counter-piracy operations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aboard Argus, the trainees go from the basics of landing on and taking off from a flight deck at sea to practising search and rescue drills, then on to tactical missions such as hunting submarines or surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student pilot Sub-Lieutenant Will Legge said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You learn so much more in the real world than you do on a simulation. The real world provides 100 times more variation, things that you can never plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if things go wrong, you cannot just press ‘reset’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Completing the first deck landing is a milestone. You are pretty nervous beforehand, because the deck looks tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Merlin Mk1 helicopter on the aircraft lift of RFA Argus" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5382/Last_training_on_the_Navy_s_Merlin_Mk1_helicopter_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Merlin Mk1 helicopter on the aircraft lift of RFA Argus [Picture: LA(Phot) Dave Sterratt, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea Flight Commander and senior 824 Naval Air Squadron instructor aboard RFA Argus, Lieutenant Commander Mike Currie, said of the five-week training spell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is where we put into practice all that has been taught previously - it is almost the final hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have to have a certain temperament to succeed, a certain Fleet Air Arm ethos, but the pilots, observers, aircrewmen, they are all individuals. There’s no one trait and we’re certainly not trying to produce carbon copies of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Gavin Richardson, 824 Naval Air Squadron’s Commanding Officer, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The embarked period is what the squadron team effort works toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is the crowning glory of a long and arduous road for our students which provides the opportunity to show the investment was worthwhile and that they have metamorphosed into naval aviators, able to operate and fly from that most demanding environment - the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the students come through the training, they will earn their wings in June and go on to join one of three front line Merlin squadrons based at Culdrose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they will be the last of scores of Merlin crews to pass through the squadron and the impressive simulator and training complex at the air station on the Lizard Peninsula since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merlin was originally introduced as a submarine hunter to replace the venerable Sea King. It has since grown into a general purpose helicopter capable of interdicting pirates and drug runners, saving the lives of stricken mariners, and delivering stores and people, as well as fulfilling its original anti-submarine mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first next-generation naval Merlin, the Mk2, arrives in Cornwall this summer. Although outwardly the helicopter is almost identical, inside the cockpit and the command consoles are entirely new:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no comparison with other aircraft out there,” said Lieutenant Commander Currie, who has 1,800 Merlin flying hours under his belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty awesome when it comes to what it can do - especially the variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Things have moved on since the Mk1. It has served us well - and still serves us well - but it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;824 Naval Air Squadron will learn the ins and outs of the new helicopters first before the rest of the Merlin community gets to grip with them and it begins front line deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Last soldier from Fromelles laid to rest in new cemetery</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new cemetery, built near the site of the battle in northern France, was dedicated in the ceremony by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soldiers were recently discovered in mass graves, and yesterday’s ceremony, on the 94th anniversary of the battle, marks the end of a two-year project to give them a fitting final place of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony began when the coffin of the last soldier was borne out of Pheasant Wood, location of the original graves, on a WWI Mark X General Service Wagon pulled by horses from the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procession journeyed through the village of Fromelles, and was joined by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and Her Excellency The Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce, along with Chief of the General Staff, General Sir David Richards, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, Australian Chief of Army, and soldiers from the British and Australian Armies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Minister Lord Astor, who attended the service, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today saw the last of the 250 WWI Battle of Fromelles soldiers honoured with the dignity of an individual burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So far we have been able to identify by name 96 of these soldiers and many others have been confirmed as having served in the Australian and British Army. It is hoped that over the next four years we can determine the names of more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The new Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery at Fromelles, northern France" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5374/Last_soldier_from_Fromelles_laid_to_rest_in_new_cemetery_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery at Fromelles, northern France [Picture: Jon Garrett, Commonwealth War Graves Commission 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service was attended by hundreds of members of British and Australian families whose relatives were killed in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many took part in the service, reading extracts from letters and diaries from those they lost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffin was borne by soldiers from the British and Australian armies, and a joint firing party fired three shots, followed by a one minute silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wreaths were then laid by HRH The Prince of Wales, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, and Monsieur Hubert Falco, the French Minister of State for Defence and Veterans, and the cemetery was dedicated by His Royal Highness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief of the General Staff, General Sir David Richards, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The British and Australian soldiers who fought and died at the Battle of Fromelles faced tremendous adversity. This splendid new cemetery is a moving tribute to them all, and will serve as a reminder of their sacrifice for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HRH The Duke of Kent, President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is right and fitting that these men - comrades, allies, and even two brothers - lie side by side in this beautiful cemetery - the first new war cemetery to be built by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in fifty years. They are lost no longer, and are here at last, at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverend Mitchell Collins from Fife, grandson of Private Mitchell Collins of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment who was killed in the Battle of Fromelles, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My father grew up never having met his father, so the Battle of Fromelles will leave an indelible mark on our family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although we have not yet been able to identify Private Collins as one of the soldiers buried here, I am hoping that over the next few years new evidence will come to light which will help us to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ceremony today was very moving for my family, and a fitting tribute to those who fell in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Fromelles began on 19 July 1916, 19 days after the opening of the Somme campaign, and was the first major battle on the Western Front involving Australian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5th Australian Division suffered losses of 5,533 either killed, wounded, taken prisoner or missing; and the 61st British Division suffered 1,547 similar losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth War Graves Commission’s records suggest that between 19 and 20 July 1916 the Australian dead at Fromelles amounted to 1,780, the British 503.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Last RAF convoy comes home following Libya operations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Stephen met personnel from No 2 Mechanical Transport Squadron (2 MTS) as they arrived back at their base in RAF Wittering, Cambridgeshire. He chatted with the drivers and got a first-hand account of the challenges they faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the two-hour visit, Sir Stephen took the opportunity to drive an Oshkosh Close Support Tanker (adorned with a 4-star plate), before visiting the 2 MTS Operations Room, No 5001 Squadron’s Station Engineering Flight and No 3 Mobile Catering Squadron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Op ELLAMY, the UK operation over Libya, 2 MTS’s vehicles drove 1,169,986 miles (1,882,910km); which is equivalent to travelling around the equator more than 47 times, and carried 8,540 tonnes of freight - the equivalent of 813 Hercules aircraft loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 MTS suffered the only operational fatality of the Operation, with the sad loss of Senior Aircraftman James Smart, who was involved in a Road Traffic Accident as his convoy was transiting through southern Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing personnel, Sir Stephen said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think there’s no question that, without the support units here, whether it be 2 MT, the hangar erectors, the people who keep everything going, and those who keep us fed in various parts of the world recently, we would not have been able to be as effective as we have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His final trip retraced the steps of his first journey with the Squadron more than a decade ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My first encounter with the Squadron was 12 years ago when I travelled down with them to Gioia del Colle, and my last trip with 2 MT was to the same destination,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journeys to and from southern Italy ferried cargoes varying from to explosive ordnance to aircraft wheels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s quite a lonely trip, four days there, four days back,” said Sgt Merrix. “It’s a challenge to do 4,000 miles [6,437km] on your own and maintain the level of concentrations you have to apply. We do stop regularly, but on the continent it can be difficult sometimes to find somewhere to park 10 trucks overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Captain Richard Hill, Station Commander at RAF Wittering, summarised the performance of his personnel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Op ELLAMY represented the first time for many years that the RAF has undertaken an expeditionary operation. The role played by units and personnel from the station was crucial in delivering, at pace and over extended lines of communication, many of the logistics and supporting services necessary to enable the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am extremely proud of the contribution that these personnel have made, and delighted that the Chief of the Air Staff took the time and trouble to visit RAF Wittering and pass on his personal appreciation to a cross-section of the personnel who had been involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Op ELLAMY has again highlighted the importance of logistic support and underlined the role of the RAF’s logistics personnel on deployed operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will continue to refine the level and types of support we provide, and continue to develop/enhance the working relationship we have with Headquarters Air Command, and the Expeditionary Air Wings, such that we are able to meet whatever challenges may arise in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces' contribution to Libya campaign</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a media briefing held earlier today, 27 October, in the Ministry of Defence Main Building, Air Marshal Peach began with a brief narrative of the operation recalling that, in February, as a result of the deterioration of the situation in Libya, there was quite a lot of work for Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) to do in terms of getting entitled persons out of the country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to say about that is to say thank you to the government and the people of Malta for letting us form a base there. In terms of geography, that gave us a special advantage to deal with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PJHQ, under the Air Marshal’s command, is a high-readiness group of people, ready to deploy rapidly around the world when something happens. In this case, they formed a non-combatant evacuation coordination cell, and by doing this avoided the situation where potentially three different countries could have sent three different aircraft in a disorganised way to pick up the same group of people: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a very soft attempt to coordinate across a group of nations who were all trying to do the same thing,” said the Air Marshal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was very successful. It was quite a tough call. We took a risk on the Sunday in particular, when we went deep with a C-130 into the desert. It was uncertain because of the number and nationality of the people there kept fluctuating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the same objective, Type 22 frigate HMS Cumberland was then moved into Benghazi harbour, which the Air Marshal also described as very uncertain at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it was a very successful part of the story, we evacuated 1,400 people out of a total of 4,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An added advantage gained from this operation, known as Op DEFERENCE, was that it built up knowledge of the country and provoked some thinking about what might happen next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were a bit surprised at how quickly things moved on,” said the Air Marshal. “We had the USCR 97 at the end of February, the National Transition Council established 5 March and then the no-fly zone was established. In quick time, some very successful operations were developed leading up to the hand over to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost a maritime embargo was established in which the Royal Navy played a key role with a number of ships and people who understood very well command and control in these situations and how to do boarding and embargo operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The influence of UK officers and men and women in command and control throughout this operation is something we should pay tribute to,” said Air Marshal Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A no-fly zone was quickly established. Having been personally involved in four of these in previous times, the Air Marshal said that, “we know how to do that.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO then took over, naming the operation ‘UNIFIED PROTECTOR’, and set up its HQ in Naples, a traditional NATO control centre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the important features of this operation is the harmony and the importance of the role of Italy,” said Air Marshal Peach, “harmony because the Italian military authorities have been extremely good hosts for the UK, and the importance of the geography is pretty obvious. The amount of support they gave us, bases, fuel, logistics, command and control was and is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In supporting civilians who were being “quite aggressively killed by the Libyan forces,” Air Marshal Peach said that what he wanted to highlight above all was the importance of the precise application of force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We judged, and I continue to judge, that unnecessary damage, or worse, the causing of civilian casualties would be a strategic liability for the campaign. The discipline of the ship, aircraft and helicopter crews are something I want to record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with NATO partners, Apache attack helicopters were introduced, mounted from HMS Ocean, to provide a useful tactical capability and, at the request of the NTC special advisers, “not Special Forces,” were introduced and who played a useful role in supporting the NTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key military objective at this point in addition to protecting civilians from pro-Gaddafi forces was reducing the command and control of the regime to stop the attack on their own people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what was going on inside Libya was a key task throughout, not just along the coastal strip but deep inside the country as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also had some unusual tasks,” said Air Marshal Peach, “which I would not have predicted - for example, guarding Libyan dinars contained in a RAF C17 flown into Benghazi to get the money flowing; done, for obvious reasons, in complete secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Army Air Corps Apache and United States Air Force HH60 helicopters on board HMS Ocean, supporting Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR in the Mediterranean " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5335/UK_forces__contribution_to_Libya_campaign-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Army Air Corps Apache and United States Air Force HH60 helicopters on board HMS Ocean, supporting Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR in the Mediterranean  [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Guy Pool, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Gaddafi regime fell back on traditional homeland areas the fighting in and around Sirte was very difficult as the need for the disciplined application of force was more important than ever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point after all this investment of effort, we were not going to spoil it by being wanton in the application of force. So a number of times we held back, we held off, we made sure that the rules of engagement were strictly followed,” said Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have now reached the point where we are continuing to support operations awaiting direction from the North Atlantic Council, which we expect in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes and lessons that have been identified by PJHQ include precision in the use of weapons which has been, the Air Marshal felt, world class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The accuracy, the consistency, and the predictions of the serviceability of our weapons has been confounded. The British weapons in particular have been world class. The low collateral damage of Brimstone is at the top end of anybody’s inventory in the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this precision, the Air Marshal argued, was not just because the bombs were good, but because of the ways in which the ships crews and the air crews are using and interpreting the rules of engagement, using their weapons in a disciplined way, guided by the AWACS aircrews operating 24-hours-a-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The helicopters that deployed provided the ability to go as deep as 50 miles (80km) inland against a series of military targets. Video footage shows a crew taking out a target with two hellfire missiles; the second being fired and destroying the vehicle after those on the ground had been given time to flee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At no point,” said the Air Marshal, “have British servicemen targeted individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tornados carried British-designed and British-built Brimstone missiles, which proved to be a world class weapon system. The Tornado, although undeniably an old platform, is bang up to date in terms of what’s going on inside the cockpit as far as control software, intelligence and reconnaissance is concerned, the Air Marshal said, and he also praised the ground crews who worked round the clock to make sure the aircraft kept flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a new aircraft is the Typhoon, and the Air Marshal said the aircraft had been adapted to carry weapons such as laser-guided bombs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained that the complimentary way Typhoons worked alongside the Tornados, using their targeting pods to create additional intelligence and reconnaissance, was very important: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Typhoon has been a great success on this operation,” he said. “We have also been very pleased with the way that the Army Air Corps adapted to life on the ocean wave aboard HMS Ocean; a first for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Marshall Peach closed by saying that the UK did not do all this alone, and that the success of the operation had depended on the input of 19 partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-forces-transfer-responsibility-for-security-in-sangin-to-us"/>
    <title>UK forces transfer responsibility for security in Sangin to US</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transfer of authority, first announced by the Defence Secretary in July this year, is the last move in the current rebalancing of ISAF forces across Helmand. It follows an increase in ISAF and Afghan security forces in Helmand over recent months and will ensure an equal distribution of ISAF forces amongst the Afghan population living there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handing over Sangin will allow UK forces to focus their effort in central Helmand where they will continue to deliver effective counter-insurgency operations, working alongside the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces have been in Sangin, a key economic and transport hub, since 2006. Alongside the ANSF, they have provided vital security for the local population on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan, enabling development and preventing the insurgency from using Sangin as a base from which to mount attacks across Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 Commando Royal Marines, currently deployed with 4th Mechanized Brigade, have handed over to the US Marine Corps (USMC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British forces have served in Sangin over the last four years and should be very proud of the achievements they have made in one of the most challenging areas of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The level of sacrifice has been high and we should never forget the many brave troops who have lost their lives in the pursuit of success in an international mission rooted firmly in our own national security in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The handover of Sangin by UK forces represents sound military rationale and reflects the increase of both ISAF and Afghan forces across Helmand over the course of the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops will redeploy to central Helmand in support of ISAF’s main effort, where they will continue to lead the fight against the insurgency and assist in building a stable and secure Afghanistan that can stand on its own two feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Gordon Messenger, the Chief of the Defence Staff’s Strategic Communications Officer, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops redeploying from Sangin are handing over a strong, forward-looking operation which has, over the last four years, ensured that the authority of the Afghan Government exists even in an area that the Taliban regard as their heartland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our troops operating in Sangin have been taking the fight to the Taliban and by doing so have reduced the threat of violence spreading elsewhere. The progress and momentum in central Helmand would not have been possible without their endeavour and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is and will continue to be a challenging area because of its strategic importance to the Afghan Government, ISAF and the insurgency - that is why ISAF forces will remain there to build upon the progress already achieved by UK forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A member of the Police Mentoring Troop during a routine patrol around Sangin's bazaar " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5333/UK_forces_transfer_responsibility_for_security_in_Sangin_to_US-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A member of the Police Mentoring Troop during a routine patrol around Sangin's bazaar  [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Si Ethell, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The transfer of responsibility for Sangin to the USMC is the latest in a series of practical and sensible reconfigurations that have occurred as a result of the significant uplift in ISAF troops in Helmand over the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It allows British forces, with their Danish and Estonian allies, to focus their efforts in the critical central Helmand area, building on the strong momentum that has already been achieved there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Richard Mills, Commander of Regional Command (South West), the military headquarters responsible for Helmand and Nimruz provinces, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UK forces have carved out a solid security bubble that we are moving US forces into. They are leaving solid professional relationships with the people and the ANSF in Sangin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will continue to build on the successes and continue to work with the local population and forces there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being an economic and transport hub, power lines route through Sangin, supplying power from the Kajaki hydroelectric station to central Helmand and Kandahar, and Sangin is one of the most fertile areas in Helmand. Building and maintaining security and governance in Sangin is therefore vital for the long-term stability and development of Helmand and the wider region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sangin has moved forward since 2006 with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the reform of Sangin’s district governance with a new District Governor and senior staff appointed in March 2010. The new Governor is actively working with members of the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team and local community leaders to improve governance in Sangin and win the support of local tribal groupings, some of whom have previously supported the insurgency;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• over 850 shops trading in Sangin’s bazaar, twice as many as summer last year; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the improvement of Route 611 from central Helmand through Sangin to Kajaki - increasing access to agricultural land and markets for local people; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• local administrators, supported by the Provincial Reconstruction Team, working to distribute grain and promote the production of legal alternatives to narcotics; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• trained Afghan medics at the new health clinic, which opened in October 2009, treating 300 patients per week - men, women and children from Sangin and its surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, Commanding Officer of 40 Commando Royal Marines, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s been a hard fight for 40 Commando Royal Marines in Sangin, but we have achieved much. We have sought to protect the local people and have worked hard to support the Afghan National Security Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our partners in the ANA and ANP [Afghan National Police] have improved tremendously. They have provided the security for the District Governor to spread the influence of the Afghan Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bazaar itself, central to the economy of the area, is thriving and a much more bustling place than when we arrived with new shops opening all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is still work to do, and we are confident that our American partners will build on what we have achieved. We have lost brave Marines, but we will do them proud and return home with our heads held high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces will redeploy to central Helmand where they will join their British colleagues who are operating alongside Afghan and other ISAF forces and where the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team is carrying out major governance and socio-economic development projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Governor of Sangin, Mohammad Sharif, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The attitude, service and sacrifice that has been paid by the Royal Marines has been exemplary and has set a very good example for the people of Sangin. As 40 Commando goes, they will be missed by the people of Sangin and they will be in our thoughts and minds forever as we will always remember their hard work and efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK forces support Afghan operation in Lower Gereshk Valley</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operation BIG FISH was planned at a meeting of Afghan security officials including the District Governor and the Chief of Police, which was attended by the Commander of Task Force Helmand, Brigadier Doug Chalmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security shura meets regularly to discuss the district’s security priorities and the allocation of police and army resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Rupert King-Evans, Fire Support Company Commander, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operation was to clear insurgents, IED components and IED-making facilities from the Lower Gereshk Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key point from this operation is that it was an Afghan operation supported by ISAF, and not the other way around. The Afghans planned the operation. We offered advice and, when they requested, we provided support for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task fell to the Afghan National Army (ANA) 3/215 Brigade, led by Brigadier General Sherin Shah. At dawn on the day of the operation, more than 400 Afghan warriors from the brigade flew into the contested area. By conducting several ‘dummy’ landings at various locations, the insurgents were kept on the back foot, and the Afghan forces achieved the element of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan warriors, accompanied by their British advisors, patrolled up the valley, clearing the area of insurgents and searching compounds for weapons and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Major Nathan Love from a Kandak Advisory Training Team said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sheer mass of Afghan force on the ground was enough to deter the enemy and show the people that the Afghans are leading. The Taliban saw this and most of them decided not to fight, so the ANA were able to find 14 of their IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Afghan warrior sweeps for explosive devices during Operation BIG FISH" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5331/UK_forces_support_Afghan_operation_in_Lower_Gereshk_Valley-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An Afghan warrior sweeps for explosive devices during Operation BIG FISH  [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Afghan soldiers searching the area and keeping the local residents safe, it was a point of pride to be leading a major operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jawid Afghanyar, an ANA officer with the 6th Kandak, 3/215 Brigade, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have mine-defusing teams, infantry teams and many others bringing security and peace to the area. It has been a while since the Afghan National Security Forces have been in the area and the people now know that we will help make this area safe and secure, so the people here can continue their work in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British soldiers involved in mentoring the Afghan forces have seen them rise to a very high level of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major King-Evans concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s seriously impressive how well the Afghan Army is operating. They are really swept up. Their low-level tactics, skills and drills are excellent, and they conducted the operation almost as if they were ISAF themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They’ve shown the local population that the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan National Army and Police are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces praised as new command stands up in South West Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes, announced on 21 May, see Regional Command (South West), based in Helmand, overseeing Helmand and Nimruz provinces, while Regional Command (South) [RC(S)], headquartered in Kandahar, continues to control ISAF forces in Kandahar, Daykundi, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the majority of ISAF forces based in southern Afghanistan, the formation of the new headquarters permits commanders in the south to focus on geographically smaller areas, ensure greater partnering between the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and ISAF, and deliver the levels of security required for governance and development to continue to spread in the region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Richard Mills of the United States Marine Corps is in charge of the new Command. He leads a combined force of some 27,000 personnel, with units drawn from eight nations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a distinct privilege for all of us to stand up Regional Command (South West),” he said. “We are truly building on the outstanding work of all that have served here in Helmand and Nimruz provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The establishment of Regional Command (South West) is a natural military progression based on the number of troops serving here and the priority placed on Helmand and Nimruz provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the first time that the US Marine Corps has led an ISAF Regional Command. The British officers serving in my coalition headquarters as well as Task Force Helmand have brought invaluable experience and knowledge to the command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are partnered with ANSF at all levels and conducting joint operations throughout Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tough fighting remains,” he added, “but I see evidence daily of progress that will bring about lasting stability across southern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will be a significant year for the future of Afghanistan. Coalition forces, alongside our Afghan counterparts, will continue to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as it delivers legitimate governance, improved security and lasting economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant General David Rodriguez, Commander of ISAF Joint Command, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The establishment of Regional Command (South West) significantly increases the ability of the Afghan National Security Forces to partner with the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Mills praised the work of British forces in Helmand province:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I remain very much impressed by the momentum and achievements of RC(S) under General Carter,” he said. “My predecessors in the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the British troops of Task Force Helmand have distinguished themselves in the service of the Afghan people here. Because of their efforts, real and tangible progress is being made here every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional Command (South), led by Major General Nick Carter, will continue to direct ISAF operations in the provinces of Kandahar, Zabul, Uruzgan and Daykundi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 30,000 troops continue to operate in RC(S). No troops have been realigned during the formation of the new command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces killed in 2009 remembered at National Memorial Arboretum</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex and Defence Minister Andrew Robathan attended the service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service was led by Bishop John Kirkham and attended by more than 500 family members who walked solemnly past the names of the fallen engraved in the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing those gathered, the Venerable Ray Pentland QHC, Chaplain-in-Chief at the Royal Air Force, described the process of remembrance as ‘very precious and special’, adding that it ‘helps to give us a foundation’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2009 saw the largest number of UK Armed Forces deaths in the last twenty years and the highest number of Army deaths since the Falklands conflict in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces Memorial, dedicated in the presence of Her Majesty The Queen in 2007, is the UK’s tribute to the 16,000 men and women who have been killed on duty or as a result of terrorist action since 1948.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memorial has space for 15,000 further names and one of its most poignant features until now was its remaining blank wall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the number of deaths in 2009, it has been necessary to commence engraving on this wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5328/UK_forces_killed_in_2009_remembered_at_National_Memorial_Arboretum-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today is an important day for the country to recognise those that made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma-Jane Webster, whose fiance, Lance Corporal Richard Brandon, was killed in Afghanistan in September, said the memorial was ‘absolutely spectacular’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s wonderful recognition for what he did and what he believed in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK forces help transform Helmand hospital</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than twelve months ago Gereshk District Hospital was in a poor state; all of the buildings were in need of urgent repair, there were no inpatients, the incinerator was broken, and medical waste littered the hospital grounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), working with a Military Stabilisation Support Team (MSST), has completed 23 renovation projects at the site in Nahr-e Saraj (North).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hospital is now one of the leading medical facilities in Helmand, able to provide treatment to a much larger number of patients from Now Zad and Sangin - more than 20km away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renovated hospital has a 24-hour accident and emergency ward, a maternity wing, and vaccination and dental clinics, as well as a drop-in service for more common ailments. All the services are free to patients thanks to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and non-governmental agencies, who manage the funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Abdul Latif is the Director of Health in Gereshk and has worked at the hospital for the last six years. He has worked closely with the MSST, PRT and GIRoA, and has been the driving force behind the renovation. All of the work has been carried out by Afghan contractors using local materials, and this has helped to boost the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Air Force Sergeant Karen Swallow is from the MSST, part of Task Force Helmand. She says the most significant change at the hospital has been in the maternity facilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Previously the maternity ward was what can only be described as a broom cupboard with two old beds side-by-side. Now, it’s a completely new building with up-to-date facilities giving privacy and respect to the women before, during and after their labour,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="nside the new maternity wing at Gereshk District Hospital " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5326/UK_forces_help_transform_Helmand_hospital-05.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;nside the new maternity wing at Gereshk District Hospital  [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Hamish Burke, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif says as a result they’re seeing more and more mothers at the hospital:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most women give birth at home, but now the new maternity wing offers an ante and postnatal care facility, waiting rooms and bathrooms, and we have three female midwives and one female nurse working at the hospital,” he explained. “Increasingly, more women are taking advantage of the improved medical care rather than risking having their babies at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only the medical facilities that have been upgraded. A new incinerator, designed and built by an Afghan contractor, has been put in place so surgical rubbish is no longer left lying around, posing a health risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen, which previously had no electricity and little equipment, now has lights and utensils, allowing the chef to prepare and store food for inpatients and staff. A new well has also been installed, along with a parking area, a mortuary, a new footpath and repairs to the boundary wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrant Officer Class 2 (Artificer Quarter Master Sergeant) Mike Wright from the MSST said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything has been completed to a high standard by the local contractors, providing a much needed improvement to services for the people of Gereshk. Without the dedication of the staff here to their hospital, the projects there would not have been such a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those treated at the hospital include victims of road traffic accidents, gunshot wounds and mine injuries from either insurgent-laid improvised explosive devices or legacy munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding and better facilities mean that the medical care is no longer constrained to the hospital. Various outreach programmes are also run by the medical teams to ensure that provision is extended to the more rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every day nurses from our hospital travel out into the district taking vaccines and health supplies to those who are unable to reach us. These health workers also spread information about basic hygiene and how important it is. The advice spread by word of mouth reaches far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif and the staff are keen to further expand the hospital and provide even better access to facilities for the local people. Sergeant Swallow is confident this will be achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This project has been the greatest success project which I have been involved in during my time with the MSST,” she said. “Dr Latif and his staff are fully committed to making further changes to the hospital, improving its service in the future. It is obvious that this facility will be sustained well after ISAF troops have vacated Afghanistan, which makes it the success story it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK commits more troops to Balkans peacekeeping mission</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company of soldiers will be based in the UK, ready to deploy at short notice to the region if required as part of EUFOR (European Union Force) Operation ALTHEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation ALTHEA has the backing of a UN mandate and provides a military presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina to help maintain a safe and secure environment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This contribution reflects the UK’s strong political support for EUFOR Operation ALTHEA and our determination to help maintain a safe and secure environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the security situation in the region remains calm and stable, it is essential that we provide EUFOR with the necessary resources to perform the mission’s mandate in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EUFOR provides an important safeguard underpinning stability and ensuring that Bosnia and Herzegovina can continue to make progress on its path towards EU and NATO accession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pledge of more troops in support of Operation ALTHEA will not take place until December in order not to impact on the Armed Forces’ commitment to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR Operation ALTHEA became the legal successor in December 2004 to NATO’s SFOR (Stabilisation Force) mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR has the backing of a UN Chapter VII Mandate and its aim is to ensure continued compliance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the continuance of a safe and secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces help Afghan police hold community party</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 300 people from the local area attended the party, which was organised entirely by the Afghan Uniform Police (AUP), who also provided the security for the event - the largest gathering of its kind in the Babaji area of Lashkar Gah district for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment was in the form of a band and traditional Afghan food was provided and served to the guests by the AUP. The band had travelled from Lashkar Gah and many of the police present had also come from areas outside the Babaji precinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ‘community concert’ marks a milestone in the continued success of the police to provide security and influence in the area. Within the last few months several ISAF checkpoints have been closed or handed over to the Afghan police and the final transition of Babaji to Afghan control is due to take place later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Babaji bazaar, which has been closed for the last two years due to security concerns, has recently reopened - a sign that the local population now feel secure enough to return to a state of normality that has not existed in the region for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money for the event was provided by the Operations Coordination Cell (OCC), run by the Police Monitoring and Advisory Group, which is led by 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment (1 PWRR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Paddy Munns, from 1 PWRR, is the Officer Commanding of OCC Babaji, and in the run up to the event he assisted the AUP precinct commander with planning the concert and the necessary security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day, soldiers from Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (1 YORKS), provided overwatch, but security at the event was provided solely by the Babaji AUP and the day went without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, dancing with Lieutenant Esmeri at the community concert  " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5324/UK_forces_help_Afghan_police_hold_community_party-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, dancing with Lieutenant Esmeri at the community concert [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Munns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was a hugely successful occasion and provided a fantastic opportunity for the police to socialise with the local population and continue to build on the developing relationship between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A gathering of this size hasn’t happened in Babaji for over 10 years, so that is some measure of the success of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The community concert was an excellent opportunity for the AUP, and they did themselves proud by organising the event. The AUP mixed in with the locals - dancing, socialising and serving them lunch. It allowed the AUP to show the people of Babaji that they are professional, competent and are here to serve the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band was hired from Lashkar Gah by the AUP and given a police escort to the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mangal, the band’s frontman, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I usually play at weddings and have never performed at a police-organised party. This is the first time I have seen such an event in Babaji. This would not have been possible during the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those present were the Afghan Government’s interim municipal councillor Haji Abdul Gaffoor and Lieutenant Esmeri, the commander of the Babaji police precinct. Many of the local elders were also present, highlighting the influence of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those members of ISAF present at the concert entered into the spirit of the day with Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1 YORKS, encouraging Lieutenant Esmeri to join him and others dancing in front of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babaji is part of the Lashkar Gah district, the security for which is the responsibility of the Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group aided by Support Company from 1 YORKS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK Battle Backers invited to US Warrior Games</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Games is a competitive Paralympic sporting event for wounded, injured and sick Service personnel and veterans, hosted by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British team will comprise up to 20 athletes from Her Majesty’s Armed Forces, as well as staff from personnel recovery centres and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Headley Court. Their participation is supported and funded by the UK charity, Help for Heroes (H4H). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team will be taking part in friendly competition, as guest athletes, against US Service members and veterans at the event, which will run from 30 April to 5 May 2012, in Colorado Springs, USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Games, presented by Deloitte, was created in 2010 as an introduction to Paralympic sports for wounded, injured and sick Service members and veterans. More than 200 wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women and veterans are expected to compete in seven sports in the 2012 event. The UK team will compete in five sports - archery, cycling, swimming, track and field, and sitting volleyball. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, the Battle Back programme has supported individuals in adaptive sport and adventurous training, which helps wounded, injured and sick Service personnel gain confidence and return to an active life. Battle Back is a Ministry-of-Defence-led initiative in partnership with, and funded by, both Help for Heroes and The Royal British Legion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Royal Marines (left to right) Marine Earl James, Marine Joe Townsend and Corporal John Davis during Wounded Warrior trials held at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, USA, in March 2012 " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5322/UK_Battle_Backers_invited_to_US_Warrior_Games-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 2012 Warrior Games is a fantastic opportunity for our wounded and injured Service personnel to enjoy themselves and reap the benefits of competitive sport. I am delighted that British Forces will again be building on the close relationship we have with our US allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sport is a powerful tool in the recovery of our people. Battle Back allows individuals to focus on what they can achieve, accelerating their physical, psychological and social recovery. I am proud to support these excellent games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryn Parry, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder of Help for Heroes, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At a time when David Cameron has been visiting Barack Obama to further cement the UK’s relationship with the US, as well as to discuss what they have called ‘the next stage phase of the transition’ in Afghanistan, we are delighted that Help for Heroes will support a UK team into such a high profile US event. We know how important sport is in recovery and are delighted to have supported Battle Back since its inception in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is further enhanced through the Battle Back Phoenix programme which is available in the Personnel Recovery Centres for Service personnel and veterans. Our participation in the Warrior Games is significant in raising awareness of the work that takes place worldwide in supporting wounded, injured and sick Service personnel, especially as we approach a busy year in sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO of the USOC, Scott Blackmun, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With our athletes Britain-bound this summer for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, we are excited to host our friends from the UK for this exciting competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Warrior Games truly exemplify the power not just of sport, but of the human spirit. The USOC and our partners at the Department of Defense and Veterans Association are committed to ensuring that physical activity programming is available at the community level for our nation’s heroes to participate in sport.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK Armed Forces score highly at parachuting championships</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The championships, held at the Joint Services Parachute Centre, were won by Major Alastair McCartney, aged 34, from the Royal Logistic Corps, who has now secured a place at the World Championships in Russia this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to winning the overall championships Major McCartney also won the accuracy category and came second in the speed section. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lance Corporal Sean Sutcliffe came second overall, finishing runner up in the distance section and third in accuracy, while Sergeant Wez Westley won the speed and distance events. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrant Officer Class 1 (WO1) Spencer Hogg came third in the distance section and Corporal Stu Storey, who is based at the Joint Services Parachute Centre, was declared the British Forces Germany Champion. They have all been selected to represent Britain at the World Championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven Armed Forces personnel took part in the championships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Championships are open to both military personnel and civilians and are held in Germany because of the centre’s world class facilities which include one of the best parachute landing ponds in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Alastair McCartney " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5320/UK_Armed_Forces_score_highly_at_parachuting_championships-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Alastair McCartney  [Picture: Dominic King, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The championships, in which competitors jump from a height of 5,000 feet (1,500m), consist of three dangerous and complex categories: ‘speed’, in which parachutists nose dive towards the Earth at speeds approaching 100mph (160km/h) before pulling up to glide through a short course as fast as they can; ‘distance’, in which competitors navigate a course for as far as possible; and ‘accuracy’, which includes complex manoeuvres, skimming the surface of a pond and a precision landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major McCartney, who earlier this year was part of a team of soldiers mistaken for UFOs by locals while doing a winged suit jump in the skies over Sennelager, took up parachuting at the age of 16, following in the wake of his parents who are both keen parachutists. He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s an amazing sport - just like running a 100-metre sprint; you have to be athletic in what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to have won. It’s pretty exhilarating and a lot of fun to jump out of a plane and twist your parachute so you come down as fast as possible. It sounds crazy and dangerous but there is a lot of risk management, we prepare well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major McCartney, who has already served in both Iraq and Afghanistan since commissioning in 1996 and is currently learning Pashto for a return to Afghanistan, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Parachuting is a fantastic sport with high pressure where you have to make instant judgements in extreme circumstances. In this sense it is good preparation for army life as soldiers are often put in intense situations when they deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parachuting is one of the most popular adventurous training sports for Armed Forces personnel. It provides a good opportunity to hone important adventurous training skills, enhancing an individual’s ability to withstand the rigours of operations and rapid deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Sebastian Muntz, Officer Commanding the Joint Services Parachute Centre, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The closest thing to jumping out of an armed vehicle into a combat zone is jumping out of a plane with a parachute on your back. It’s an intense and high pressure sport and is an extremely useful character-building exercise for soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be a dangerous sport which is why every competitor has to do at least 1,000 jumps before being allowed to take part in the competition; you have to be confident in yourself as a parachutist and be able to put on a good show. But it’s not all about competing - we would urge anyone who wants to really challenge themselves and likes adventurous training to do a parachuting course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
