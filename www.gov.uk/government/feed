    <title>THINK! Don’t drink drive this Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;THINK! and the Association of Chief Police Officers (&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;) are joining forces to warn drivers that getting behind the wheel after a festive tipple could see them end up behind bars this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting television advert highlighting the consequences of drink driving will be shown throughout December as part of the Department for Transport’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; today also launched its anti-drink and drug driving enforcement campaign, warning that young drivers and people driving the morning after a night of drinking pose a huge risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drivers should be in no doubt that if they get behind the wheel after drinking this Christmas, they risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Christmas should be a time for a celebration not a night in the cells. That is why our TV advert reminds drivers of the consequences of a drink drive conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, 280 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. Our message is clear: Do not let a selfish decision ruin your life or someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt; roads policing lead, Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t drink and drive this Christmas you reduce the risk of killing an innocent person, or yourself. It is really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is an absolute scourge on our society and shameful that in 2012 some drivers fail to realise the impact of drink or drug driving. Next year’s figures could include them or one of their family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, drivers aged between 20 and 24 failed more breath tests than any other age group. This year’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign is aimed at young people who are shown to be consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures.* &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s enforcement campaign targets well-intentioned drivers who do not think they are breaking the law but may be over the legal limit by the time they get into their cars in the morning. Police forces will be taking to roads across the country to stop and check drivers. Those found to be over the limit will face prosecution, which can lead to a jail sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCC Davenport added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some drivers who think they are obeying the law but are in fact breaking it by getting into their cars the morning after a night of drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People may be surprised to hear that last year between the hours of 6am and 11am more than 400 people failed breath tests (or refused to provide a specimen), which is more than those caught for the hour before or after midnight. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drivers need to be aware that regardless of the time of day they are caught, whether they are going to work or taking children to school, they will face the same penalties as someone who has chosen to drink heavily in a pub and driven at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Gifford, Executive Director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is good to see the department re-launching the Christmas drink-drive campaign. This advert reminds drivers that the choice is theirs but the responsibility for the wrong choice will stay with them for years to come. If in doubt, do not try to mix two activities. Stay sober at Christmas and during the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the THINK! campaign, the Department for Transport is currently consulting on a package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers. This includes removing drink drivers’ rights to demand a blood or urine test. This is because evidence shows it is used as a delaying tactic by drivers caught over the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is provisionally estimated that 2011 saw 280 deaths, 1290 serious injuries and 9,990 total casualties directly related to drink driving incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The THINK! Christmas Drink Drive campaign budget totals £783,925 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The THINK! TV advert - Moment of Doubt - will be aired 4 December to 23 December. For a high-resolution copy of the advert contact the Department for Transport’s press office on 020 7944 6898&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;THINK! campaign posters can be downloaded directly from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://think.direct.gov.uk/drink-driving.html"&gt;campaign site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Christmas campaign runs from 1 December 2012 to 1 January 2013 &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Importing and exporting live fish, molluscs and crustacea</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can import live fish, molluscs and/or crustacea into the UK, you must be authorised as an aquaculture production business by the Fish Health Inspectorate (&lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All consignments of fish, molluscs and/or crustacea from outside the European Union (&lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;) need to be accompanied by a health certificate. This is issued by the competent authority in the country of origin and confirms the health status of the fish, molluscs or crustacea in the consignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are importing fish, molluscs and/or crustacea from within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;, your consignments only need to be accompanied by a health certificate if they include species that are susceptible to, or carriers of, a disease controlled in Great Britain (&lt;abbr title="Great Britain"&gt;GB&lt;/abbr&gt;). In both cases you need to notify the appropriate authority before your imports arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide explains the authorisations and documentation you need in order to import live fish, molluscs and/or crustacea. It also gives guidance on what happens if errors occur, and the steps you must take when exporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="authorisation-and-documentation-for-live-fish-mollusc-and-crustacea-importers"&gt;Authorisation and documentation for live fish, mollusc and crustacea importers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone importing live fish, molluscs and crustacea into Great Britain needs to be authorised by the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt;. This includes imports intended for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;farming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relaying&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘put and take’ fisheries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;restocking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open and closed ornamental facilities, including pets and purchases for own collection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;scientific research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;public aquaria and zoos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;spas and medical use (nibble fish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you hold fish, molluscs and/or crustacea on your own site, your application to be authorised may need to include a biosecurity measures plan. For guidance on biosecurity measures plans, you can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Book-Importer-BMP-v2.pdf"&gt;download biosecurity measures guidance for importers from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 453KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorisation is free of charge and you can apply using form AAH2. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-AAH2.pdf"&gt;download &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; form AAH2 from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 51KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="importing-live-fish-mollusc-and-crustacea-from-outside-the-eu"&gt;Importing live fish, mollusc and crustacea from outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries that are not in the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; or a member of the European Free Trade Association (&lt;abbr title="European Free Trade Association"&gt;EFTA&lt;/abbr&gt;) are treated as ‘third countries’ for import purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports of fish, molluscs and/or crustacea from third countries must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the competent authority in the country of origin. The authority must follow model documents issued by the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and will often charge for the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-Coldwater-Cert-13.11.12.pdf" title="Open Health Certificates"&gt;Open certificates&lt;/a&gt; are required for fish, mollusc, crustacean intended for farming, relaying, put and take fisheries, open ornamental facilities and susceptible/ vector species for scientific research or public display.  Stock must originate from a country/ territory permitted by the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-Tropical-Cert-13.11.12.pdf" title="Closed Health Certificates"&gt;Closed certificates&lt;/a&gt; are required for ornamental fish intended for closed facilities, nibble fish for medical/ spa use and non susceptible/ vector species for scientific research or public display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imports that arrive in Great Britain directly from a third country must go through a border inspection post (&lt;abbr title="border inspection post"&gt;BIP&lt;/abbr&gt;) where the health certificate is inspected by Animal Health (&lt;abbr title="Animal Health"&gt;AH&lt;/abbr&gt;). You will need to inform &lt;abbr title="Animal Health"&gt;AH&lt;/abbr&gt; about your import at least one clear working day in advance using a Common Veterinary Entry Document (&lt;abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document"&gt;CVED&lt;/abbr&gt;). You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-CVED-Notification.pdf"&gt;download a &lt;abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document"&gt;CVED&lt;/abbr&gt; notification form from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 67KB)&lt;/a&gt;. For details of the timescales to observe when using a &lt;abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document"&gt;CVED&lt;/abbr&gt; and also for contact details of &lt;abbr title="border inspection posts"&gt;BIPs&lt;/abbr&gt; in Great Britain, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-CVED-Timetable.pdf"&gt;download the &lt;abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document"&gt;CVED&lt;/abbr&gt; timetable for notifications of intended imports from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 35KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="importing-live-fish-molluscs-and-crustacea-from-within-the-eu"&gt;Importing live fish, molluscs and crustacea from within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different rules apply for movements from &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="European Free Trade Association"&gt;EFTA&lt;/abbr&gt; member countries. Health certification is only required if the species being imported is either a vector/carrier of or is susceptible to an &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; controlled disease. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/Fish-Shellfish/FHI/importexport/vectorspecies"&gt;read a list of controlled diseases, and vector and susceptible species on the Scottish Government website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also notify the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; of all movements of fish, molluscs or crustacea into Great Britain from &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="European Free Trade Association"&gt;EFTA&lt;/abbr&gt; member countries using form AAH1, except tropical species for ornamental use. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-AAH1.pdf"&gt;Download &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; form AAH1 from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 265KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey are all part of the UK, they are recognised as separate ‘health zones’ to Great Britain. This means that movements from these areas must be accompanied by any necessary health certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fish-and-shellfish-intended-for-human-consumption"&gt;Fish and shellfish intended for human consumption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you import live or dead fish and shellfish for immediate human consumption or immediate processing for human consumption, your business doesn’t need to be authorised. If your imports are from outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; or consist of fish from another Member State, they will require health and hygiene certification. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports/want_to_import/fisheryproducts/%20"&gt;find out about importing fish and shellfish for human consumption on the Food Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Food Standards Agency"&gt;FSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="additional-import-requirements-and-post-import-controls"&gt;Additional import requirements and post import controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to general import requirements, there are other controls that may be required when importing endangered. And there are also post import controls when you introduce species to UK waters, hold non-native species or export them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="endangered-species"&gt;Endangered species&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some species that are recognised world-wide as being endangered. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (&lt;abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species"&gt;CITES&lt;/abbr&gt;) is an international agreement designed to control the import, export and commercial use of these species. If you want to import any species that are on the &lt;abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species"&gt;CITES&lt;/abbr&gt; list you will need a &lt;abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species"&gt;CITES&lt;/abbr&gt; permit. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalhealth/CITES/"&gt;find out about &lt;abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species"&gt;CITES&lt;/abbr&gt; on the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="additional-controls"&gt;Additional controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain species are controlled by additional licensing regimes after their import. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="/non-native-fish"&gt;non-native crayfish and lobster deposits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="/non-native-crayfish-and-lobster-deposits"&gt;non-native fish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="movement-controls"&gt;Movement controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all introductions of fish into open inland waters in the UK, you must get &lt;a href="/section-30-fish-health-checks"&gt;‘Section 30’ consent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on exporting fish from &lt;abbr title="Great Britain"&gt;GB&lt;/abbr&gt;, there are certain steps you need to take. These depend on whether you are exporting to another &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state or to a country outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="when-importing-errors-occur"&gt;When importing errors occur&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a mistake can occur with the legal process of importing live fish, molluscs and/or crustacea into Great Britain. While the consignment is at a border inspection post an error with the consignment or the accompanying documentation may be identified. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some or all of the documentation may become lost in transit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;errors may occur in the quantity of animals in the consignment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;errors might happen in the accompanying health certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the health certificate may be incomplete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-regulation-23"&gt;What is a Regulation 23?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ‘Regulation 23’ is the name given to a notice issued under Regulation 23(1) of the Trade in Animals and Related Products Regulations 2011. A Regulation 23 allows animals, including fish, molluscs or crustacea, to enter Great Britain even though there has been an error with the import process. It will be issued to prevent a consignment of animals being destroyed, as long as they can be isolated well enough to pose a low health risk to Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="who-is-a-regulation-23-issued-to"&gt;Who is a Regulation 23 issued to?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Regulation 23 is served on the importer of the consignment. This is because they are the person who appears to be in charge of the animals at the time of the importation and when the veterinary checks were made. As an importer, it is your responsibility to make sure that all the terms of the Regulation 23 are complied with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="isolation-of-the-consignment"&gt;Isolation of the consignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Regulation 23 is served, as an importer you will be consulted about where the consignment can be isolated to. This may be a facility run by you or a site operated by a third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All isolation sites must have been approved by the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; and must be totally physically separate. They must have separate equipment and procedures, and the stock must remain in the facility until the Regulation 23 has been released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is your responsibility as the importer to make sure that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any third parties involved are aware of the terms of Regulation 23&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the animals are isolated to prevent the introduction or spread of disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="how-and-when-is-a-regulation-23-released"&gt;How and when is a Regulation 23 released?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a Regulation 23 can be released, you must resolve the problem that led to the Regulation 23 being issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is an error with the health certificate, you must arrange for the certificate to be amended or replaced by the competent authority in the country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If problems with the documentation can’t be resolved, the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; may sample and test the consignment for disease. This involves the sacrifice of a minimum of 30 animals and a delay of between two and three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="if-the-species-are-non-susceptible-tropical-species"&gt;If the species are non-susceptible tropical species&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the species involved aren’t a vector/carrier of or susceptible to a controlled disease, a Regulation 23 won’t be issued for documentation errors. Instead, the consignment will be issued with a Regulation 16 requiring the importer to correct paperwork errors but not requiring the animals to be isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="exporting-fish-molluscs-and-crustacea-from-great-britain"&gt;Exporting fish, molluscs and crustacea from Great Britain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports of live fish, molluscs and crustacea from Great Britain often require health certification. The steps you need to take depend on whether you are exporting to other &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="European Free Trade Association"&gt;EFTA&lt;/abbr&gt; member states or to countries outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="exporting-to-eu-and-efta-countries"&gt;Exporting to &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="European Free Trade Association"&gt;EFTA&lt;/abbr&gt; countries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you export to &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="European Free Trade Association"&gt;EFTA&lt;/abbr&gt; member states, your consignments only need to be accompanied by health certificates if the species you are exporting are susceptible to or vectors of &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; controlled diseases. If they are, you will need to get the consignment inspected by the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; before the health certificate is issued. This is carried out free of charge but you do need to provide five working days notice to the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="exporting-to-countries-outside-the-eu"&gt;Exporting to countries outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements for exporting to countries outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; are set by the competent authority in the country of destination. It is your responsibility as the exporter to find out what the requirements are and to obtain copies of all necessary health certificates, including translations, that must accompany your consignments. You must also clarify who is an acceptable signatory: a qualified veterinarian or fish health specialist, for example. You must provide these certificates to the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; and ensure they are accurate and will be accepted by the destination country’s competent authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; will then decide if your aquaculture production business site can meet the requirements. If they decide that it can’t, they will contact you to discuss the matter further and outline the options available. If your site can’t meet the requirements, you may decide to contact the competent authority to ask them to revise their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; signature is required, and possible, the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; will arrange a visit, as well as discussing charges and issuing with you before they proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fhi-helpline"&gt;

    <title>Non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulations and controls exist to protect native wildlife species and habitats from threats caused by non-native species being introduced. Non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea can carry and spread diseases to which native species have no defence. They can also prey on native species and other animals, and upset the natural ecological balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are special legal controls in the UK to protect native fish, mollusc and crustacea populations from damage caused when non-native varieties are introduced into their habitats. These controls aim to prevent both deliberate and accidental introductions of non-native species by ensuring that only people covered by an appropriate licence can keep or introduce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide explains the regulations and licensing requirements that apply to non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea. It covers the type of licence you need depending on the nature of your business and the species involved, and also explains the application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="legal-controls-for-non-native-fish-mollusc-crustacea-species"&gt;Legal controls for non-native fish, mollusc, crustacea species&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following legislation exists to protect the environment, and native fish, mollusc and crustacea species from the harm caused by unauthorised releases of non-native species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="wildlife-and-countryside-act"&gt;Wildlife and Countryside Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wildlife and Countryside Act (&lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt;) 1981 makes it an offence for anyone without a licence to release a non-native animal into the wild in Great Britain (&lt;abbr title="Great Britain"&gt;GB&lt;/abbr&gt;), or to allow one to escape. For example, it would be an offence under the Act to introduce non-native fish into a pond from which they could potentially escape into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="alien-species-in-aquaculture"&gt;Alien Species in Aquaculture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alien and Locally Absent Species in Aquaculture Regulations 2011 control the use of non-native and locally absent species on farms. Applications are considered in conjunction with &lt;a href="/fish-and-shellfish-farm-authorisation-and-registration" title="APB Authorisation"&gt;authorisation&lt;/a&gt; as an aquaculture production business for the purpose of farming . Each species is assessed against the risk posed and the security of the receiving site. Where the species involved is new to the aquaculture industry in &lt;abbr title="Great Britain"&gt;GB&lt;/abbr&gt; the applicant may be required to present background on the risk posed by the species with their application. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cefas.defra.gov.uk/our-services/aquaculture/fish-health-inspectorate.aspx" title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;Fish Health Inspectorate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt;)  will provide additional information following an enquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="specific-controls-on-fish-and-crayfish"&gt;Specific controls on fish and crayfish&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional legislation exists to provide further protection for native fish and crayfish species. It is an offence for anyone without a licence to keep or introduce crayfish or specific named species of non-native fish into any water in England and Wales, under the Import of Live Fish Act 1980 (&lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt;). ‘Any water’ includes tanks, pools and ponds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1-Leaflet.pdf"&gt;Download a list of controlled non-native fish species from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (&lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt;) website (PDF, 181KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="lobster-deposit-order"&gt;Lobster Deposit Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legislation exists to protect UK lobster stocks by preventing the introduction and spread of non-native lobsters and their diseases. The legislation applies to the following types of lobster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European lobster (Homarus gammarus)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;American or Canadian lobster (Homarus americanus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to introduce or deposit lobsters in the UK – whether they are alive or dead – then you must comply with the legislation and obtain a licence where necessary. There are two types of licence in England and Wales, a general licence and an individual licence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="licences-for-keeping-and-introducing-non-native-fish-mollusc-and-crustacea"&gt;Licences for keeping and introducing non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under legislation designed to protect native fish, mollusc, crustacea and other wildlife, you will need a licence to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep controlled non-native species of fish and crayfish or introduce them into an inland water – because it is granted under the Import of Live Fish (England and Wales) Act (&lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt;), this is known as an &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduce all non-native fish into the wild – because it is granted under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, this is known as a &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;farm non-native or locally absent species – granted under The Alien and Locally Absent Species in Aquaculture Regulations 2011 which are commonly known as the Alien Species Regulation hence an ASR permit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hold lobsters - controlled under the Lobsters (Control of Deposit) Order 1981 and known as lobster deposit licences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="ilfa-licence"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licensing system applies to any non-native fish species listed under the legislation and all crayfish except the red claw crayfish (cherax quadricarinatus). You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1-Leaflet.pdf"&gt;download a list of controlled non-native fish species from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 19KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those wishing to keep the listed species -  including fish dealers, fishery owners, researchers, public display aquariums, wholesalers, retailers and hobbyists - may require an individual licence to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning to introduce non-native fish that are not on the controlled list, or crayfish, you don’t need an &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence, but you may need a &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="wca-licence"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence is required to introduce all non-native species into the wild. If you need to obtain an &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence to introduce a controlled species then that licence will also provide &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; approval. If the species is not on the controlled under &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt;, you only need a &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The wild’ includes fisheries and any other waters where you couldn’t easily recover all examples of an introduced non-native species. Any water from which the fish could escape into an open watercourse, or waters connected to a continuous body of water, is also considered ‘wild’. In general it’s only small, fully enclosed sites from which fish can easily be recovered that are considered not to be the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="asr-permit"&gt;ASR permit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permission to farm non-native species is considered alongside applications to be authorised as an Aquaculture Production Business.  Each species is assessed against the risk posed and the security of the receiving site.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the species involved is new to the aquaculture industry in &lt;abbr title="Great Britain"&gt;GB&lt;/abbr&gt; the applicant may be required to present background on the risk posed by the species with their application.  The &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; will provide additional information following an enquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="lobster-deposit"&gt;Lobster deposit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special legislation exists to protect UK lobster stocks by preventing the introduction and spread of non-native lobsters and their diseases. The legislation applies to the following types of lobster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European lobster (Homarus gammarus)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;American or Canadian lobster (Homarus americanus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to introduce or deposit lobsters in the UK – whether they are alive or dead – then you must comply with the legislation and obtain a licence where necessary. There are two types of licence in England and Wales, a general licence and an individual licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general licence is in place to cover certain situations where lobsters are introduced or deposited. Under its arrangements you don’t need to make an individual application for a licence if you intend to deposit or introduce:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European lobsters that have not been kept in tanks or systems that contain – or have contained – American or Canadian lobsters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;European or Canadian lobsters to be held on the site where they will be consumed, provided that none of the water in which they are held, nor any lobster waste, is discharged into tidal waters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;European or American lobsters that are canned, frozen, or prepared in some other way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;American lobsters deposited at a site that is more than one mile away from tidal waters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you intend to introduce or deposit lobsters in England and Wales in any situation not covered by the general licence above, then you will need an individual licence from the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="section-30-consent"&gt;Section 30 consent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 30 consent
is written consent that you must get from the Environment Agency before you may introduce any fish - including non-native species - into inland waters other than fish farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="crayfish-trapping"&gt;Crayfish trapping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to trap and remove non-native crayfish from waters in England or Wales you can apply for written permission from the Environment Agency. It is also your responsibility to get the necessary consent from the land owner. If the local conditions are suitable then the Environment Agency may grant permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that you cannot re-introduce non-native crayfish that you catch to any waters without a licence to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out about getting permission to trap non-native crayfish on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/fishing/38051.aspx"&gt;Environment Agency website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="which-licence-do-i-need"&gt;Which licence do I need?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The licences that you need in order to keep or introduce non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea depend on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the nature of your business and/or the waters you’re introducing the animals to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether the fish are on the list of controlled non-native species - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1-Leaflet.pdf"&gt;download a list of controlled non-native fish species from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 19KB)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="licences-to-keep-and-introduce-non-native-fish-molluscs-and-crustacea"&gt;Licences to keep and introduce non-native fish, molluscs and crustacea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The licences that you may need to keep and introduce non-native animals may include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the ASR licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lobster deposit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘Section 30’ consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="introducing-and-keeping-non-native-species-in-the-wild-including-fisheries"&gt;Introducing and keeping non-native species in the wild, including fisheries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you introduce controlled non-native fish, molluscs or crustacea species into the wild you will need all of the following licences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an individual &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a Section 30 consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the species you introduce is not on the controlled list, you will need a &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence but not an &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence. Section 30 consent is required for movements of all fish into a river or stillwater fishery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The wild’ includes fisheries and any other waters where all examples of an introduced non-native species could not easily be recovered. Any water from which animals could escape into an open watercourse, or waters connected to a continuous body of water, is also considered ‘wild’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fish-farms"&gt;Fish farms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorised fish, mollusc and crustacea farms may require the following licences to introduce and keep non-native fish to their waters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an ASR permit and a &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence, if the waters the fish are held in are considered to be wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish farms don’t need Section 30 consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="non-native-crayfish-kept-for-direct-supply-for-human-consumption"&gt;Non-native crayfish kept for direct supply for human consumption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general licence exists for outlets like fishmongers and restaurants to allow them to keep non-native crayfish for direct human consumption. They can keep non-native species temporarily before transferring them for human consumption, while hotels and restaurants can keep them to serve to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the crayfish are held securely, and any unused crayfish are dead before disposal, the general licence will cover these activities and you won’t need to make an individual licence application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ornamental-fish-and-crayfish-wholesalers-and-retailers"&gt;Ornamental fish and crayfish wholesalers and retailers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you sell controlled non-native fish species on a wholesale or retail basis you require an individual &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence. The general licensing provisions do not apply in the case of wholesalers and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only species of crayfish permitted in the ornamental trade is the red claw crayfish (cherax quadricarinatus).  Their keeping in heated indoor aquarium is covered by the general licensing terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="garden-ponds-and-ornamental-aquaria"&gt;Garden ponds and ornamental aquaria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General licensing arrangements apply in the following situations, meaning that you don’t need an individual &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence if you keep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grass carp, sturgeon/sterlet and ameiurid (ictalurid) catfish in a garden pond or indoor aquarium&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;red shiners and fathead minnows (roseyreds) in an indoor aquarium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A garden pond means a self-contained and isolated body of water covering no more than one acre on private residential premises. There must be no risk that the fish could escape into the wild, and it must not be used for fishing or any commercial purpose related to fish rearing or dealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep controlled non-native fish in any other situation, including a pond or aquarium in a wholesale or retail outlet, you will need an individual &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="applying-for-your-licence"&gt;Applying for your licence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction and keeping of non-native and locally absent species on fish farms are made and considered in conjunction with farm authorisation.  Applications are made on an &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-AW1.pdf"&gt;AW1 form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to introduce and keep controlled non-native fish species are made on form ILFA1 Download form &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1.pdf" title="ILFA1 Form"&gt;ILFA1&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 88KB).  Where appropriate this application will also cover &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; permissions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to keep non-native crayfish are made on a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-CRAY2.pdf"&gt;CRAY2&lt;/a&gt;  form and where appropriate covers &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to deposit lobsters are made on a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-Lobster-Deposit.pdf"&gt;FIS9&lt;/a&gt; form.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to provide various details on the form, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;information about yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what species the fish are&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;where the fish will come from&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;where the fish will be kept, and key details about the location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the purpose of the introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will only be issued with a licence if the species is considered to be appropriate, and if security at your site is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-long-will-the-licensing-process-take"&gt;How long will the licensing process take?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long it takes for your licence to be processed depends on your business type. If you’re a retailer, hobbyist or wholesaler applying for a licence to trade in ornamental non-native fish then your application will be processed within the timescales set by the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt;. For guidance on how long the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; will take to process your application, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cefas.defra.gov.uk/media/510230/fish-health-inspectorate-cc.pdf"&gt;download the &lt;abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate"&gt;FHI&lt;/abbr&gt; citizen’s charter from the Cefas website (PDF, 51KB)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However other applications can take up to 90 days before a licence is issued, particularly if it’s necessary to consult with organisations such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Environment Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="offences-and-penalties"&gt;Offences and penalties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Prohibition of Keeping or Release of Live Fish (Specified Species) Order 1998 and the Prohibition of Keeping of Live Fish (Crayfish) Order 1996, you’re committing an offence if you hold, keep or release species that are on the &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; list without holding an &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence. It’s also an offence if you fail to meet the conditions of your &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence, including supplying an &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; listed species to someone who doesn’t have an appropriate &lt;abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act"&gt;ILFA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your licence could be revoked if you fail to comply with licence conditions, and you could be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £2,500. Depending on the circumstances, illegally stocked fish may be removed and destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act"&gt;WCA&lt;/abbr&gt; 1981, you’re committing an offence if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deliberately release any non-native fish into the wild&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allow non-native fish to escape into the wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You face a fine if you’re found guilty of this offence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under ASR offences include the abandonment, release or allowing the permitted animals to escape - unless you can provide evidence of the reasonable steps taken to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="applying-for-section-30-consent"&gt;Applying for Section 30 consent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to get Section 30 consent from the Environment Agency before you move any fish into a river or stillwater fishery. See fish movements into inland waters in the guide on &lt;a href="/moving-fish-and-shellfish"&gt;moving fish and shellfish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Classifying computers and software for import and export</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal computer systems, computer servers, laptops and portables (and parts and accessories for these machines) are covered in Chapter 84 and Chapter 85 of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff). These two chapters together make up Section XVI of the Tariff and cover between them a wide range of mechanical, electrical, electronic and other machinery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide will help you to classify computers - including complete systems, individual separate units, parts and accessories - and computer software correctly according to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;their design, build and performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether they’ve got more than one function, including functions unrelated to computers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether they’re part of a complete system or an individual separate unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="quick-reference-table-of-heading-codes"&gt;Quick reference table of heading codes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following list isn’t exhaustive, but it’ll help you check quickly whether or not a particular item of computer hardware or software is likely to be covered in chapters 84 or 85 and tell you the heading code you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Heading code&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;PDA with built-in GPS (Global Positioning System)&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;8517 62 00 90&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3 id="general-interpretative-rules-for-classification-of-computers-and-software"&gt;General Interpretative Rules for classification of computers and software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The General Interpretative Rules (&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rules"&gt;GIRs&lt;/abbr&gt;) of the Tariff provide the legal basis for classifying goods. There are six &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rules"&gt;GIRs&lt;/abbr&gt;, which are set out in Part 1 Section I of the second volume of the Tariff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 1 directs that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A heading code is a four-digit code, while a chapter code is a two-digit code. The terms of the heading descriptions - and the notes to each section and chapter - are paramount when it comes to classifying goods correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 6 determines how goods are classified at the level of a subheading code - a code with six or more digits. So if an item is classified using a code of six or more digits, both &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 6 and &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 1 will always apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 2, &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 3 and &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 4 sometimes also apply, depending on the nature of the goods to be classified. It’s important to note that you must consider each &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; in sequence. For example, you can’t use &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 3c to classify goods until you have tried using &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 2a, &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 2b, &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 3a and &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 3b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 5 applies to certain types of container and to packing materials presented with the items they’re designed to package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guidance notes on interpreting each &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; are included in the &lt;a href="/specialist/classification-of-goods" title="Harmonised System Explanatory Notes to the Tariff"&gt;Harmonised System Explanatory Notes to the Tariff.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="classifying-complete-computers"&gt;Classifying complete computers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items that are classified under heading code 8471 as ‘automatic data processing machines’ - computers - are machines that must be capable of all the following operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;storing the processing programs that run on them - and at least the data that’s needed to run a program&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;being freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;performing arithmetical computations specified by the user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;executing, without human intervention, a processing program for which they need to modify their execution by making logical decisions throughout the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note 5a to Chapter 84 defines the term ‘automatic data processing machine’ for the purposes of heading code 8471. Essentially, goods that are classified as computers must be able to use standard operating software and to perform functions like word processing and spreadsheet applications. They must incorporate a hard disk drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer may take the form of a system made up of several separate units, eg a keyboard, monitor, base unit and so on. With some exceptions, a unit is treated as part of a computer system if it meets all of the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s of a type solely or principally used in a computer system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it can be connected to the central processing unit (&lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt;) either directly or through one or more other units&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it can accept or deliver data in a form usable by the system, such as codes or signals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyboards, X-Y co-ordinate input devices like joysticks and mouse devices, and disk storage units only need to meet the last two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="desktop-and-tower-systems"&gt;Desktop and tower systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard desktop and tower systems must have at least:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt; - the base unit or ‘system box’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an input unit - for example a keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an output unit - for example a monitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also include other units like printers and scanners. Built in ‘extras’ such as network cards and television cards are also treated as part of the system. Desktop and tower computer systems are classified under subheading code 8471 49 00 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="servers"&gt;Servers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network file servers that have both a keyboard and a monitor are, like desktop computer systems, classified under subheading code 8471 49 00 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network file servers that don’t have both a keyboard and a monitor are classified as individual separate units. The base unit itself is classified under subheading code 8471 50 00 90. If a monitor is present (D-sub 15-pin only - not video), then that would be classified separately under subheading code 8528 51 00 00, while a keyboard would be classified separately under subheading code 8471 60 60 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Printer servers and firewall systems aren’t treated as computer servers, but as data communication apparatus. They’re classified under subheading code 8517 62 00 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="small-portable-computers"&gt;Small portable computers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include laptop and notebook computers and personal digital assistants with similar capabilities to laptops. To be classified under subheading code 8471 30 00 00 they must weigh less than 10 kilograms and have at least:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a means of loading programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To classify a portable computer correctly, please also refer to the following item descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="palm-held-portables"&gt;Palm-held portables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are electronic personal organisers that don’t usually have a full keyboard. They generally have pre-defined functions like a diary and an address book. They’re classified under subheading code 8543 70 90 99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="other-portable-computers"&gt;Other portable computers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portable computers that don’t meet the above requirements can include touch screen, luggable and industrial computers. There’s no maximum weight, but they must include at least the following within the same housing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an input unit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an output unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A touch screen usually counts as both an input and an output unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of portable computer are classified under subheading code 8471 41 00 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="classifying-separate-computing-units---monitors-screens-and-projectors"&gt;Classifying separate computing units - monitors, screens and projectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output devices such as monitors, screens and computer projectors are classified as separate units if they don’t make up part of a complete system like a desktop computer. The subheading code under which they’re classified depends mainly on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their type, eg cathode ray tube (&lt;abbr title="cathode ray tube"&gt;CRT&lt;/abbr&gt;) or liquid crystal display (&lt;abbr title="liquid crystal display"&gt;LCD&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;their purpose - for computer output only or dual use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that when computer monitors and projectors are separate units, they’re never classified under heading code 8471.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dual-purpose-crt-monitors"&gt;Dual purpose &lt;abbr title="cathode ray tube"&gt;CRT&lt;/abbr&gt; monitors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual purpose monitors can display signals from a computer and also from other devices, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video and DVD recorders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;television tuners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;camcorders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they can display television pictures, they don’t include a television tuner. These types of dual purpose monitor are often known as video monitors. &lt;abbr title="cathode ray tube"&gt;CRT&lt;/abbr&gt; colour monitors are classified under subheading code 8528 49 35 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="plasma-lcd-and-other-flat-panel-display-monitors"&gt;Plasma, &lt;abbr title="liquid crystal display"&gt;LCD&lt;/abbr&gt; and other flat panel display monitors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to decide whether an &lt;abbr title="liquid crystal display"&gt;LCD&lt;/abbr&gt; monitor is classified as a computer monitor under subheading code 8528 51 00 90, or as an ‘other’ monitor under subheading 8528 59 90. To do this, an overall assessment of the monitor is necessary to take into account the functions performed by the monitor as well as the degree of performance of those functions. This assessment may take into account the connectors present and other features such as aspect ratio or screen size.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="liquid crystal display"&gt;LCD&lt;/abbr&gt; monitors that include a television tuner are classified under subheading code 8528 72 91 00 if they have got a standard aspect ratio (4:3) and under subheading code 8528 72 99 00 if they have got a wide-screen aspect ratio (16:9).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="classifying-internal-upgrades-and-parts"&gt;Classifying internal upgrades and parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many computer parts and accessories are classified under heading code 8473. However some items are treated as complete units, not parts, and classified under other heading codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="parts"&gt;Parts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following items are classified as parts rather than as complete units under heading code 8473.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPUs - 32 bit and 64 bit - are made up of two or more electronic integrated circuits. They may come packaged with certain other components, usually a heatsink and sometimes a cooling fan. Some examples include Intel and AMD Processors. They’re classified under subheading code 8473 30 20 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt; heatsinks on their own are classified under subheading code 8473 30 80 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motherboards that aren’t fully populated with &lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt; and random access memory (RAM) are treated as electronic parts and classified under subheading code 8473 30 20 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer casings - with or without a power supply - are classified under subheading code 8473 30 80 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barebone units usually consist of a computer case, a motherboard and a power supply. They’re classified under subheading code 8473 30 80 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory modules designed for use only, or mainly, with computers and computer units that are classified under heading code 8471 are classified under heading code 8473. Memory modules for use only, or mainly, with apparatus that are classified under a different heading code are themselves classified as part of the apparatus. Memory modules designed for use with a range of apparatus are classified under heading code 8548.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and modules of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology, like single in-line memory module (SIMM) and dual in-line memory module (DIMM), are classified under subheading code 8473 30 20 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other standard memory modules, including non-volatile types like static random access memory (SRAM) modules, are classified under subheading code 8473 30 20 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="complete-units"&gt;Complete units&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following items are classified as complete units rather than as parts under various different heading codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power supply units (PSUs) that are specially made and suitable for use with computer units like base systems or printers are classified under subheading code 8504 40 30 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined &lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt; fan and heatsink units for personal computers are classified under subheading code 8414 59 20 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motherboards that are complete with a &lt;abbr title="central processing unit"&gt;CPU&lt;/abbr&gt; and RAM are treated as a complete computer base unit and classified under subheading code 8471 50 00 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal drives are classified according to the drive type, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optical drives, like CD, DVD and MO, are classified under subheading code 8471 70 30 90 whether they’re read-only or read and write&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hard disk drives, including removable disk drives, are classified under subheading code 8471 70 50 90&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;card readers for semiconductor media are classified under subheading code 8471 70 98 90&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;USB cards and adapters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SCSI (Small computer system interface) and IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) controller cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various other types of computer expansion card are also classified under this subheading code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory modules designed to be used with apparatus other than computers and computer units classified under heading code 8471 are classified under subheading code 8548 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="machines-with-a-specific-function-that-arent-computers"&gt;Machines with a specific function that aren’t computers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some machines work alongside a computer but perform a specific function that isn’t data processing. Others actually incorporate a computer, but once again their specific function isn’t data processing. Examples of the types of specific function that these machines might perform include communication, measuring, checking and control. These function-specific machines may operate on fixed programs and aren’t freely programmable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of machine aren’t classified under heading code 8471, but under the heading code that’s appropriate to the function they perform. If there’s no appropriate heading code, then they’re classified under a residual heading code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note 5e to chapter 84 sets out the legal basis for classifying machines with a specific function that aren’t computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classification guidance also applies to goods that only operate when they’re connected to the central processing unit of a computer - for example a modem or television tuner card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="classifying-computer-parts-and-accessories"&gt;Classifying computer parts and accessories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ‘computer part’ is an integral component of a computer. Various computer parts are classified as separate units if they don’t make up part of a complete computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ‘computer accessory’ gives a computer an additional function, but isn’t an integral component. It’s an interchangeable part or device that’s designed to adapt a machine to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do a particular operation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;perform a particular service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increase its range of operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="classifying-computer-parts"&gt;Classifying computer parts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note 2 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying computer parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many integral computer parts are classified under heading code 8473.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part that’s an integral part of a computer, but is specifically covered by a heading code in chapter 84 or chapter 85, is classified under that heading code. For example, because coaxial cable is specifically covered by heading code 8544, it’s classified under this heading and not as a computer part under heading code 8473. However, there are certain heading codes to which this rule doesn’t apply because they’re designated parts headings. They’re listed in Note 2a to Section XVI and are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8409&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8431&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8448&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8466&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8473&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8487&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8503&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8522&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8529&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8538&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8548&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some parts are suitable for use solely or principally with a particular kind of machine - or with a number of machines classified under the same heading code - but aren’t specifically covered by a heading code in chapter 84 or chapter 85. These are classified either under one of the heading codes listed above or under the same heading code as the machine or machines that they’re suitable for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts that are equally suitable for use solely or principally with goods classified under heading code 8517, and under heading codes 8525 to 8528, are always classified under heading code 8517. This rule is set out in Note 2b to Section XVI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other parts that are suitable for use with a number of machines classified under different heading codes are classified, as appropriate, under one of the following heading codes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8409&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8431&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8448&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8466&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8473&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8503&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8522&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8529&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8538&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If none of the above heading codes is suitable, they’re classified under heading code 8487 or 8548. This rule is set out in Note 2c to Section XVI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="classifying-computer-accessories"&gt;Classifying computer accessories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many computer accessories are classified under heading code 8473, which deals specifically with parts and accessories for machines that include computers. Only a few heading codes in chapter 84 and chapter 85 cover computer accessories. If the item, or items, for which the accessories are intended is classified under a heading code that doesn’t cover accessories, then the accessories themselves are classified elsewhere in the Tariff according to their function or constituent material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="classifying-software"&gt;Classifying software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software classification depends on the media on which it’s been recorded and the nature of the software. Media include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD, DVD, Laserdisc, Minidisc and other laser-read disks. Even though there are differences in the manufacturing and recording - or writing - processes, these are all designed to be read by some kind of laser system once recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;floppy disk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;magnetic tape&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;magnetic stripe cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;memory cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cartridges for video games consoles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of Tariff classification, software categories include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;programs and data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sound recordings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;computer games&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;films, pictures and image files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;games for video games consoles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="programs-and-data"&gt;Programs and data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include word processing programs, spreadsheets, desktop publishing programs, painting or drawing programs, route planners, encyclopaedia, business or phone directories, catalogues, device drivers, system boot-disks and backup disks. Programs and data are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD, DVD, Laserdisc, Minidisc or other laser-read disks then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 45 00&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;magnetic tape then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 33 00&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;floppy disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 31 00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="sound-recordings"&gt;Sound recordings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include music disks, language courses, wildlife recordings, train enthusiasts’ sound bites, talking books and so on. Sound recordings are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minidisc then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 31 00&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any other laser-read disk - for example CD, SACD or DVD - then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 39 00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="computer-games"&gt;Computer games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include flight simulators, ‘shoot ‘em ups’, sports games, car racing games, strategy games and so on for use only on an automatic data processing machine (computer). Computer games are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD, DVD, Laserdisc, Minidisc or other laser-read disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 45 00.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;floppy disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 33 00.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="films-pictures-and-image-files"&gt;Films, pictures and image files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include movies, videos, photo CDs, clip art collections, photo collections and karaoke disks. Films, pictures and image files are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DVD then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 51 00&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any other laser-read disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 59 00&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;floppy disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 33 00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="games-for-video-games-consoles"&gt;Games for video games consoles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are classified according to the media on which they’re recorded. If they’re recorded on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DVD, then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 51 00&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any other laser-read disk, then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 59 00&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cartridges, then they’re classified along with games consoles in chapter 95 under subheading code 9504 10 00 00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="software-on-memory-cards-and-magnetic-stripe-cards"&gt;Software on memory cards and magnetic stripe cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software that’s recorded onto a memory card - for example Compact Flash, Smart Media, Secure Digital (SD), Multimedia Card (MMC), Memory Stick, XD Picture Card, PC Card or PCMCIA Card - is classified under subheading code 8523 51 93 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software that’s recorded onto a magnetic stripe card is classified under subheading code 8523 21 00 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="classifying-blank-media"&gt;Classifying blank media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blank media include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD, DVD, Minidisc and other laser-read disks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flash memory cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;magnetic tapes and disks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;removable hard disks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;micro drives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;floppy disks, floppy disk cookie only and super floppy disks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="cd-dvd-minidisc-and-other-laser-read-disks"&gt;CD, DVD, Minidisc and other laser-read disks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification of blank unrecorded disks can be complicated. Although all of these types of disk are read by laser systems, the recording (writing) systems differ. The disks fall into the following classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD-R disks. These are unrecorded blank disks of ‘Orange Book II’ type that use laser technology for both reading and writing. Orange Book II is the second part of a standard developed by Sony and Philips to define the construction of multisession CDs. CD-R disks are classified under subheading code 8523 40 11 00.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CD-RW disks. These use Phase-change technology for recording and erasing and are classified under subheading code 8523 40 19 00.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blank Minidiscs. These use magnetic optical technology for recording and erasing. They’ve got a magnetic layer and are rigid magnetic disks. Blank Minidiscs are classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other blank magneto-optical disks. These are classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DVD-R disks. The technology of these disks is assumed to be similar to the CD-R disk in that they use laser technology for both reading and writing. DVD-R disks are classified under subheading code 8523 40 13 00.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DVD+RW discs. These use the Phase-change technology for recording and erasing and are classified under subheading code 8523 40 19 00.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="flash-memory-cards"&gt;Flash memory cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cards contain two or more flash memory integrated electronic circuits mounted on a base. There are different types of flash memory card, including Compact Flash, Smart Media, Secure Digital (SD), Multimedia Card (MMC), Memory Stick, XD Picture Card, PC Card and PCMCIA Card. Flash memory cards are classified under subheading code 8523 51 10 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="magnetic-tapes-and-disks"&gt;Magnetic tapes and disks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include compact cassettes, VHS and mini-DV and are classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="removable-hard-disks---disk-only-not-the-complete-drive"&gt;Removable hard disks - disk only, not the complete drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of disk is usually supplied with some software utilities pre-loaded, so it’s classified as recorded software under subheading code 8523 80 10 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="micro-drives"&gt;Micro drives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are miniature hard disk drives for use in a PC card or similar slot. They’re classified under subheading code 8471 70 50 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="floppy-disks"&gt;Floppy disks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include standard floppy disks, floppy disk cookie only and super floppy disks - for example the LS120 type. They’re all classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="difficulty-with-classification"&gt;Difficulty with classification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section XVI of the Tariff, which includes chapter 84 and chapter 85, includes detailed notes covering the goods classified in these chapters. Both chapters also include their own classification notes. When classifying goods in these chapters, you should refer to the notes and decide which, if any, apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="general-interpretative-rules-girs"&gt;General Interpretative Rules (&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rules"&gt;GIRs&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rules"&gt;GIRs&lt;/abbr&gt; in section 1 of the Tariff set out principles for classifying goods. When classifying computers and software, certain &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rules"&gt;GIRs&lt;/abbr&gt; may have particular relevance for goods like dual purpose and composite goods (&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 1), and specially made carrying cases and packaging materials (&lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note 5 to Section XVI defines the term ‘machine’ for the purposes of the Tariff. In this guide, a “machine” means any machinery, plant, equipment, apparatus or appliance referred to in the heading codes within chapter 84 and chapter 85.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Note 5 to chapter 84 defines and describes “automatic data processing machines” - computers - for the purposes of the Tariff. Note 5 also sets out rules for classifying separate individual units of computer systems correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="composite-goods"&gt;Composite goods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some goods consist of several machines fitted together to form a single whole. To classify composite goods like this correctly, first try to establish which machine performs the main function. Then classify the whole item under the heading code for the machine that performs this main function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s not possible to establish which machine in a composite item performs the main function, then the goods are classified according to &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 3c. According to this rule, of all the possible heading codes or subheading codes that could equally apply, the code that comes last in numerical order is used to classify the goods. &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 3c is set out in Part 1 Section I of the second volume of the Tariff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying composite goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="multifunctional-goods"&gt;Multifunctional goods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional goods are machines that are designed to perform two or more complementary or alternative functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To classify a multifunctional machine correctly, first try to establish which is the machine’s main function. If this is possible, the goods are classified under the heading code or subheading code appropriate to that function - as if that were the machine’s only function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s not possible to establish which is the main function, then the goods are classified according to &lt;abbr title="General Interpretative Rule"&gt;GIR&lt;/abbr&gt; 3c as outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying multifunctional goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="individual-components-that-work-together-to-perform-a-single-function"&gt;Individual components that work together to perform a single function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some machines consist of a series of individual components that are intended to contribute together to a clearly defined function covered by one of the heading codes in chapter 84 or chapter 85. The components can be separate or connected by any means such as cables or wireless devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a machine matches this description, then the whole machine is classified under the heading code that’s appropriate to the function it performs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note 4 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying single function goods made up of several components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="magnetic-and-optical-data-readers-writers-and-processors"&gt;Magnetic and optical data readers, writers and processors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading code 8471 includes “magnetic or optical readers, machines for transcribing data onto data media in coded form and machines for processing such data, not elsewhere specified or included”. These products aren’t automatic data processing machines and nor are they units of them, so they don’t have to meet the classification definition of a computer or a computer part. They’re classified under subheading code 8471 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="exclusions-and-exceptions-from-chapters-84-and-85"&gt;Exclusions and exceptions from chapters 84 and 85&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following items aren’t covered in either chapter 84 or chapter 85, even though they may share some characteristics with, or be in some way associated with, certain items of computer hardware or software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain machines which share some or all of the characteristics of a computer system, but which perform a specific function like measuring, checking, controlling or medical tasks. These types of machine are classified in other chapters under heading codes that are appropriate to their specific function, or under residual heading codes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inkjet cartridges without a print head are classified in chapter 39 under subheading code 3923 90 90 00 if they’re empty, and in chapter 32 under subheading code 3215 90 80 10 if they’ve been refilled. Cartridges with a ‘chip’ to measure the ink level are also classified under subheading code 3215 90 80 10.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typewriter ribbons and other similar ribbons. These can be on spools or in cartridges and are classified according to what they’re made of. If they’ve been inked or prepared in some other way for printing they are classified in chapter 96 under heading code 9612.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-electric projection screens are classified in chapter 90 under subheading code 9010 60 00 00.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toys and games, including video games consoles and video game cartridges. Toys and games are covered in chapter 95. (Computer games software for use only on computers, and games software for video games consoles on laser-read disks like CDs and DVDs are, however, covered in chapter 85 under heading code 8523.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clocks and watches are covered in chapter 91. (Mechanical display watches with a built-in flash memory device are, however, classified in chapter 85 under subheading code 8523 90 90.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-digital (photographic film) cameras are covered in chapter 90.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer monitor optical screen filters are covered in chapter 90.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parts for vehicles, aircraft and other transport equipment, which are covered in Section XVII. There are special codes for equipment that’s for use in a civil aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic parts for general use. These could, for example, be made of base metal (like steel screws and bolts, which are covered in chapter 73) or made of plastics (like plastic trunking, which is covered in chapter 39).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More information about the special heading codes for equipment used in civil aircraft is available in Part 11 of Volume 1 of the Tariff at paragraph 11 2 8 or from the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; Tariff Classification Service Enquiry Line on Tel 01702 366 077.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Asset recovery powers for prosecutors: guidance and background note 2009</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance is given by the Secretary of State to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (&lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt;), and by the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, in accordance with section 2A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, the guidance is given by the Attorney General in her capacity as Attorney General for Northern Ireland. In this guidance, as in section 2A, &lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Directors are referred to as ‘relevant authorities’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case where proceeds of crime have been identified but it is not feasible to secure a conviction, or a conviction has been secured but no confiscation order made, relevant authorities should consider using the non conviction-based powers available under the Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reduction of crime is in general best secured by means of criminal investigations and criminal proceedings. However, the non-conviction based asset recovery powers available under the Act can also make an important contribution to the reduction of crime where (i) it is not feasible to secure a conviction, (ii) a conviction is obtained but a confiscation order is not made, or (iii) a relevant authority is of the view that the public interest will be better served by using those powers rather than by seeking a criminal disposal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In any case where proceeds of crime have been identified but it is not feasible to secure a conviction, or a conviction has been secured but no confiscation order made, relevant authorities should consider using the non conviction-based powers available under the Act.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In any case where it appears that a conviction might be secured, relevant authorities will consider whether or not it is in the public interest to conduct a criminal investigation and (at a later stage, if sufficient evidence is obtained) a prosecution. In these circumstances relevant authorities may also consider whether or not the public interest might be better served by using the non conviction-based powers available under the Act, applying the principle that a criminal disposal will generally make the best contribution to the reduction of crime.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any assessment of where the public interest lies should include consideration of all relevant factors. The Code for Crown Prosecutors (in Northern Ireland, the Code for Prosecutors) lists some of the factors that might be relevant in deciding whether or not a prosecution is in the public interest. The same factors might also be relevant in considering, at any stage, whether or not the non conviction-based powers should be used. A vital underlying consideration is the need to retain public confidence in the criminal justice system as a whole, and in the fair and proper use of the non conviction-based powers. In particular, care must be taken not to allow an individual or body corporate to avoid a criminal investigation and prosecution by consenting to the making of a civil recovery order, in circumstances where a criminal disposal would be justified under the overriding principle that the reduction of crime is generally best served by that route, and in accordance with the public interest factors in the relevant prosecutors’ Code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For illustrative purposes only, the following is a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which use of the non-conviction based powers might be appropriate because it is not feasible to secure a conviction:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only known criminality is overseas, and there is no extra-territorial jurisdiction to pursue a criminal case in the courts of England and Wales or Northern Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;there is no identifiable living suspect who is within the jurisdiction or realistically capable of being brought within the jurisdiction&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;proceeds of crime can be identified but cannot be linked to any individual suspect or offence&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a law enforcement authority considers that an investigation could not generate sufficient evidence to create a realistic prospect of conviction&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a criminal investigation has been conducted but the prosecuting authority considers that there is insufficient evidence to create a realistic prospect of conviction&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;a prosecution has been conducted but has not resulted in a conviction&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Again for illustrative purposes only, the following is a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which a conviction is feasible, but use of the non conviction-based powers might better serve the overall public interest:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using non-conviction based powers better meets an urgent need to take action to prevent or stop offending which is causing immediate harm to the public, even though this might limit the availability of evidence for a future prosecution&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;it is not practicable to investigate all of those with a peripheral involvement in the criminality, and a strategic approach must be taken in order to achieve a manageable and successful prosecution&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;civil recovery represents a better deployment of resources to target someone with significant property which cannot be explained by legitimate income.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the offender is being prosecuted in another jurisdiction and is expected to receive a sentence that reflects the totality of the offending, so the public interest does not require a prosecution in this country&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These are examples, and are not intended to include all of the circumstances in which the non conviction-based powers may be used. Every case is different, and must be decided by the relevant authority on its own facts. &lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt; is able to seek advice from the relevant prosecuting authority before making a decision, where necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In using the non conviction-based powers, relevant authorities must have regard to, and seek to minimise, any potential prejudice to a related or potential criminal investigation or criminal proceedings. So far as it is practicable to do so, the relevant authority should:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liaise with any relevant law enforcement and/or prosecuting authorities before exercising any of its operational functions (other than the seizure of cash), in order to enquire whether doing so would prejudice a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings, and give due weight to any advice so received&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;keep under review the extent to which taking, continuing or refraining from any course of action has a potential to prejudice a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings and avoid such prejudice where possible; and&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;ensure where possible that information relevant to a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings is disclosed to the relevant law enforcement or prosecution authority at the earliest practical opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This guidance does not prohibit a criminal investigation by a law enforcement authority being carried out at the same time as a civil recovery and/or tax investigation. Nor does it prevent civil recovery and/or tax proceedings being instituted where a criminal investigation by a law enforcement authority is being carried out at the same time into unrelated criminality, subject to the duty on relevant authorities to seek to minimise prejudice to criminal investigations and proceedings. Similarly this guidance does not prohibit criminal proceedings being instituted or carried on by a prosecuting authority at the same time as a civil recovery and/or tax investigation is carried out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In no circumstances may criminal and civil/tax proceedings be carried on at the same time in relation to the same criminality. Where criminal proceedings have been stayed by a court, or cannot progress for example because the defendant has absconded, they are not being carried on for the purposes of this prohibition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A relevant authority may agree to accept a reduced sum in satisfaction of a civil recovery claim if satisfied that:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sum is reasonable, having regard to all relevant circumstances including the chances of recovering the full amount claimed and the time and public funds likely to be expended in attempting to do so; and&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;accepting the reduced sum would not damage public confidence&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="background-and-summary"&gt;Background and summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following gives the statutory background and purpose of the guidance ‘Asset recovery powers for prosecutors’ - it is not part of the guidance itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="section-2a"&gt;Section 2A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 2A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 requires the Serious Organised Crime Agency and specified prosecuting authorities to exercise their functions under the Act in the way which they consider is best calculated to contribute to the reduction of crime. In accordance with section 2A, the Home Secretary and the Attorney General have given guidance to &lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt; and the prosecuting authorities respectively to assist them in exercising their functions. They must have regard to the guidance in considering what action is best calculated to contribute to the reduction of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of organised crime in the UK is such that law enforcement and prosecuting authorities need to deploy all the legal powers at their disposal intelligently in order to maximise the impact of asset recovery on crime reduction. &lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt; and the prosecuting authorities have a wide discretion as to how they do this, and it is essential that they retain the flexibility to take the best approach to each individual case as it arises. However, there is also a need to ensure that decisions are taken in a principled fashion, with the public interest as the primary consideration. Now that several authorities are entitled to use the civil recovery powers under the Act, there is further benefit in providing a framework of guidance to encourage consistency of approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-powers"&gt;The powers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act creates four asset recovery regimes each of which has its own features which are relevant in considering the best approach to take in any given case:
Confiscation follows conviction for an offence. In making an order the court must decide whether the defendant has a ‘criminal lifestyle’, based on a number of legislative triggers, including specific types of offences. In cases which trigger the criminal lifestyle provisions, the court applies assumptions about property transferred to the defendant in the six years up to the day proceedings were commenced when assessing the “recoverable amount”, unless the assumptions are shown to be incorrect by the defendant or there would be a serious risk of injustice if they were applied. Applying the assumptions may mean that a confiscation order is made in a larger sum than the proceeds of the specific crime for which the offender was convicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the court decides that the offender does not have a criminal lifestyle the court must decide whether the offender has benefited from his particular criminal conduct - the specific crime for which he was convicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the offender fails to pay the confiscation order they may be subject to a sentence of imprisonment (the “default sentence”). This is not an alternative to paying the order, and the order remains extant despite the serving of the default sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil recovery is a form of non conviction-based asset forfeiture which allows for the recovery in civil proceedings before the High Court of property which is, or represents, property obtained through unlawful conduct. Importantly, the proceedings are against the property itself (in rem) rather than against an individual (in person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These proceedings are civil litigation and the civil standard of proof (the balance of probabilities) applies. The court, however, will still require cogent evidence in order to be satisfied that property is on balance more likely to be the proceeds of unlawful conduct than not. To prove that property was obtained through unlawful conduct, it is not necessary to prove the commission of a particular criminal offence by a particular person on a particular occasion. It is sufficient to prove that the property was obtained through offending of a particular type (drug trafficking, fraud etc). This cannot be done solely on the basis that the person holding the property has no identifiable lawful income to warrant their lifestyle. However, the absence of any evidence from the person to explain their lifestyle, or the giving of a false explanation, allows the court to infer that the source of the income was unlawful. As the action is against the property and not the person, the person who holds the assets which are the subject of the order might not be the person who carried out the unlawful conduct, and a civil recovery order is not a conviction or a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost and duration of civil recovery proceedings varies from case to case depending on the circumstances and complexity of the case. Civil recovery proceedings are often, due to their nature, contested and may in certain circumstances involve protracted litigation. In other cases however, an order can be obtained quickly and simply where the other party consents to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash forfeiture generally provides a simple and speedy non conviction-based magistrates’ court procedure for recovering seized criminal cash. Any party wishing to contest the forfeiture must demonstrate to the court that the cash comes from a legitimate source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash forfeiture usually sits outside criminal proceedings. However, a person knowingly having possession of criminal property commits a money laundering offence, so a cash seizure creates the potential for a criminal investigation which may result in the making of a confiscation order in a larger sum than the seized cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminal taxation is also a non conviction-based power, but it does not result in criminal property being recovered. Instead it allows tax to be charged on a person’s income, profits or gains where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that they arise or accrue from criminal conduct on the part of that person or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt; is entitled to exercise the criminal taxation powers under the Act, but &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; retains all its usual powers in respect of taxation. &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; can issue tax assessments against taxpayers who may be linked to criminal activity as a means of disrupting their activity, without making any assertions regarding the link between the income or gain and the criminality. The issuing of a tax assessment by &lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt; or &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; is based on income or gain over a period of up to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-guidance"&gt;The guidance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is required by section 2A, the guidance indicates that the reduction of crime is in general best secured by means of criminal investigations and criminal proceedings. The benefit of investigation with a view to prosecution should always be considered by a law enforcement agency faced with suspected criminality. Where offenders are tried and convicted in the criminal courts, and sentenced in line with the seriousness of the offence, this is generally the best and fairest way to serve the public interest and secure public confidence in the system of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the guidance recognises the contribution to harm reduction that can be made by proper use of the non-criminal powers available under the Act. The guidance requires &lt;abbr title="Serious Organised Crime Agency"&gt;SOCA&lt;/abbr&gt; and the prosecuting authorities to consider using these powers where a criminal disposal is not feasible, and gives examples of the circumstances in which this might occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases where criminal investigation and prosecution is feasible, it may be deemed by the relevant authority that a non-conviction based approach is more desirable, taking into account the overriding considerations of harm reduction and the public interest. This is consistent with the approach taken in the Code for Crown Prosecutors to the decision whether or not to prosecute. The Code provides that a prosecution will usually go ahead unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour, or it appears more appropriate in all the circumstances of the case to divert the defendant from prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidance is intended to remove any perception that the use of civil recovery can only ever be considered after a full criminal investigation has been completed and a decision not to bring a prosecution has been taken. There are circumstances in which the public interest may be best served by an early decision to use civil recovery powers rather than to pursue a criminal investigation. Again, the guidance gives examples. In a case where many people have played a part in a complex criminal enterprise, for instance, the need to ensure that the investigation and any future prosecution is manageable may mean that strategic decisions have to be taken at an early stage about the scope of the investigation. It may better serve the public interest to use civil recovery against peripheral participants who have enabled or facilitated the crime, rather than including them in the criminal investigation. Special care is needed to ensure that any decision not to pursue the normal criminal process can be regarded as reasonable. This is particularly the case where an individual or company consents to the making of a civil recovery order, as the impression might be created that they have avoided criminal liability solely because of their ability to pay the order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to discussing the circumstances in which use of the non conviction-based powers under the Act might be appropriate, the guidance sets out the circumstances in which the different powers may be used concurrently. It also sets out the principles that authorities should apply in considering whether or not to settle civil recovery proceedings for a sum less than that claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Use of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 - This guidance concerns the issues which the Attorney General asks prosecuting authorities in England and Wales to consider before using the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud, in the light of the implementation of the Fraud Act 2006. It may be supplemented by Departmental-specific guidance issued by individual Directors of the prosecuting authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 - When the Fraud Act 2006 comes into force on 15 January 2007, the prosecution will be able to use modem and flexible statutory offences of fraud. The 2006 Act replaces the deception offences contained in the Theft Acts 1968-1996 with a general offence of fraud that can be committed in three ways:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fraud by false representation  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fraud by failing to disclose information  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fraud by abuse of position. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also introduces other offences which can be used in particular circumstances, notably:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new offences to tackle the possess Lon and supply of articles for use in fraud  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new offence of fraudulent trading applicable to sole traders and other businesses not caught by the existing offence in section 458 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 - The new offences are designed to catch behaviour that previously fell through gaps in the Theft Acts and could only be prosecuted as conspiracy to defraud. Indeed the Act is based on a Law Commission report (Cm 5560) which also recommended the abolition of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud. The argument is that the offence is unfairly uncertain, and wide enough to have the potential to catch behaviour that should not be criminal. Furthermore it can seem anomalous that what is legal if performed by one person should be criminal if performed by many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 - However, consultations showed a widespread view in favour of retention of common jaw conspiracy to defraud, and the Government decided to retain it for the meantime, but accepted the case for considering repeal in the longer term. Whether there is a continuing need for retention of the common law offence is one of the issues that will be addressed in the Home Office review of the operation of the Fraud Act 2006, which will take place 3 years after its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 - In 2003, 14,928 defendants were proceeded against in England and Wales for crimes of fraud; 1018 of these were charged with the common law crime of conspiracy to defraud of which 44% were found guilty (compared with 71% for the statutory fraud offences). The expectation now is that the common law offence will be used to a significantly lesser extent once the Fraud Act 2006 has come into force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="issues-to-be-considered-in-using-the-common-law-offence"&gt;Issues to be considered in using the common law offence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 - In selecting charges in fraud cases, the prosecutor should first consider: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether the behaviour could be prosecuted under statute - whether under the Fraud Act 2006 or another Act or as a statutory conspiracy  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether the available statutory charges adequately reflect the gravity of the offence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 - Statutory conspiracy to commit a substantive offence should be charged if the alleged agreement satisfies the definition in section I of the Criminal Law Act 1977, provided that there is no wider dishonest objective that would be Important to the presentation of the prosecution case in reflecting the gravity of the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 - Section 12 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 provides that common law conspiracy to defraud may be charged even if the conduct agreed upon wiJ1 involve the commission of a statutory offence. However, Lord Bingham said in R v Rimmington and R v Goldstein [(2005) UKHL 63]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would not go to the length of holding that conduct may never be lawfully prosecuted as a generally expressed common law crime where it falls within the terms of a specific statutory provision, but good practice and respect for the primacy of statute do in my judgment require that conduct falling within the terms of a specific statutory provision should be prosecuted under that provision unless there is good reason for doing otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 - In the Attorney General’s view the common law charge may still be appropriate in the type of cases set out in paragraphs 12 - 15, but in order to understand the  circumstances under which conspiracy to defraud is used prosecutors should make a record of the reasons for preferring that charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="records-of-decisions"&gt;Records of decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 - Where a charge of common law conspiracy to defraud is proposed the case lawyer must consider and set out in writing in the review note:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much such a charge will add to the amount of evidence likely to be called both by the prosecution and the defence  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the justification for using the charge, and why specific statutory offences are inadequate or otherwise inappropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, and before charge, the use of this charge should be specifically approved by a supervising lawyer experienced in fraud cases. Equivalent procedures to ensure proper consideration of the charge and recording of the decision should be applied by all prosecuting authorities in their case review processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11 - Information from these records will be collected retrospectively for the review to be conducted in 3 years. It will enable the identification of where and why the common law offence has been used. It could then also form the basis for any future work on whether. and if so how, to replace the common law or whether it can simply and safely be repealed. It is expected that in 3 years the Government will be able to review the situation in the light of the practical operation not only of the new fraud offences, but of other relevant changes. These include the Lord Chief Justice’s protocol on the control and management of heavy fraud cases, and the sample count provisions in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. Any actual or proposed changes to the 1o.w on assisting and encouraging crime in the light of the Law Commission’s study of that issue [Cm 6878, published in July 2006] will also be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a---conduct-that-can-more-effectively-be-prosecuted-as-conspiracy-to-defraud"&gt;A - Conduct that can more effectively be prosecuted as conspiracy to defraud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 - There may be cases where the interests of justice can only be served by presenting to a court an overall picture which cannot be achieved by charging a series of substantive offences or statutory conspiracies. Typically, such cases will involve some, but not necessarily all of the following:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;evidence of several significant but different kinds of criminality  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;several jurisdictions  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;different types of victims, e.g. individuals, banks, website administrators, credit card companies  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organised crime networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 - The proper presentation of such cases as statutory conspiracies could lead to:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large numbers of separate counts to reflect the different conspiracies  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;severed trials for single or discrete groups of conspiracies  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evidence in one severed trial being deemed inadmissible in another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;14 - If so, the consequences might be that no one court would receive a cohesive picture of the whole case which would allow sentencing on a proper basis. In contrast a single count of common law conspiracy to defraud might, in such circumstances, reflect the nature and extent of criminal conduct in a way that prosecuting the underlying statutory offences or conspiracies would fall to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="b---conduct-that-can-only-be-prosecuted-as-conspiracy-to-defraud"&gt;B - Conduct that can only be prosecuted as conspiracy to defraud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 - Examples of such conduct might include but arc not restricted to agreements to the following courses of action:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dishonest obtaining of land and other property which cannot be stolen such as intellectual property not protected by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and the Trademarks Act 1994, and other confidential information - the Fraud Act will bite where there is intent to make a gain or cause a loss through false representation, failure to disclose information where there is a legal obligation to do so, or the abuse of position  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dishonestly infringing another’s right; for example the dishonest  exploitation of another’s patent in the absence of a legal duty to disclose information about its existence  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;where it is intended that the final offence be committed by someone outside the conspiracy  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cases where the accused cannot be proved to have had the necessary degree of knowledge of the substantive offence to be perpetrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Plea discussions in cases of serious or complex fraud</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-foreward"&gt;A. Foreward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A1.  	These Guidelines set out a process by which a prosecutor may discuss an allegation of serious or complex fraud with a person who he or she is prosecuting or expects to prosecute, or with that person’s legal representative. They come into force on the 5th day of May 2009 and apply to plea discussions initiated on or after that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A2. 	The Guidelines will be followed by all prosecutors in England and Wales when conducting plea discussions in cases of serious or complex fraud. For the purposes of the Guidelines, fraud means any financial, fiscal or commercial misconduct or corruption which is contrary to the criminal law. Fraud may be serious or complex if at least two of the following factors are present:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount obtained or intended to be obtained is alleged to exceed £500,000  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there is a significant international dimension  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the case requires specialised knowledge of financial, commercial, fiscal or regulatory matters such as the operation of markets, banking systems, trusts or tax regimes  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the case involves allegations of fraudulent activity against numerous victims  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the case involves an allegation of substantial and significant fraud on a public body  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the case is likely to be of widespread public concern  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the alleged misconduct endangered the economic well-being of the UK, for example by undermining confidence in financial markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking account of these matters, it is for the prosecutor to decide whether or not a case is one of fraud, and whether or not it is serious or complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A3.  	The decision whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence rests with the prosecutor. In selecting the appropriate charge or charges, the prosecutor applies principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors (“the Code”). Charges should reflect the seriousness and extent of the offending, give the court adequate sentencing powers and enable the case to be presented in a clear and simple way. The Code also states that prosecutors should not go ahead with more charges to encourage a defendant to plead guilty to a few; equally, prosecutors should not charge a more serious offence to encourage a defendant to plead to a less serious one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A4.  	Once proceedings are instituted, the accused may plead guilty to all of the charges selected. If the defendant will plead guilty to some, but not all, of the charges or to a different, possibly less serious charge, the Code states that a prosecutor is entitled to accept such pleas if he or she assesses that the court could still pass an adequate sentence. In taking these decisions the prosecutor also applies the Attorney General’s Guidelines on the Acceptance of Pleas and the Prosecutor’s Role in the Sentencing Exercise (“the Acceptance of Pleas Guidelines”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A5. 	The purpose of plea discussions is to narrow the issues in the case with a view to reaching a just outcome at the earliest possible time, including the possibility of reaching an agreement about acceptable pleas of guilty and preparing a joint submission as to sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A6. 	The potential benefits of plea discussions are that:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;early resolution of the case may reduce the anxiety and uncertainty for victims and witnesses, and provide earlier clarity for accused persons who admit their guilt (subject to the court’s power to reject the agreement)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the issues in dispute may be narrowed so that even if the case proceeds to trial, it can be managed more efficiently in accordance with Rule 3.2 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 - if pleas are agreed, litigation can be kept to a minimum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A7.  	Where plea discussions take place prior to the commencement of proceedings, the charges brought by the prosecutor will reflect those agreed, rather than those that the prosecutor would necessarily have preferred if no agreement had been reached. Also, any criminal investigation may not be complete when these discussions take place. For these reasons it is important that the procedures followed should command public and judicial confidence; that any agreement reached is reasonable, fair and just; that there are safeguards to ensure that defendants are not under improper pressure to make admissions; and that there are proper records of discussions that have taken place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A8.  	The Guidelines are not intended to prevent or discourage existing practices by which prosecutors and prosecuting advocates discuss cases with defence legal representatives after charge, in order to narrow the issues or to agree a basis of plea. Neither do they affect the existing practice of judicial sentence indications at the plea and case management hearing or later in accordance with the guidance in R v Goodyear (Karl) [2005] EWCA 888 (see also the Acceptance of Pleas Guidelines). They complement, and do not detract from or replace, the Code and the Acceptance of Pleas Guidelines, or any other relevant guidance such as the Prosecutor’s Pledge, the Victim’s Charter and the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A9.  	Where a plea agreement is reached, it remains entirely a matter for the court to decide how to deal with the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="b-general-principles"&gt;B. General principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B1. 	In conducting plea discussions and presenting a plea agreement to the court, the prosecutor must act openly, fairly and in the interests of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B2. 	Acting in the interests of justice means ensuring that the plea agreement reflects the seriousness and extent of the offending, gives the court adequate sentencing powers, and enables the court, the public and the victims to have confidence in the outcome. The prosecutor must consider carefully the impact of a proposed plea or basis of plea on the community and the victim, and on the prospects of successfully prosecuting any other person implicated in the offending. The prosecutor must not agree to a reduced basis of plea which is misleading, untrue or illogical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B3. 	Acting fairly means respecting the rights of the defendant and of any other person who is being or may be prosecuted in relation to the offending. The prosecutor must not put improper pressure on a defendant in the course of plea discussions, for example by exaggerating the strength of the case in order to persuade the defendant to plead guilty, or to plead guilty on a particular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B4.  	Acting openly means being transparent with the defendant, the victim and the court. The prosecutor must:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that a full and accurate record of the plea discussions is prepared and retained  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure that the defendant has sufficient information to enable him or her to play an informed part in the plea discussions  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;communicate with the victim before accepting a reduced basis of plea, wherever it is practicable to do so, so that the position can be explained  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensure that the plea agreement placed before the court fully and fairly reflects the matters agreed - the prosecutor must not agree additional matters with the defendant which are not recorded in the plea agreement and made known to the court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="c-initiating-plea-discussions"&gt;C. Initiating plea discussions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="when-and-with-whom-discussions-should-be-initiated-and-conducted"&gt;When and with whom discussions should be initiated and conducted&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C1. 	Where he or she believes it advantageous to do so, the prosecutor may initiate plea discussions with any person who is being prosecuted or investigated with a view to prosecution in connection with a serious or complex fraud, and who is legally represented. The prosecutor will not initiate plea discussions with a defendant who is not legally represented. If the prosecutor receives an approach from such a defendant, he or she may enter into discussions if satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C2.  	Where proceedings have not yet been instituted, the prosecutor should not initiate plea discussions until he or she and the investigating officer are satisfied that the suspect’s criminality is known. This will not usually be the case until after the suspect has been interviewed under caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C3.  	The prosecutor should be alert to any attempt by the defendant to use plea discussions as a means of delaying the investigation or prosecution, and should not initiate or continue discussions where the defendant’s commitment to the process is in doubt. The prosecutor should ensure that the position is preserved during plea discussions by, for example, restraining assets in anticipation of the making of a confiscation order. Where a defendant declines to take part in plea discussions, the prosecutor should not make a second approach unless there is a material change in circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="invitation-letter"&gt;Invitation letter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C4.  	In order to initiate the plea discussions, the prosecutor will send the defendant’s representatives a letter which: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asks whether the defence wish to enter into discussions in accordance with these Guidelines  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sets a deadline for a response from the defence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="terms-and-conditions-letter"&gt;Terms and conditions letter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C5.  Where the defence agree to engage in plea discussions, the prosecutor should send them a letter setting out the way in which the discussions will be conducted. This letter should deal with:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the confidentiality of information provided by the prosecutor and defendant in the course of the plea discussions  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the use which may be made by the prosecutor of information provided by the defendant  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the practical means by which the discussions will be conducted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="confidentiality-and-use-of-information"&gt;Confidentiality and use of information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C6.  	In relation to confidentiality, the prosecutor will indicate that he or she intends to provide an undertaking to the effect that the fact that the defendant has taken part in the plea discussions, and any information provided by the defence in the course of the plea discussions will be treated as confidential and will not be disclosed to any other party other than for the purposes of the plea discussions and plea agreement (applying these Guidelines), or as required by law. The undertaking will make it clear that the law in relation to the disclosure of unused material may require the prosecutor to provide information about the plea discussions to another defendant in criminal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C7.  	The prosecutor will require the defendant’s legal representative to provide an undertaking to the effect that information provided by the prosecutor in the course of the plea discussions will be treated as confidential and will not be disclosed to any other party, other than for the purposes of the plea discussion and plea agreement or as required by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C8.  	In relation to the use of information, the prosecutor will indicate that he or she intends to undertake not to rely upon the fact that the defendant has taken part in the plea discussions, or any information provided by the defendant in the course of the discussions, as evidence in any prosecution of that defendant for the offences under investigation, should the discussions fail. However, this undertaking will make it clear that the prosecutor is not prevented from:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relying upon a concluded and signed plea agreement as confession evidence or as admissions  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relying upon any evidence obtained from enquiries made as a result of the provision of information by the defendant  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relying upon information provided by the defendant as evidence against him or her in any prosecution for an offence other than the fraud which is the subject of the plea discussion and any offence which is consequent upon it, such as money laundering  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relying upon information provided by the defendant in a prosecution of any other person for any offence (so far as the rules of evidence allow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;C9.  	In exceptional circumstances the prosecutor may agree to different terms regarding the confidentiality and use of information. However, the prosecutor must not surrender the ability to rely upon a concluded and signed plea agreement as evidence against the defendant. The prosecutor may reserve the right to bring other charges (additional to those to which the defendant has indicated a willingness to plead guilty) in specific circumstances, for example if substantial new information comes to light at a later stage, the plea agreement is rejected by the court, or the defendant fails to honour the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C10.  Until the issues of confidentiality and use of information have been agreed to the satisfaction of both parties, and the agreement reflected in signed undertakings, the prosecutor must not continue with the substantive plea discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="d-conducting-plea-discussions"&gt;D. Conducting plea discussions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statement-of-case"&gt;Statement of case&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D1. 	Where plea discussions take place prior to proceedings being instituted, the prosecutor will provide a statement of case to the defence. This is a written summary of the nature of the allegation against the suspect and the evidence which has been obtained, or is expected to be obtained, to support it. The statement of case should include a list of the proposed charges. Material in support of the statement of case may also be provided, whether or not in the form of admissible evidence. However, the prosecutor is not obliged to reveal to the suspect all of the information or evidence supporting his case, provided that this does not mislead the suspect to his or her prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2. 	Where plea discussions are initiated after proceedings have been commenced, but before the prosecutor has provided the defence with a case summary or opening note, the prosecutor may provide a statement of case to assist the defendant in understanding the evidence and identifying the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="unused-material"&gt;Unused material&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D3. 	These Guidelines do not affect the prosecutor’s existing duties in relation to the disclosure of unused material. Where plea discussions take place prior to the institution of proceedings, the prosecutor should ensure that the suspect is not misled as to the strength of the prosecution case. It will not usually be necessary to provide copies of unused material in order to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="conducting-and-recording-the-discussions"&gt;Conducting and recording the discussions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D4.  	Having provided the defence with the statement of case and supporting material, the parties will then be in a position to conduct the plea discussion proper. Whether this is done by correspondence, by face-to-face meetings or by a combination of the two is a matter for the parties to decide in the individual case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D5. 	It is essential that a full written record is kept of every key action and event in the discussion process, including details of every offer or concession made by each party, and the reasons for every decision taken by the prosecutor. Meetings between the parties should be minuted and the minutes agreed and signed. Particular care should be taken where the defendant is not legally represented. The prosecutor should only meet with a defendant who is not legally represented if the defendant agrees to the meeting being recorded, or to the presence of an independent third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="queens-evidence"&gt;Queen’s Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D6.  	If the defendant offers at any stage to provide information, or to give evidence about the criminal activities of others, any such offer will be dealt with in accordance with sections 71 to 75 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (“SOCPA”), the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v P, R v Blackburn [2007] EWCA Crim 2290 and the guidance agreed and issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="discussion-of-pleas"&gt;Discussion of pleas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D7.  	In deciding whether or not to accept an offer by the defendant to plead guilty, the prosecutor will follow sections 7 and 10 of the Code relating to the selection of charges and the acceptance of guilty pleas. The prosecutor should ensure that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the charges reflect the seriousness and extent of the offending  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they give the court adequate powers to sentence and impose appropriate post-conviction orders  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they enable the case to be presented in a clear and simple way (bearing in mind that many cases of fraud are necessarily complex)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the basis of plea enables the court to pass a sentence that matches the seriousness of the offending, particularly if there are aggravating features  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the interests of the victim, and where possible any views expressed by the victim, are taken into account when deciding whether it is in the public interest to accept the plea  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the investigating officer is fully appraised of developments in the plea discussions and his or her views are taken into account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;D8. 	In reaching an agreement on pleas, the parties should resolve any factual issues necessary to allow the court to sentence the defendant on a clear, fair and accurate basis. Before agreeing to proposed pleas, the prosecutor should satisfy him or herself that the Full Code Test as set out in the Code will be made out in respect of each charge. In considering whether the evidential stage of the test will be met, the prosecutor should assume that the offender will sign a plea agreement amounting to an admission to the charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="discussion-of-sentence"&gt;Discussion of sentence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D9.  	Where agreement is reached as to pleas, the parties should discuss the appropriate sentence with a view to presenting a joint written submission to the court. This document should list the aggravating and mitigating features arising from the agreed facts, set out any personal mitigation available to the defendant, and refer to any relevant sentencing guidelines or authorities. In the light of all of these factors, it should make submissions as to the applicable sentencing range in the relevant guideline. The prosecutor must ensure that the submissions are realistic, taking full account of all relevant material and considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D10. 	The prosecutor should bear in mind all of the powers of the court, and seek to include in the joint submission any relevant ancillary orders. It is particularly desirable that measures should be included that achieve redress for victims (such as compensation orders) and protection for the public (such as directors’ disqualification orders, serious crime prevention orders or financial reporting orders).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D11. 	Due regard should be had to the court’s asset recovery powers and the desirability of using these powers both as a deterrent to others and as a means of preventing the defendant from benefiting from the proceeds of crime or funding future offending. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 requires the Crown Court to proceed to the making of a confiscation order against a convicted defendant who has benefited from his criminal conduct where the prosecutor asks the court to do so, or the court believes that it is appropriate to do so. Fraud is an acquisitive crime, and the expectation in a fraud case should be that a confiscation order will be sought by the prosecutor reflecting the full benefit to the defendant. However, in doing so it is open to the prosecutor to take a realistic view of the likely approach of the court to the determination of any points in dispute (such as the interest of a third party in any property).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D12.  In the course of the plea discussions the prosecutor must make it clear to the defence that the joint submission as to sentence (including confiscation) is not binding on the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="liaison-with-another-prosecutor-or-regulator"&gt;Liaison with another prosecutor or regulator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D13.  The prosecutor may become aware that another prosecuting authority or regulatory body (either in England and Wales or elsewhere) has an interest in the defendant. The prosecutor should liaise with the other agency, in accordance with the Prosecutors’ Convention and any other relevant agreement or guidance. The other agency may wish to take part in the plea discussions, or they may authorise the prosecutor to discuss with the defendant the matters which they are interested in, with a view to resolving all matters in one plea agreement. The prosecutor should warn the defendant that a plea agreement will not bind any other agency which is not a party to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="e-the-written-plea-agreement"&gt;E. The written plea agreement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E1. 	All matters agreed between the prosecutor and the defence must be reduced to writing as a plea agreement and signed by both parties. The plea agreement will include:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a list of the charges  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a statement of the facts  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a declaration, signed by the defendant personally, to the effect that he or she accepts the stated facts and admits he or she is guilty of the agreed charges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;E2. 	Any agreement under the SOCPA regarding the giving of assistance to the prosecutor by the defendant should be in a separate document accompanying the plea agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E3.  	Once a plea agreement is signed in a case where proceedings have not yet been commenced, the prosecutor will review the case in accordance with the Code and, assuming the evidential stage of the Full Code Test is satisfied on the basis of the signed plea agreement and the other available evidence, will arrange for proceedings to be instituted by summons or charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E4.  	In advance of the defendant’s first appearance in the Crown Court, the prosecutor should send the court sufficient material to allow the judge to understand the facts of the case and the history of the plea discussions, to assess whether the plea agreement is fair and in the interests of justice, and to decide the appropriate sentence. This will include:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the signed plea agreement  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a joint submission as to sentence and sentencing considerations  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any relevant sentencing guidelines or authorities  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;all of the material provided by the prosecution to the defendant in the course of the plea discussions  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any material provided by the defendant to the prosecution, such as documents relating to personal mitigation  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the minutes of any meetings between the parties and any correspondence generated in the plea discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;E5.  	It will then be for the court to decide how to deal with the plea agreement. In particular, the court retains an absolute discretion as to whether or not it sentences in accordance with the joint submission from the parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="f--failure-of-plea-discussions"&gt;F.  Failure of plea discussions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F1. 	There are several circumstances in which plea discussions may result in an outcome other than the defendant pleading guilty in accordance with a plea agreement. The prosecutor or the defendant may break off the discussions. They may be unable to reach an agreement. They may reach an agreement, but intervening events may lead the prosecutor to decide that proceedings should not be instituted. Proceedings may be instituted but the court may reject the plea agreement. The defendant may decline to plead guilty in accordance with the plea agreement, either as a result of a sentence indication given under the procedure set out in R v Goodyear, or for some other reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F2.  	If any of these situations arises, the prosecutor may wish for further enquiries to be made with a view to bringing or completing proceedings against the defendant. If proceedings have already been instituted, the prosecutor will use the appropriate means to delay them – either discontinuing under section 23 or 23A of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 or (if the indictment has already been preferred) applying for an adjournment or stay of the proceedings. The prosecutor and the defendant’s representatives will continue to be bound by the preliminary undertakings made in relation to the confidentiality and use of information provided in the course of the plea discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F3.  	Where plea discussions have broken down for any reason, it will be rare that the prosecutor will wish to re-open them, but he or she may do so if there is a material change in circumstances which warrants it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Firefighters' pension scheme: increases to employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statutory consultation seeks views on the proposed increase in employee contribution rates from 1 April 2013 for members of the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (1992) and New Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also considered the impact of the proposed 2013 to 2014 pension contribution increases on protected groups (like older scheme members, those on maternity leave or part time workers) and this is set out in the partial equality statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
