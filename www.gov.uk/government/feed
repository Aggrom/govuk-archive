    <title>A plain English guide to business rates retention</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-are-we-changing-the-system"&gt;Why are we changing the system?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government wants to give councils more freedoms and flexibilities. This is because we want to reduce Whitehall interference and give more power to local people. We also want to give councils stronger incentives to create and support local jobs and local firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local government finance system is one of the most centralised in the world with councils getting more than half of their income from a central government grant. Under the existing system all businesses - shops, offices, warehouses and factories - pay a tax to their local council (called business rates). Although the local council collects the bills, it doesn’t keep the money. It goes into a Treasury pot and is then redistributed back to local authorities, via an extremely complex formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of problems with the current scheme. It fails to reward local authorities for increasing new business in their area. No matter how many new businesses start up in their locality, councils don’t get a penny extra. They could even lose out by having to provide additional services to new companies. Instead of encouraging businesses, the system encourages a ‘begging bowl’ mentality, with councils looking to be rewarded for being worse off. It’s a system in need of reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government’s proposals will shift more financial power from Whitehall to the town hall, allowing councils far greater influence over the money they earn. Overall, councils will now get to keep 50% of business rate growth giving them a real incentive to go for growth and encourage enterprise and job creation. It has been estimated that these reforms could boost economic growth by around £10 billion over the next 7 years. If economic activity increases, the total amount of money raised from business rates will grow too. This means there will be more money ‘in the pot’ both for prosperous councils and to support less well-off areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will also have much greater flexibility to pool their business rates to encourage growth across their areas. The scheme also enables councils to borrow money against future business rate growth to fund infrastructure projects in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, councils that struggle to increase their business will have protection for basic services. And all councils will now have much greater certainty about their budgets over a longer period of time - allowing them to plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-will-the-new-scheme-work-in-practice"&gt;How will the new scheme work in practice?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of business rates going straight into the Treasury coffers, town halls will now get to keep a proportion of their growth in business rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that some wealthier local authorities earn more in business rates than they used to receive from the current formula grant and there are other local authorities who earn much less. So government is levelling the playing field through a mixture of ‘top-ups’ and ‘tariffs’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first instance, government will calculate a funding level for every local authority for 2013 to 2014. Should a local authority receive more in business rates than its funding level then government will pocket the difference (the ‘tariff’). This will be used entirely to ‘top up’ local authorities who receive less than their funding level. Government intends that this will be fixed for 7 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once underway the scheme allows local authorities to keep 50% of business rates income including growth. But without adjustment the scheme would be weighted towards richer local authorities. This is because, for a comparatively small investment in growth, local authorities with a large amount of business property can gain large increases in their revenue. In comparison, local authorities with a small amount of business property who put a lot in, may get comparatively little out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in a local authority with business rates income of £100 million and funding level of £50 million, a 5% increase in business rates income produces a 10% increase in income compared to its funding level. A local authority with a different rate base (£10 million) and the same funding level (£50 million), would find the same 5% increase in rates income only produces a 1% increase in income compared to its funding level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the rewards of growth more proportionate for different local authorities, where local authorities have greater business rates income than their funding level, the government will take some of their business rates growth as a levy. The levy will be calculated for each individual local authority and will be based on their original business rates income and their funding level. It is designed so that a 1% increase in business rates income will provide no more than a 1% increase in funding, except where this would impose a levy rate of more than 50p in the pound. In these cases the levy will be set so the authority keeps at least 50p in each pound of growth in its business rate income. This means that, even after the government’s 50% central share, at least 25p in each extra pound of business rates generated locally, will be retained locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money government takes as a levy will still be ploughed back into local authorities. In this case it will be used as a shock absorber to protect other authorities that see their business rates income drop by more than 7.5%, for example, as a result of a big local business in their local area closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-do-these-proposals-mean-for-you"&gt;What do these proposals mean for you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local residents should see greater investment in local services as local authorities see their business rates income increasing. Equally, spending is protected even if it suffers a significant decrease in its business rates income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses will see no change in the way their business rate bills are calculated. But they will have more influence on local authorities’ decisions, including their budget as the local authorities’ income is directly linked to the success of businesses in its area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charities and voluntary groups which currently receive tax relief on their bills will see no change, as such relief will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities will have much greater incentive to grow businesses in their areas and much greater certainty about their future funding - allowing them to plan ahead, manage risk, budget for the long term and plan for worst case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers will find a more encouraging atmosphere with local authorities actively seeking to encourage appropriately-sited and well-planned non-residential development. This is especially true of new renewable energy projects that start paying business rates from year 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police authority will not be affected by fluctuations in business rates in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All fire and rescue authorities (that are not part of a local authority) will be funded through a 2% share of each district or borough council’s business rates income. They will receive a top-up to bring their funding up to their funding level.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Greater rewards for local growth under new scheme</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/17/introduction/enacted"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 2012&lt;/a&gt; creates a new model for funding local authorities from April 2013, linking their financial revenue to the decisions they take to support local firms and local jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local government will retain a 50% local share of business rates and then keep a 50% share of any growth they generate, subject to a levy, providing a strong incentive to go for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new system could deliver around an extra £10 billion to the wider economy by 2020, and generate more business rate income for councils to help pay off the deficit and support frontline services that protect vulnerable communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following consultation responses, the government has changed the approach to the levy to increase the rewards for growth. The maximum levy will now be 50p in the pound. This translates into very real benefits for authorities: after the central share and levy payments, at least 25p in each extra pound of business rates generated locally will be retained locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document also confirms the safety net for when councils experience unexpected drops in revenue will guarantee a real terms income from business rates of 92.5%. This means council income will never fall below 7.5% of its baseline funding level ensuring no area gets left behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document confirms that the government will implement the majority of the technical proposals for the operation of the scheme set out in the summer consultation, together with changes to a number of detailed aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today, after listening to councils, we are setting the central principles for how the new rate retention scheme will work next year. Ahead of the formal funding settlement next month this will give councils the certainty and security to begin planning their budgets for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The old flawed system of government handouts to local authorities encouraged a begging bowl mentality, with each council vying to be more deprived than its neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These reforms allow councils to stand tall, and rewards them for supporting local jobs and local firms. All councils, including the least prosperous, have the opportunity to gain from this system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation originally proposed a levy set at higher ratio. This would have meant that a district council with a business rates baseline of £100 million and a baseline funding level of £5 million would have been subject to a levy rate of 95p in the pound. So if the authority realised business rates growth of £2 million, £1 million of this would have been paid to the central share, £200,000 would have been paid to the county council, and £760,000 would have been paid in a levy, leaving the authority with £40,000 of growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s document confirms that levy rate will in fact be limited to 50p in the pound creating a much greater growth reward. This would leave that same authority with £400,000, ie 10 times more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the West Midlands regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the West Midlands Plan and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919194311/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationwmrss"&gt;previous environmental report&lt;/a&gt; on the revocation of the West Midlands regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the West Midlands Plan and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Passengers to benefit from Olympic boost to services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music lovers and sports fans travelling to gigs and games will benefit from more convenient train services under plans to make it easier for operators to offer more flexible timetables, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes, which are being introduced after a successful trial during the London 2012 Games, will mean that on special occasions train operators will be able to adjust a small portion of the timetable to better serve passengers without seeking permission from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Olympic Games were a massive success and proved our transport system was able to successfully carry record numbers of passengers. We helped train operators cope with the changing demand by giving them more flexibility to give passengers the services they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This has proved such an unqualified success that we have decided to permanently cut the red tape involved in adjusting small portions of the timetable. The changes give train companies the opportunity to ensure passengers are able to plan ahead to ensure they make it to their football matches and concerts and back home again on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (&lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is good news for passengers. Train companies have been seeking greater freedom to adapt their timetables to suit the needs of their customers and this move will be a big boost for people wanting to enjoy many special events across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes enable operators in England to adapt their timetables to cater for events in the calendar year when changes in passenger demand are expected to be significantly different – such as during sporting and cultural events or during school holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train operators will be allowed to adjust up to 30% of their timetabled services for special occasions, ensuring that more frequent passengers are still able to enjoy regular services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Transport Secretary will retain discretion over all timetable changes and the new measures and passenger benefits gained will be reviewed within the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The General Consent protocol, which enables train operators to adjust a small portion of their timetables for special events, was trialled with Southern Trains from the 17 April – 23 June 2012. This was then extended to all English train operators during the London 2012 Games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The decision follows the success of the pilots and following consultation with Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch and &lt;abbr title="Association of Train Operating Companies"&gt;ATOC&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Secretary of State is not responsible for the management of services within Scotland and Wales&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Business rates retention</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="business-rates-retention"&gt;Business rates retention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-rates-retention-policy-statement"&gt;policy statement&lt;/a&gt; that provides early confirmation of the government’s policy decisions in a number of key areas following this summer’s technical consultation on the new business rate retention scheme. This policy statement will support local authorities, ahead of the provisional local government finance settlement, in their preparations for smooth implementation of the business rates retention scheme from April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business rates retention scheme will enable local authorities to retain a large proportion of locally collected business rates to help fund the services they provide, thereby creating a direct link between business rates collected and local authority income, and reducing local authorities’ dependency on central government grants. The scheme will give all councils a strong incentive to go for growth and could add approximately £10 billion to the wider economy by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy statement confirms government’s intention to proceed with the implementation of a range of proposals that were set out in the technical consultation. It also sets out a number of changes to those proposals, in response to comments received to the consultation, including the government’s intention to maintain the 1:1 proportionate levy but with a limit of 50p in the pound. This will translate into very real benefits for authorities, allowing at least 25p in each extra pound of business rates generated locally to be retained locally. In addition, the policy statement sets out the government’s intention to fix the safety net at 7.5% - the most generous level within the range consulted upon. This guarantee will be maintained in real terms, since baseline funding levels will be uprated by &lt;abbr title="Retail Prices Index"&gt;RPI&lt;/abbr&gt; for the purpose of calculating eligibility for the safety net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, government considers that these policy decisions will result in a system that provides a strong growth incentive for authorities, while being underpinned by robust protections to help councils maintain effective services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have placed a copy of the policy statement in the library of the House. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-local-authorities-more-control-over-how-they-spend-public-money-in-their-area--2"&gt;policy statement and a revised plain English guide to business rate retention&lt;/a&gt; are also available on the GOV.UK website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="data-consultation"&gt;Data consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also today publishing the data consultation on the 2013-14 local government finance settlement. The consultation sets out the majority of data that may be used in calculating the provisional baseline funding levels and revenue support grant allocations from 2013-14. This release will enable local authorities to begin checking the indicator data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/1314/settle.htm"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the local government finance website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="local-council-tax-support"&gt;Local Council Tax support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the introduction of local Council Tax support schemes in April 2013, the government consulted on aspects of the funding arrangements to support authorities to offer Council Tax support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I will publish an update on these arrangements, including on the government’s approach to addressing budget pressures to ensure all authorities have a fair starting point. Final funding allocations will be included in the provisional local government finance settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be publishing the Council Tax base regulations and the government response to the consultation on providing certainty for the funding of local precepting authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the final versions of 2 key Council Tax support regulations (first published in July) have been made and are soon to be published and laid before Parliament - the prescribed requirements scheme and the default scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the regulations will be available on the GOV.UK website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Correction to the written answer to Parliamentary Question 97198</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regret to inform the House that there was an inaccuracy in the answer given by the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State to Parliamentary Question 97198 on 1 March (Official Report, Column 450W) about Driving: Licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identifies poor performing MOT testing stations through a transparent and proportionate disciplinary points system published in the MOT Testing Guide. &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; cessate individual testers called Authorised Examiners (AEs) from carrying out MOT tests, not the test stations. AEs cessated in the last three years are 111 in 2008-09, 90 in 2009-10, and 89 in 2010-11 all after appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; identifies poor performing MOT testing stations through a transparent and proportionate disciplinary points system published in the MOT Testing Guide. &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; can take action against Authorised Examiners (AEs) and Nominated Testers (NTs).  AEs are an individual, partnership or company approved to carry out MOT tests.  NTs carry out the actual tests.  In the last three years, the Agency struck off 111 AEs in 08/09, 90 in 09/10, and 89 in 10/11, all after appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driving examiner strike on 30 November: candidates urged to attend tests</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving examiners who are members of the Public and Commercial Services (&lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt;) union could take strike action on Friday 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;) Chief Executive Rosemary Thew said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all examiners are members of the &lt;abbr title="Public and Commercial Services"&gt;PCS&lt;/abbr&gt; union. Even if they are, we can’t be sure that they’ll support the strike. So we’re asking you to come for your test so it can go ahead if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the inconvenience this will cause. We’ll do everything we can to minimise disruption for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t have to contact &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to rebook if you can’t take your test because of the strike action. You should hear from the agency with a new date within 5 to 10 working days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="out-of-pocket-expenses"&gt;Out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can claim out-of-pocket expenses if your test is cancelled, but you must have turned up for your test to do this. You’ll have to rebook your own test and you won’t be able to claim expenses if you don’t turn up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/practical-driving-test-for-cars/cancelled-or-stopped-tests-and-bad-weather" title="Claiming out-of-pocket expenses"&gt;Find out how to claim out-of-pocket expenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="customer-service-centre"&gt;Customer service centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s customer service centre for practical driving tests might also be affected by strike action on Friday 30 November. You’ll still be able to &lt;a href="/browse/driving/learning-to-drive" title="Book, change or cancel practical driving tests"&gt;book, change or cancel practical driving tests&lt;/a&gt; online on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="theory-tests"&gt;Theory tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theory tests aren’t affected by the strike action and will be taking place as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
