    <title>The UK's G8 priorities</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The UK's G8 Presidency will be an economic G8 that deals with big issues in the global economy and prioritises trade, tax and transparency.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK takes over the one-year Presidency of the G8 today (1 January) and will hold the annual leaders’ summit in Northern Ireland on 17 and 18 June. As the chair of the G8, the UK has a unique opportunity to lead in shaping the outcomes of the summit and taking concrete action with other G8 countries to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges, including important economic and foreign policy issues of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has announced that he will focus the G8 in 2013 on 3 key areas: open economies, open governments and open societies to unleash the power of the private sector by advancing trade, ensuring tax compliance and promoting greater transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="trade"&gt;Trade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater stimulus for growth in the world economy than trade and no more important battle than the fight against protectionism. The G8 has collective responsibility to drive forward trade liberalisation. Among G8 countries work is already on going to prepare a free trade agreement between the EU and Canada and work will start next year to begin free trade negotiations between the EU and Japan and the EU and US. An EU-US free trade agreement would be particularly significant – the EU and US together make up nearly a third of all global trade and an ambitious deal between the two could provide an enormous boost to jobs and growth. The G8 leaders’ summit will be an opportunity to show the importance of this ongoing work and to agree how to accelerate progress across our common trade priorities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tax"&gt;Tax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK’s G8 Presidency will focus on strengthening international tax standards and working on greater international tax information exchange to tackle tax havens.  This will build on work that is already underway in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and maintain the momentum set by the G20. And we will work with developing countries to enable them to collect tax that is due to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="transparency"&gt;Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G8 has a long history of advancing the development agenda - and the UK’s G8 Presidency will be no different. The UK is meeting its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on aid from 2013 and will hold other countries to account for their promises too. With this track record on aid, the Prime Minister plans to use the G8 Presidency to support the ‘golden thread’ of conditions that he sees as critical to the growth and prosperity of countries across the world. These include the absence of conflict, clamping down on corruption and ensuring strong and accountable government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency and accountability are vitally important to achieve these conditions. Too often, development at the G8 has been about rich countries doing things to poor countries. But at Lough Erne the G8 will focus on getting its own house in order and helping developing countries to prosper in the process. An example of this is mineral wealth. It’s important that developing countries rich in minerals see this as a blessing not a curse. The UK is already leading efforts in the EU that will require oil, gas and mining companies to publish key financial information for each country and project they work on. The UK’s G8 Presidency will push for greater transparency all around the globe so that revenues from oil, gas and mining are transparent. This should encourage greater accountability and ensure money doesn’t fuel conflict and corruption, but instead is used to provide better public services for citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined action on trade, tax and transparency during the UK’s G8 Presidency could lay the foundations of long-term growth and prosperity for generations to come and will support the development of open economies, open governments and open societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s G8 Presidency will also make progress across a range of vital global issues, including foreign policy challenges and supporting Arab Spring countries. The UK’s Presidency will also build on the Olympic Hunger Summit and the US’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, leading the way in the battle against hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this year the UK will also produce a comprehensive accountability report (CAR) that will show progress against key commitments made by the G8. The report is a concrete example of transparency and accountability at work, a central theme of the UK’s G8 Presidency, and an opportunity to hold G8 leaders to account. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lough Erne: G8 venue</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Prime Minister has chosen to hold this year's G8 Summit at Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 the UK will hold the Presidency of the G8. As part of the year-long Presidency there will be a G8 Summit of the 8 global leaders in June. The Prime Minister has chosen to hold this year’s G8 Summit at Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, in Northern Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing the G8 to Lough Erne will showcase to the world a modern Northern Ireland with huge potential for investment and tourism, demonstrating the growing confidence that exists in this part of the UK. It will highlight what Northern Ireland, its people and its businesses have to offer the global community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue of Lough Erne 2013 was also chosen because it creates the right conditions to encourage open and frank discussions between the G8 leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to welcoming my fellow leaders to Lough Erne and to showcase Northern Ireland to the world as a modern and dynamic part of the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Northern Ireland’s transformation over the last 2 decades was made possible by the courage of so many people across sections of the community. Their determination and leadership has inspired the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the G8?</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The G8 is a forum that brings together 8 global leaders to address global issues and tackle the most pressing global challenges.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The G8 (Group of 8) is made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the USA and the UK. The EU is represented by Jose Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, and Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council. The Presidency of the G8 rotates each calendar year and the country holding the G8 Presidency is responsible for hosting and organising the annual summit, with a number of preparatory meetings leading up to it. The summit is an opportunity for G8 leaders to have frank and open discussions about the important global issues of the day. In 2013 it will be the UK’s turn to shape the G8’s approach to these discussions with G8 leaders holding each other to account and agreeing concrete steps to advance growth and prosperity across the world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="history-of-the-g8"&gt;History of the G8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973 the world experienced its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The finance ministers of the USA, UK, France and West Germany met informally to talk about how they could solve the economic problems linked with the oil price shock. In 1974 Japan was invited to the meetings and in 1975 the French President brought these informal discussions to the leaders. He also invited Italy to what was the first G6 in Rambouillet, France. There was no army of political advisers in tow, just the leaders in a relaxed and private setting. This low-key formula was very successful and the leaders agreed to meet annually. A year later Canada joined and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia became a full member in 1998. The EU has been part of the group since 1977, but does not hold a Presidency. Almost 40 years on, the G8 countries can provide guidance and stability in an unpredictable world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-presidency-involve"&gt;What does the Presidency involve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G8 Presidency runs for 1 calendar year and rotates among the 8 member countries. The country chairing the Presidency is responsible for shaping the issues that leaders discuss at the G8 Summit and hosts a number of preparatory meetings leading up to the summit. It also acts as the spokesperson for the G8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Presidency is an opportunity for the UK to influence the international debate on our global priorities, which include tax, trade and transparency. At the end of this year, the UK will hand over the Presidency to Russia for 2014. The Presidency will continue in its rotation to Germany in 2015, Japan in 2016, Italy in 2017, Canada in 2018, France in 2019, and the USA in 2020 before it returns to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-g8-do"&gt;What does the G8 do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G8 is a forum that provides the opportunity for its members to co-operate in addressing global challenges. The standards it sets, commitments it makes and steps it takes aim to drive prosperity and economic growth all over the world. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that this year the G8 will return to its roots, creating the right environment for frank and open discussions to promote growth and address global economic problems. There will be a short declaration aimed at holding G8 leaders to account and ensuring that good intentions become vital actions to advance growth and prosperity across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 10 and 11 April 2013, the Foreign Secretary William Hague will host his counterparts from the G8 countries. They will meet for the G8 foreign ministers’ meeting at Lancaster House in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On announcing the meeting, the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to the UK’s G8 Presidency making headway on the serious challenges facing our global community today. Today the Prime Minister explained that by supporting the development of open economies, open governments and open societies we can harness the power of the private sector for everyone’s benefit. Our G8 priorities of advancing trade, ensuring tax compliance and promoting greater transparency can only take place in an environment of political stability and peaceful international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With my G8 foreign minister partners, I look forward to discussing and taking decisions on some of the most pressing foreign and security policy issues that we face. In particular I will be focusing on the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, a personal priority for me during the UK’s G8 Presidency and beyond, and ensuring that the G8’s Deauville Partnership provides the support needed by our partners in the Arab world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g7-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-meeting"&gt;G7 finance ministers’ and Central Bank governors’ meeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 10 to 11 May 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and the Governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King will host a spring meeting of the G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On announcing the meeting, the Chancellor said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to hosting colleagues from the G7 to Britain in the spring. This group remains an important institution and a key forum in which to grapple with the challenges that face the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This meeting will be a significant opportunity for the UK and our partners to take on these challenges and to show leadership in the fight to tackle the ongoing ramifications of the global financial and debt crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Action on council tax a helping hand to residents cost of living, says Eric Pickles</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Communities Secretary hailed new rules for 2013 that mean taxpayers can now choose to pay their bill over 12 months rather than 10.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move will lower average band D council tax instalments by an average of £24 per month for 10 months and helps tax payers manage their finances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation passed by the government means that in 2013 council tax payers can now request to pay their bills over a longer period of time, lowering their monthly bills, and so easing the financial burden&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has already &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/third-year-of-council-tax-freeze-announced"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; support for local authorities in England to help them freeze council tax in 2014-15 for a third year and assist in keeping bills down. The government has set aside £450 million as part of the Autumn Statement package to help support local authorities. Taxpayers living in an average band D home in England could save up to £72 compared to a 5% increase, while the cumulative effect of the 3 freezes is potentially worth over £200 to band D residents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils will also be able to publish online the detailed supporting information that until now they have had to supply with council tax bills in hard copies. While residents still have the legal right to request hard-copy documents, the online versions will enable authorities to cut costs, improve efficiencies and help the environment through a decrease in the use of paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are also urging councils to follow the example of utility companies in offering discounts to those customers who pay online or through direct debit facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know many people are worried about their cost of living expenses and we’ve already acted to freeze council tax in the past 2 years after bills doubled under the last administration. We have now offered councils a third freeze deal, which could have a combined effect potentially worth over £200 to band D residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have also changed the rules so hard working council residents can choose to pay their annual bills online or spread their payments over 12 months instead of 10. These sensible measures will make paying easier giving tax payers a little more room for manoeuvre and bring down their monthly outgoings by around £24 for most of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billing authorities collect and enforce council tax as per the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/613/contents/made"&gt;Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/3038/contents/made"&gt;Council Tax (Demand Notices)(England) Regulations 2011&lt;/a&gt;. For each financial year, billing authorities must issue demand notices (the bill) setting out the amount that is due and how it is to be paid. From April 2013, the demand notice will inform bill payers of their right to pay in 12 instalments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government consulted on its technical reforms to council tax between 31 October and 29 December 2011. The government’s response can be found on the 
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/technical-reforms-of-council-tax"&gt;consultation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has set aside £450 million over two years as part of the Autumn Statement package to help support local authorities in freezing their council tax in 2013-14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Simmonds MP, the UK Minister for Africa, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome today’s agreement by the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee to add the Congolese rebel group, M23, to its list of sanctioned organisations and individuals. The Committee also agreed the listings of two M23 leaders, Eric Badege and Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, as well as of the militia group Forces Democratiques de Libération du Rwanda (FDLR). The UK supports these measures as part of the international community’s response to the crisis in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We remain committed to finding long term solutions which will end the cycle of violence in the DRC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The dialogue needed to resolve the crisis must ensure that all violence stops, that external support to M23 ends and that there is no impunity for M23 commanders and others who have committed serious human rights abuses, including the FDLR. It is also important that the DRC Government shows leadership in addressing the underlying causes of conflict in the East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK, with its partners, will continue to seek ways to support the building of a sustainable peace in eastern DRC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Office for Life Sciences</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>The Office for Life Sciences is part of BIS - it ensures a competitive UK life sciences industry and secures investment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="strategy-for-uk-life-sciences---one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has launched &lt;a href="/government/publications/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for life sciences - One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, a report which summarises progress made in the first 12 months since last year’s launch of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-1429-strategy-for-uk-life-sciences.pdf"&gt;‘Strategy for UK life sciences’&lt;/a&gt;. Health Life Sciences is one of the 11 sectors that have been prioritised as part of the government’s industrial strategy. &lt;a href="/government/speeches/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;See David Willetts’ speech relating to the report.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategy for UK life sciences is based on three pillars: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a UK life sciences ecosystem: the government is making it easier for researchers to commercialise academic research, placing clinical research at the heart of the NHS, and empowering patients to participate in research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attracting, developing and rewarding talent: the government is introducing measures to attract and nurture world-leading talent and develop scientific excellence (these measures are ensuring that the UK offers exciting and rewarding careers for clinicians, scientists and technicians from all around the world)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcoming barriers and creating incentives for the promotion of healthcare innovation: the government is introducing measures to incentivise early-stage investment and nurture the best innovations through the translational funding gap to a point at which they can secure follow-on investment - we’ll continue to reduce the bureaucracy of setting up clinical trials to ensure that patients have access to promising, cost-effective, new treatments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Year On reports the substantial progress made this year in implementing these measures. In order to strengthen networks between academia, industry and the NHS, the government is investing £1 billion a year through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS. The £180 million Biomedical Catalyst was introduced to bridge the ‘valley of death’ between the bench and the clinic, and the early response from industry is that this funding is already having the intended impact of stimulating innovative research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the progress made to date, One Year On announces the government’s commitment to the sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients over the next three to five years. This work will initially focus on cancer patients, patients with rare diseases and infectious disease. We are working across government to ensure that research, academia and industry are key players in promoting the adoption of genomic technology to provide better healthcare and help the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy for UK life sciences was launched alongside, and is being implemented in collaboration with, the NHS chief executive’s review: [Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating adoption and diffusion in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;. The update to this report, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/12/ihw-creating-change/"&gt;Creating Change: Innovation, Health and Wealth One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, was published on 10 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also published on 10 December 2012 was the latest report on the bioscience and health technology database, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/12-p90-strength-and-opportunity-2012-medical-technology-sectors.pdf"&gt;Strength and opportunity 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/sectoropportunities/lifesciences.html"&gt;The New UK Life Science Prospectus Life sciences in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has one of the strongest and most productive life sciences industries in the world, contributing to patient well-being as well as supporting growth. UK life science industries generate turnover of over £50bn and employ 167,500 people in over 4,500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry is high-tech, innovative and highly diverse, spanning pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, and industrial biotechnology and has applications across many other sectors. Through the development of innovative medicines, medical technologies and services, its businesses contribute to a stronger and fairer society, helping people enjoy better health, well-being and quality of life. They are also helping the UK improve its sustainability and increase rates of decarbonisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is building on and fostering these strengths and responding to the changing global commercial environment. We want to make the UK the location of choice for pioneering life sciences research and development (&lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt;) and manufacturing investment, so that life sciences will continue to be vibrant in the UK and a key contributor to sustained economic growth and health improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office for Life Sciences (&lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;) works closely with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, championing biotechnology and the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. We also work with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk"&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk"&gt;Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)&lt;/a&gt; and other departments, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (&lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; and the life sciences industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="views-on-the-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research"&gt;Views on the use of animals in scientific research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ipsos MORI report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/ipsos-mori-views-on-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research-september-2012.pdf"&gt;‘Views on the use of animals in scientific research’&lt;/a&gt; presents the findings of a 2012 survey on awareness of, and public attitudes towards, the use of animals in scientific research. This survey has been carried out since 1999 on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that 85% of the representative sample conditionally accept the use of animals in scientific research. While this year’s findings show a decline in overall public acceptance, it also identifies that a significant proportion of the representative sample (40%) would like to know more information about the use of animals in scientific research before forming a firm opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has challenged the scientific community to respond to these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="areas-of-work-for-the-ols"&gt;Areas of work for the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt; is focused on 2 areas: healthcare and the bio-economy. The healthcare team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical technology – devices and diagnostics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bio-economy team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agricultural biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These teams work across a range of policy areas supporting business growth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHS market access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finance and tax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bio-economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="nhs-market-access"&gt;NHS market access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Te market access team works closely with the other &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; teams, the Department of Health, and other departments and agencies. The NHS is a major contributor to economic growth, and we work together to maximise this contribution and to address any barriers to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main areas of interest for the market access team are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reforms to the NHS, including the introduction of value-based pricing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the NHS procurement strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engaging with &lt;abbr title="Department of Health"&gt;DH&lt;/abbr&gt;’s delivery of [‘Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating uptake and diffusion of innovation in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299"&gt;NHS’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we are considering how these will create opportunities for the business environment and support the growth agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="innovation"&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our focus is to ensure that industry has the right environment to innovate and in particular to remove barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently focusing on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="regenerative-medicine"&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the impact of the £25 million &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukrmp.org.uk/"&gt;UK Regenerative Medicine Platform&lt;/a&gt; which addresses the technical and scientific challenges associated with translating promising scientific discoveries in this area towards clinical impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contributing to the House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into Regenerative Medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="medicines-licensing"&gt;Medicines licensing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the government’s commitment to consult on an Early Access Scheme for Medicines &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exploring more progressive approaches to medicines regulations, including adaptive licensing, through the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; Expert Group on Healthcare Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="clinical-trials-environment"&gt;Clinical trials environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the European Commission’s plans to replace the European Clinical Trials Directive with a Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="open-innovation"&gt;Open innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the changing &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; landscape and a growing interest in new ways of partnership working, we organised a seminar on Open Innovation in May 2012. Relevant public sector organisations including the Intellectual Property Office, Technology Strategy Board, Clinical Practice Research Datalink as well as private sector interest (AstraZeneca (PPT, 2.6 Mb), Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson discussed the opportunities of the approach to the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-projects"&gt;Infrastructure projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is co-funding 2 key investment projects to stimulate further growth and address market failures by providing incubation facilities for new companies. These bioincubators are based in Stevenage in Hertfordshire, alongside the GlaxoSmithKline &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; headquarters, and on the Edinburgh BioQuarter site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has also co-funded the Industrial Biotechnology 10,000 litre Demonstrator in Wilton, an open access facility to enable companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, to trial different biomass feedstock and processes to manufacture biobased products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stevenage-bioscience-catalyst"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.stevenagecatalyst.com/"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; will be the first purpose-built, open innovation campus for drug discovery and development. It will maximise the economic impact of academic and science expertise and foster a successful open innovation model between big pharmaceutical and small bioscience companies. It will act as a catalyst to position the UK at the forefront of scientific innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst will be located alongside the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; Headquarters in Stevenage and is being developed in stages. Phase 1 comprises the construction of BioIncubator and Accelerator buildings for early-stage bioscience companies. Phase 1 is being funded by &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;, the East of England Development Agency (EEDA), the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), GSK and the Wellcome Trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future phases will bring the catalyst up to 45,000 square metres by 2016, assuming that the market demand is as expected. This is forecast to create 1500 new jobs and stimulate the creation of up to 5 new businesses. All future phases will be commercially funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="edinburgh-bioquarter---bioincubator"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter - BioIncubator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.edinburghbioquarter.com/"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter&lt;/a&gt; is a landmark life sciences hub that is establishing Edinburgh and Scotland as one of the world’s top 10 centres for biomedical research and commercialisation. The project is a long-term life science property and commercialisation partnership between Scottish Enterprise, the University of Edinburgh, the NHS and US-based private sector partner, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. The 100-acre site already houses the University of Edinburgh Queen’s Medical Research Institute and the 870-bed Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh teaching hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and Scottish Enterprise are co-funding the creation of the BioIncubator. This investment is expected to leverage almost £210m of additional investment and create or retain over 700 high-value jobs. This will enhance the global reputation of the UK as a place for leading life science innovation, by creating an infrastructure for supporting industry to collaborate with academic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Edinburgh is aiming to produce 18 new life sciences companies over the next 5 years which will add a considerable pipeline of demand for the BioIncubator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="industrial-biotechnology-demonstrator"&gt;Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in Wilton in the Tees Valley, the new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk-cpi.com/industrial-biotechnology/demonstrator"&gt;National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/a&gt; is an open access facility of a unique scale of 10,000-litre working volume capacity. The demonstrator has 2 main applications: it can be used as a proof of concept facility to scale-up the production of materials to near commercial levels; and as a product manufacturing facility for clients experiencing temporary capacity restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator"&gt;NIBF&lt;/abbr&gt; will allow biotechnology companies to de-risk product and process development. By exploring and then optimising processes, companies will be are able to calculate the most cost-effective combination of materials; process steps and sequences; and the equipment needed to manufacture profitably. Consequently, they will minimise the risk of investing in the wrong capital equipment, using inefficient processes or facing unexpected costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Innovation standardisation</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>Effective standardisation encourages innovation and forceful competition and improves profitability.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="standardisation"&gt;Standardisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation helps innovation to be applied to the whole economy and makes sure that most companies are not too far behind the early adopters of new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation can help business by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing better access to markets &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering measurable benefits when used within the infrastructure of a company itself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minimising business costs and risks &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;streamlining internal processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improving communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By promoting interoperability, standardisation provides a competitive edge in the market place; necessary for worldwide trading of products and services. In particular for SMEs, demonstrable compliance with an accepted standard can replace the power of a big brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-standardisation"&gt;What is standardisation?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation includes the development of the standard as well as how it is used. End-users should have confidence in their purchase because the supplier has used an appropriate standard and has gone through independent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="biss-role-in-standardisation"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;’s role in standardisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is responsible for UK government policy on everything to do with standards-making, accreditation and conformity assessment. We will strengthen the standards, accreditation and conformity assessment infrastructure so that it meets the needs of UK industry and to make the processes more relevant and business friendly. We sponsor, and work closely with, the British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the UK National Standards Body (&lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the National Accreditation Body (&lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the European Commission (EC) we help develop European standardisation policy, which can remove barriers to trade. This includes the recent EC regulation on accreditation and market surveillance, and the EC decision on a common framework for marketing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also the central contact point for Directive 98/34/EC that requires member states to notify the EC of proposed national technical regulations; and Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment; and Refusals of Mutual Recognition Decision 3052/95/EC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work closely with technical regulations colleagues and also a number of other government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD’s &lt;abbr title="(UK Defence Standardization"&gt;DStan&lt;/abbr&gt; (UK Defence Standardization) works to develop, facilitate and communicate UK MOD standardisation policies, standards, procedures and guidance on standardisation both nationally and internationally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="standardisation-infrastructure"&gt;Standardisation infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conformity assessment helps companies demonstrate that they have met customers’ needs and includes activities like testing, inspection and certification. The organisations that test, inspect, etc, are known as Conformity Assessment Bodies (&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt;). &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; works to make sure conformity assessment in the UK is well managed, competent and market driven, and so contributes to the productivity and competitiveness of UK businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; notified to the Commission under the European New Approach legislation are known as Notified Bodies (&lt;abbr title="Notified bodies"&gt;NBs&lt;/abbr&gt;). Where there is European Community legislation, the requirements for &lt;abbr title="Notified bodies"&gt;NBs&lt;/abbr&gt; makes sure that products and services assessed in one member state can be accepted in another. However, where there are national regulatory requirements, conformity assessment requirements can differ from country to country and can create barriers to trade. Our work on the quality and conformity assessment infrastructure helps to reduce these barriers by providing ways that allow recognition of conformity assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has produced a guidance document for regulators, on the conformity assessment aspects of European Decision 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products. It deals with the requirements for notification of &lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; and conformity assessment procedures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="accreditation"&gt;Accreditation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accreditation is given when a conformity assessment body is recognised as competent to carry out specific tasks. It is generally accepted that for an accreditation body to be authoritative it must have the support of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A statement of the main principles relating to conformity assessment policy in the UK, including accreditation, has been developed and was first published in May 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="standards"&gt;Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards are the the most important point of the infrastructure, providing the matrix in which the other elements operate with &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;, playing an important role in developing standards domestically and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a toy maker the chances are you will wish to manufacture your toy so that it meets the relevant international and national standards - this will help you sell your product in the UK as well as overseas. To demonstrate to buyers that your product really does meet the standard you will need to employ an independent and impartial third party to assess your product against the standard. These third parties are known as conformity assessment bodies (&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t want to use any old organisation, but a CAB who you know to be competent and whose assessment will be universally accepted. National Accreditation Bodies (NABS) - &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is the UK’s &lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt; - assess the &lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; against international standards to make sure that they are competent to assess against specific standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NABs are reviewed to make sure that they are competent by taking evaluations by their peers and by being subject to government audit and appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This infrastructure provides confidence, trust and assurance to consumers and purchasers that the toy meets the standard that the manufacturer claims it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="non-accredited-certification"&gt;Non-accredited certification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is aware that some certification bodies and certification body representative associations are concerned at the increase in the number of UK organisations offering non-accredited certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, have a look at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/c/12-759-conformity-assessment-and-accreditation-policy.pdf"&gt;Conformity Assessment Accreditation Policy&lt;/a&gt;  on Accreditation and Conformity Assessment, and specifically to section 3.4 on the application of the accreditation principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In applying these principles, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommends Conformity Assessment Bodies to be accredited by the National Accreditation Body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recommends UK businesses, government and local authorities requiring third party conformity assessment services to source such services, where they exist, from conformity assessment bodies accredited by a National Accreditation Body.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has further advised certification representative organisations in the UK that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only get ‘accreditation’ (in the UK) from United Kingdom Accreditation Service through the regulation. Any organisation that is suggesting it is accredited in the sense of the regulation when they are not, is likely to be guilty of an offence under the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008 (Statutory Instrument 2008/1276).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certification bodies or representative organisations should refer these cases to trading standards or the Office of Fair Trading in the first instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance"&gt;EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and market surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation will, for the first time, establish a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 4(1) of Regulation 765/08 required that &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; appoint a single National Accreditation Body (&lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;) for the United Kingdom. The Accreditation Regulations 2009 (Statutory Instrument 2009 No. 3155), laid in Parliament on 3 December 2009, appointed the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the UK’s &lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/contents/made"&gt;statutory instrument&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/memorandum/contents"&gt;explanatory memorandum&lt;/a&gt; are available from the legislation.gov.uk website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In support of this statutory instrument, &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; signed, on 8 December 2009, a revised memorandum of understanding with &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementation-of-eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance-in-the-united-kingdom"&gt;Implementation of EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and Market Surveillance in the United Kingdom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation established a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drafts of both the statutory instrument and &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt; were tabled at the &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; Policy Advisory Committee on 1 October 2009 as well as being circulated to the &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; conformity assessment consultation group (ConCAss). While the main interest in these documents is contained within these 2 groups, they were open for comment to the public in general, and a copy is available below. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;’s response to the comments received was made on 25 November 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="british-standards-institution-bsi"&gt;British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work in this area covers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the government’s general policy on matters relating to standards-making (but not on the individual standards)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the government’s relations with the British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) and its funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s standards development work, including support for delegations representing the UK at overseas standards meetings and for consumer representation in standards-making activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer representation is vital in influencing the standards to reflect the needs and expectations of the general public for things like safety and security, labelling, accessibility, fairness and redress.  More can be found about consumer representation and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services"&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Consumer and Public Interest Network on the &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; itself is an independent body, established by Royal Charter in the 1920s, although its origins go back to 1901. Its HQ is at Chiswick. More information can be found on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s own website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills recognise that, whilst the process of developing standards facilitated by &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; in the UK is a voluntary activity, there is a public interest in standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A revised memorandum of understanding (&lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;) between &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the department was signed on 20 June 2002. The main changes from the previous &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt; included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incorporation of main points from the joint statement of the public interest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recognition that &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; has significant commercial businesses outside its &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; functions, and focuses on the relationship between the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; and non-&lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; sides - this has meant defining a ‘ring-fence’ both in terms of the use of public funds and in the precedence of the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; as a whole&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an indication of a willingness in principle to provide government support if the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; runs into major difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening of the international and European context, including a specific reference to standardisation policy developed by the Council of the EU&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear encouragement to &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; to develop their standardisation business beyond traditional ‘full’ standards in response to new technology, globalisation, etc, coupling this with a specific obligation to avoid ‘new products’ spreading at the expense of full standards in circumstances where the new features of full standards are still required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Memorandum of Understanding (&lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;), provides a framework for &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the government to meet the challenges to the UK’s standards-making infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h3 id="funding"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; standards work is provided in 2 main ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as direct financial support to &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; (which is linked to specific deliverables)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as help to those involved in the standards preparation work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="schemes"&gt;Schemes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Assisted International Travel Scheme provides a contribution towards the travel costs of the leaders of committee delegations to overseas standards meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Consultancy Drafting Scheme allows the &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; technical committees to use an outside expert to help prepare the first draft of a standard that is needed quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the consumer travel expenses fund contributes to the travel costs of consumer representatives in national and overseas committees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a condition on approval of funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and standards-making activities in 2000-2001, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry requested that a study be carried out of the economic benefits of standardisation, in particular of the government’s financial support for standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Swann of Manchester Business School, conducted this study, beginning with a review of the literature in this particular field. The report of his study is available below in English, French and German, along with an update from May 2010 exploring developments and progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="united-kingdom-accreditation-service-ukas"&gt;United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is recognised as the sole UK organisation for the accreditation of certification, testing and inspection bodies to the EN 45000 and ISO 17000 series of standards. These bodies - the Conformity Assessment Bodies - in turn certify, test and inspect companies’ systems and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is licensed by &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; to use and confer the national accreditation symbols (formerly national accreditation marks) which symbolise government recognition of the accreditation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; and accredited organisations is available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification bodies and companies registered by &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification bodies are listed in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tso-quality.co.uk/qaregister/subscriber/about.htm"&gt;United Kingdom Register of Quality Assessed Companies published by the Stationery Office.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of conformity assessment bodies. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification, testing and calibration and inspection reduces the need for suppliers to be assessed by each of their customers. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;’ involvement in international groups provides mutual recognition that reduces the need for multiple assessments of suppliers and as a helps to reduce barriers to trade. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; therefore recommends the use of &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; accredited conformity assessment services whenever this is an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; also assesses potential Notified Bodies on behalf of &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and other government departments according to the principles established by &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="recent-ec-legislation"&gt;Recent EC legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance [EC 765 of 2008]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EC Decision on a common framework for the marketing of products [EC 768 of 2008]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;have received approval, following a review of the new approach. These are complementary and both aim to improve the free movement of goods within the internal market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulation puts accreditation into a legal framework in the EEA, enhancing confidence in conformity assessment by strengthening the role of accreditation. It will also reinforce market surveillance structures to protect citizens from unsafe products (including those from outside the EU) and helps compliant businesses by removing those products from the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision, which will not have direct effect in member states, will set a formal framework for future European legislative proposals that fall within its scope. The scope is very broad for both proposals and includes all products subject to community harmonisation legislation (with notable exceptions such as food and medicines). The decision contains additional measures that will be integrated into the legal framework as specific legislative proposals are brought forward. This will clarify commonly used procedures and terms (which are often used differently) so that all stakeholders can be clear on relative responsibilities. In addition there are new rules to enhance confidence in CE marking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="eu-notification-requirements-goods-and-electronic-services"&gt;EU notification requirements: goods and electronic services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="directive-9834ec"&gt;Directive 98/34/EC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Notification requirements for goods and electronic services is known as the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 98/34/EC (as amended by Directive 98/48/EC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive applies to ‘information society services’ (ie services supplied at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services), and to all industrially manufactured products and agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive aims to prevent new technical barriers to trade being created and has a procedure for providing information on technical standards and regulation. It applies to all member states, the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), EFTA (Switzerland) and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="technical-regulations"&gt;Technical regulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulations that need notification have to be notified to the commission in draft, and generally observe a 3-month ‘standstill’ period before the regulation is made or brought into force. This is so that the  commission and member states can raise concerns about potential barriers to trade. If a notified regulation is considered as a barrier to trade, a detailed opinion may be submitted and this will extend the standstill period for a another 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; acts as the central unit for the UK, administering the notification procedure on behalf of government departments and receiving other member states’ notifications for onward transmission to the relevant department. Government departments involve industry as appropriate in their comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="directive-9834---a-guide"&gt;Directive 98/34 - a guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directive 98/34 sets up a legal mechanism, which requests member states to notify the commission and the other members of their technical regulations, at a draft stage, where amendments can still be introduced and a standstill period of 3 months observed before the draft technical regulation (except for urgencies, fiscal and financial measures) is adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="case-study-non-notification-of-technical-regulations-under-directive-9834ec--video-recordings-act-1984"&gt;Case study: non-notification of technical regulations under directive 98/34/ec – video recordings act 1984&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2009 there was a great deal of negative press coverage when it was discovered that the provisions of the Video Recordings Act 1984 were unenforceable as a result of the UK’s failure to notify the measure under Directive 98/34/EC. It was made clear that, because of the unenforceability of the regulations, legislation that would protect under 18s from unsuitable videos - potentially containing violent or sexually-explicit material - was never enacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although non-notification of technical regulations falling within the scope of Directive 98/34/EC is not a major issue in the UK, the consequences of any failure to notify can be serious and steps have been taken to make sure that this situation does not arise again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the non-enforceability of the Video Recordings Act was discovered, the relevant legislation was notified to the European Commission in September 2009 (notification 2009/0495/UK - The Video Recordings Act 1984 (as adopted by the Video Recordings Bill) and The Video Recordings (Labelling) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;amp;iNumber=0495&amp;amp;"&gt;Regulations to be made under section 8 of the adopted 1984 Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed in December 2009 by the related notification 2009/0664/UK - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;amp;iNumber=0664&amp;amp;"&gt;The Digital Economy Bill (extract of five clauses and a Schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2009 a joint Cabinet Office/&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; letter was sent to Permanent Secretaries reminding government departments of the need to comply with the provisions of Directive 98/34/EC. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; followed this up in early 2010 with a letter to Directive 98/34/EC policy leads, drawing attention to a request in the Cabinet Office/&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; communication of October 2009 for all government departments to carry out an assessment of all technical regulations they had made since 1983 for compatibility with the directive, in order to ensure that all relevant legislation had been correctly notified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Cabinet Office and &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; letters of late 2009 and early 2010, government departments carried out their assessments as requested. Although we received confirmations that regulations compatible with Directive 98/34/EC had been notified, further instances of non-notification came to light. The following are examples of notifications submitted as a result of assessments revealing failure to comply with the directive as required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;amp;iNumber=0318&amp;amp;sCountry=UK&amp;amp;"&gt;2010/0318/UK - PAS66:2009 Official identification eartags for sheep and goats – Specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;amp;iNumber=0319&amp;amp;sCountry=UK&amp;amp;"&gt;2010/0319/UK - 2010/0319/UK - PAS44:2009 Official identification for cattle – Specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson learned from the above is that it is very important for all government departments to constantly check any proposed new legislation for notifiability under Directive 98/34/EC, and notify any compatible regulations in draft before making them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notifications-and-comments"&gt;Notifications and comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-the-notification-system-works"&gt;How the notification system works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is based on member states consulting each other and the commission before they adopt technical regulations and to modify their drafts if necessary. The directive requires member states to communicate to the commission any draft technical regulation which they plan to adopt using the notification form available on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each member state has a central contact point for the directive which coordinates notifications of new national technical regulations as well as those received from other member states, as well as responses to the notifications. The UK contact point is in the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and can be contacted by email: 9834@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new technical regulation is notified, the notification form (in pdf) is completed by the department proposing the measure, specifying the content and reasons for its enactment. The completed form is then sent to the central contact point for processing and forwarding to the commission, together with the draft text of the regulation to be notified, impact assessment if one is available and other relevant documentation that would help the commission and other member states in assessing the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission then sends all the information communicated by the notifying member state to all the other member states and allocates a 3-month standstill period. The date of receipt by the commission of the draft national technical regulation communicated by a member state and of all the requested documents is the beginning of the 3-month standstill period during which the member state concerned is strictly obliged not to adopt the draft notified regulation. During this standstill period, the commission or member states can respond with comments or a detailed opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When notifications from other member states are received, the central contact point forwards them to the lead department and other departments with an interest, providing an opportunity to submit comments or detailed opinions if they feel this is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="when-to-send-comments"&gt;When to send comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are sent when the notified text, although in accordance with community law, raises issues of interpretation or calls for details of the arrangements for its implementation. They can also give an overall assessment of the measure, having regard to the general principles of community law and policies implemented in this context, or inform the member state of its future obligations with regard to acts to be adopted on a community level. Comments do not extend the initial 3-month standstill period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responding-to-comments"&gt;Responding to comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the directive, the notifying member state has no formal obligation to reply to the comments received. In practice, however, member states frequently do so on a voluntary basis and generally take account of comments they receive. All responses to comments should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="detailed-opinions"&gt;“Detailed opinions”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed opinions are sent by the commission or the member states when they consider that the draft measure envisaged would, if adopted, create obstacles to the free movement of goods, the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment of service operators within the internal market. These detailed opinions seek to obtain an amendment to the proposed measure, in order to remove at source any resulting barriers to such freedoms. A detailed opinion received on a notification extends the initial 3-month standstill period by another 3 months, ie to a total of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responding-to-a-detailed-opinion"&gt;Responding to a detailed opinion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Member states must reply to a detailed opinion addressed to them by the commission or another member state. Although the directive does not specify the time allowed for reply, it is nevertheless desirable that a response be made as soon as possible in the interests of efficiency, preferably during the standstill periods of 6 or 4 months, respectively for goods and information society services. All responses to detailed opinions should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="confirmation-that-a-member-state-is-free-to-make-a-regulation-once-the-standstill-period-has-ended"&gt;Confirmation that a member state is free to make a regulation once the standstill period has ended&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation is received from the commission. Once a standstill period for any particular notification has ended, the originator is free to make the regulation provided that no comments or opinions have been received and/or there are no issues still outstanding as result of a detailed opinion. It is a good idea to check with the central point just after the standstill period has ended, in case any last minute comments or opinions have been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="national-regulations-and-notification"&gt;National regulations and notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only those technical regulations that come within the scope of the directive require notification and there are certain exceptions allowed in the directive. The directive defines what is a ‘technical regulation’ and it is very wide in scope, for example it includes codes of practice and voluntary agreements so government departments have to check whether the regulations they wish to enact come within the scope of notification. If they do, the department should notify the regulations at a draft stage and observe the standstill period before adopting the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-if-a-regulation-is-not-notified"&gt;What if a regulation is not notified?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission can initiate infraction proceedings for failure to notify a national regulation that comes within the scope of the directive. If in doubt measures should be notified in draft since a non-notified measure which should have been notified will be unenforceable. It is not possible to make a notification if a regulation is already in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central contact point in &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; will be happy to give you further information or answer your queries. In addition to the information that is already available on our website, you may also find the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/index_en.htm"&gt;Commission’s website on Directive 98/34/EC&lt;/a&gt; helpful from where you can download reference documents for example, the text of the Directive, Commission’s guidance document, their reports on the functioning of the Directive and case law as well as the ability to search their database of notifications already made by member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="submitting-a-notification"&gt;Submitting a notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For government departments or agencies wishing to know more about the directive and the notification system, guidance for officials is also available.

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
