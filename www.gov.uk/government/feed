    <summary>FCO Minister for Africa comments on vote agreeing sanctions against groups and individuals involved in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Simmonds MP, the UK Minister for Africa, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome today’s agreement by the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee to add the Congolese rebel group, M23, to its list of sanctioned organisations and individuals. The Committee also agreed the listings of two M23 leaders, Eric Badege and Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, as well as of the militia group Forces Democratiques de Libération du Rwanda (FDLR). The UK supports these measures as part of the international community’s response to the crisis in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We remain committed to finding long term solutions which will end the cycle of violence in the DRC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The dialogue needed to resolve the crisis must ensure that all violence stops, that external support to M23 ends and that there is no impunity for M23 commanders and others who have committed serious human rights abuses, including the FDLR. It is also important that the DRC Government shows leadership in addressing the underlying causes of conflict in the East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK, with its partners, will continue to seek ways to support the building of a sustainable peace in eastern DRC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Office for Life Sciences</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>The Office for Life Sciences is part of BIS - it ensures a competitive UK life sciences industry and secures investment.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="strategy-for-uk-life-sciences---one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for UK Life Sciences - One Year On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has launched &lt;a href="/government/publications/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;Strategy for life sciences - One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, a report which summarises progress made in the first 12 months since last year’s launch of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/11-1429-strategy-for-uk-life-sciences.pdf"&gt;‘Strategy for UK life sciences’&lt;/a&gt;. Health Life Sciences is one of the 11 sectors that have been prioritised as part of the government’s industrial strategy. &lt;a href="/government/speeches/strategy-for-uk-life-sciences-one-year-on"&gt;See David Willetts’ speech relating to the report.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategy for UK life sciences is based on three pillars: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a UK life sciences ecosystem: the government is making it easier for researchers to commercialise academic research, placing clinical research at the heart of the NHS, and empowering patients to participate in research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attracting, developing and rewarding talent: the government is introducing measures to attract and nurture world-leading talent and develop scientific excellence (these measures are ensuring that the UK offers exciting and rewarding careers for clinicians, scientists and technicians from all around the world)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcoming barriers and creating incentives for the promotion of healthcare innovation: the government is introducing measures to incentivise early-stage investment and nurture the best innovations through the translational funding gap to a point at which they can secure follow-on investment - we’ll continue to reduce the bureaucracy of setting up clinical trials to ensure that patients have access to promising, cost-effective, new treatments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Year On reports the substantial progress made this year in implementing these measures. In order to strengthen networks between academia, industry and the NHS, the government is investing £1 billion a year through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the NHS. The £180 million Biomedical Catalyst was introduced to bridge the ‘valley of death’ between the bench and the clinic, and the early response from industry is that this funding is already having the intended impact of stimulating innovative research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the progress made to date, One Year On announces the government’s commitment to the sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes from NHS patients over the next three to five years. This work will initially focus on cancer patients, patients with rare diseases and infectious disease. We are working across government to ensure that research, academia and industry are key players in promoting the adoption of genomic technology to provide better healthcare and help the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy for UK life sciences was launched alongside, and is being implemented in collaboration with, the NHS chief executive’s review: [Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating adoption and diffusion in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;. The update to this report, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/12/ihw-creating-change/"&gt;Creating Change: Innovation, Health and Wealth One Year On&lt;/a&gt;, was published on 10 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also published on 10 December 2012 was the latest report on the bioscience and health technology database, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/s/12-p90-strength-and-opportunity-2012-medical-technology-sectors.pdf"&gt;Strength and opportunity 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/sectoropportunities/lifesciences.html"&gt;The New UK Life Science Prospectus Life sciences in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="life-sciences-in-the-uk"&gt;Life Sciences in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has one of the strongest and most productive life sciences industries in the world, contributing to patient well-being as well as supporting growth. UK life science industries generate turnover of over £50bn and employ 167,500 people in over 4,500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry is high-tech, innovative and highly diverse, spanning pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, and industrial biotechnology and has applications across many other sectors. Through the development of innovative medicines, medical technologies and services, its businesses contribute to a stronger and fairer society, helping people enjoy better health, well-being and quality of life. They are also helping the UK improve its sustainability and increase rates of decarbonisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is building on and fostering these strengths and responding to the changing global commercial environment. We want to make the UK the location of choice for pioneering life sciences research and development (&lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt;) and manufacturing investment, so that life sciences will continue to be vibrant in the UK and a key contributor to sustained economic growth and health improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office for Life Sciences (&lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;) works closely with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, championing biotechnology and the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. We also work with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukti.gov.uk"&gt;UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk"&gt;Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)&lt;/a&gt; and other departments, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (&lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; and the life sciences industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="views-on-the-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research"&gt;Views on the use of animals in scientific research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ipsos MORI report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/i/ipsos-mori-views-on-use-of-animals-in-scientific-research-september-2012.pdf"&gt;‘Views on the use of animals in scientific research’&lt;/a&gt; presents the findings of a 2012 survey on awareness of, and public attitudes towards, the use of animals in scientific research. This survey has been carried out since 1999 on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that 85% of the representative sample conditionally accept the use of animals in scientific research. While this year’s findings show a decline in overall public acceptance, it also identifies that a significant proportion of the representative sample (40%) would like to know more information about the use of animals in scientific research before forming a firm opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has challenged the scientific community to respond to these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="areas-of-work-for-the-ols"&gt;Areas of work for the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the &lt;abbr title="Office of Life Sciences"&gt;OLS&lt;/abbr&gt; is focused on 2 areas: healthcare and the bio-economy. The healthcare team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pharmaceutical&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medical technology – devices and diagnostics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bio-economy team works with the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agricultural biotechnology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These teams work across a range of policy areas supporting business growth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHS market access&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;finance and tax&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bio-economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="nhs-market-access"&gt;NHS market access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Te market access team works closely with the other &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; teams, the Department of Health, and other departments and agencies. The NHS is a major contributor to economic growth, and we work together to maximise this contribution and to address any barriers to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main areas of interest for the market access team are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reforms to the NHS, including the introduction of value-based pricing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the NHS procurement strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;engaging with &lt;abbr title="Department of Health"&gt;DH&lt;/abbr&gt;’s delivery of [‘Innovation, health and wealth: accelerating uptake and diffusion of innovation in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_131299"&gt;NHS’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we are considering how these will create opportunities for the business environment and support the growth agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="innovation"&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our focus is to ensure that industry has the right environment to innovate and in particular to remove barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently focusing on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="regenerative-medicine"&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the impact of the £25 million &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukrmp.org.uk/"&gt;UK Regenerative Medicine Platform&lt;/a&gt; which addresses the technical and scientific challenges associated with translating promising scientific discoveries in this area towards clinical impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contributing to the House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into Regenerative Medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="medicines-licensing"&gt;Medicines licensing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the government’s commitment to consult on an Early Access Scheme for Medicines &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exploring more progressive approaches to medicines regulations, including adaptive licensing, through the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; Expert Group on Healthcare Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="clinical-trials-environment"&gt;Clinical trials environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working with the &lt;abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"&gt;MHRA&lt;/abbr&gt; on the European Commission’s plans to replace the European Clinical Trials Directive with a Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="open-innovation"&gt;Open innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the changing &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; landscape and a growing interest in new ways of partnership working, we organised a seminar on Open Innovation in May 2012. Relevant public sector organisations including the Intellectual Property Office, Technology Strategy Board, Clinical Practice Research Datalink as well as private sector interest (AstraZeneca (PPT, 2.6 Mb), Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson discussed the opportunities of the approach to the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-projects"&gt;Infrastructure projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is co-funding 2 key investment projects to stimulate further growth and address market failures by providing incubation facilities for new companies. These bioincubators are based in Stevenage in Hertfordshire, alongside the GlaxoSmithKline &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; headquarters, and on the Edinburgh BioQuarter site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has also co-funded the Industrial Biotechnology 10,000 litre Demonstrator in Wilton, an open access facility to enable companies, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, to trial different biomass feedstock and processes to manufacture biobased products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stevenage-bioscience-catalyst"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.stevenagecatalyst.com/"&gt;Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; will be the first purpose-built, open innovation campus for drug discovery and development. It will maximise the economic impact of academic and science expertise and foster a successful open innovation model between big pharmaceutical and small bioscience companies. It will act as a catalyst to position the UK at the forefront of scientific innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst will be located alongside the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) &lt;abbr title="research and development"&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/abbr&gt; Headquarters in Stevenage and is being developed in stages. Phase 1 comprises the construction of BioIncubator and Accelerator buildings for early-stage bioscience companies. Phase 1 is being funded by &lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;, the East of England Development Agency (EEDA), the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), GSK and the Wellcome Trust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future phases will bring the catalyst up to 45,000 square metres by 2016, assuming that the market demand is as expected. This is forecast to create 1500 new jobs and stimulate the creation of up to 5 new businesses. All future phases will be commercially funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="edinburgh-bioquarter---bioincubator"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter - BioIncubator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.edinburghbioquarter.com/"&gt;Edinburgh BioQuarter&lt;/a&gt; is a landmark life sciences hub that is establishing Edinburgh and Scotland as one of the world’s top 10 centres for biomedical research and commercialisation. The project is a long-term life science property and commercialisation partnership between Scottish Enterprise, the University of Edinburgh, the NHS and US-based private sector partner, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. The 100-acre site already houses the University of Edinburgh Queen’s Medical Research Institute and the 870-bed Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh teaching hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department of Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and Scottish Enterprise are co-funding the creation of the BioIncubator. This investment is expected to leverage almost £210m of additional investment and create or retain over 700 high-value jobs. This will enhance the global reputation of the UK as a place for leading life science innovation, by creating an infrastructure for supporting industry to collaborate with academic and clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Edinburgh is aiming to produce 18 new life sciences companies over the next 5 years which will add a considerable pipeline of demand for the BioIncubator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="industrial-biotechnology-demonstrator"&gt;Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in Wilton in the Tees Valley, the new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk-cpi.com/industrial-biotechnology/demonstrator"&gt;National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator&lt;/a&gt; is an open access facility of a unique scale of 10,000-litre working volume capacity. The demonstrator has 2 main applications: it can be used as a proof of concept facility to scale-up the production of materials to near commercial levels; and as a product manufacturing facility for clients experiencing temporary capacity restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Industrial Biotechnology Demonstrator"&gt;NIBF&lt;/abbr&gt; will allow biotechnology companies to de-risk product and process development. By exploring and then optimising processes, companies will be are able to calculate the most cost-effective combination of materials; process steps and sequences; and the equipment needed to manufacture profitably. Consequently, they will minimise the risk of investing in the wrong capital equipment, using inefficient processes or facing unexpected costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Innovation standardisation</title>
    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>Effective standardisation encourages innovation and forceful competition and improves profitability.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="standardisation"&gt;Standardisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation helps innovation to be applied to the whole economy and makes sure that most companies are not too far behind the early adopters of new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation can help business by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing better access to markets &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering measurable benefits when used within the infrastructure of a company itself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;minimising business costs and risks &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;streamlining internal processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improving communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By promoting interoperability, standardisation provides a competitive edge in the market place; necessary for worldwide trading of products and services. In particular for SMEs, demonstrable compliance with an accepted standard can replace the power of a big brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-standardisation"&gt;What is standardisation?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standardisation includes the development of the standard as well as how it is used. End-users should have confidence in their purchase because the supplier has used an appropriate standard and has gone through independent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="biss-role-in-standardisation"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;’s role in standardisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is responsible for UK government policy on everything to do with standards-making, accreditation and conformity assessment. We will strengthen the standards, accreditation and conformity assessment infrastructure so that it meets the needs of UK industry and to make the processes more relevant and business friendly. We sponsor, and work closely with, the British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the UK National Standards Body (&lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt;) and the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the National Accreditation Body (&lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the European Commission (EC) we help develop European standardisation policy, which can remove barriers to trade. This includes the recent EC regulation on accreditation and market surveillance, and the EC decision on a common framework for marketing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also the central contact point for Directive 98/34/EC that requires member states to notify the EC of proposed national technical regulations; and Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment; and Refusals of Mutual Recognition Decision 3052/95/EC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work closely with technical regulations colleagues and also a number of other government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD’s &lt;abbr title="(UK Defence Standardization"&gt;DStan&lt;/abbr&gt; (UK Defence Standardization) works to develop, facilitate and communicate UK MOD standardisation policies, standards, procedures and guidance on standardisation both nationally and internationally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="standardisation-infrastructure"&gt;Standardisation infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conformity assessment helps companies demonstrate that they have met customers’ needs and includes activities like testing, inspection and certification. The organisations that test, inspect, etc, are known as Conformity Assessment Bodies (&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt;). &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; works to make sure conformity assessment in the UK is well managed, competent and market driven, and so contributes to the productivity and competitiveness of UK businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; notified to the Commission under the European New Approach legislation are known as Notified Bodies (&lt;abbr title="Notified bodies"&gt;NBs&lt;/abbr&gt;). Where there is European Community legislation, the requirements for &lt;abbr title="Notified bodies"&gt;NBs&lt;/abbr&gt; makes sure that products and services assessed in one member state can be accepted in another. However, where there are national regulatory requirements, conformity assessment requirements can differ from country to country and can create barriers to trade. Our work on the quality and conformity assessment infrastructure helps to reduce these barriers by providing ways that allow recognition of conformity assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has produced a guidance document for regulators, on the conformity assessment aspects of European Decision 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products. It deals with the requirements for notification of &lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; and conformity assessment procedures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="accreditation"&gt;Accreditation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accreditation is given when a conformity assessment body is recognised as competent to carry out specific tasks. It is generally accepted that for an accreditation body to be authoritative it must have the support of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A statement of the main principles relating to conformity assessment policy in the UK, including accreditation, has been developed and was first published in May 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="standards"&gt;Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards are the the most important point of the infrastructure, providing the matrix in which the other elements operate with &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;, playing an important role in developing standards domestically and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a toy maker the chances are you will wish to manufacture your toy so that it meets the relevant international and national standards - this will help you sell your product in the UK as well as overseas. To demonstrate to buyers that your product really does meet the standard you will need to employ an independent and impartial third party to assess your product against the standard. These third parties are known as conformity assessment bodies (&lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t want to use any old organisation, but a CAB who you know to be competent and whose assessment will be universally accepted. National Accreditation Bodies (NABS) - &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is the UK’s &lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt; - assess the &lt;abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies"&gt;CABs&lt;/abbr&gt; against international standards to make sure that they are competent to assess against specific standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NABs are reviewed to make sure that they are competent by taking evaluations by their peers and by being subject to government audit and appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This infrastructure provides confidence, trust and assurance to consumers and purchasers that the toy meets the standard that the manufacturer claims it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="non-accredited-certification"&gt;Non-accredited certification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; is aware that some certification bodies and certification body representative associations are concerned at the increase in the number of UK organisations offering non-accredited certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, have a look at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/c/12-759-conformity-assessment-and-accreditation-policy.pdf"&gt;Conformity Assessment Accreditation Policy&lt;/a&gt;  on Accreditation and Conformity Assessment, and specifically to section 3.4 on the application of the accreditation principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In applying these principles, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommends Conformity Assessment Bodies to be accredited by the National Accreditation Body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recommends UK businesses, government and local authorities requiring third party conformity assessment services to source such services, where they exist, from conformity assessment bodies accredited by a National Accreditation Body.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; has further advised certification representative organisations in the UK that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only get ‘accreditation’ (in the UK) from United Kingdom Accreditation Service through the regulation. Any organisation that is suggesting it is accredited in the sense of the regulation when they are not, is likely to be guilty of an offence under the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008 (Statutory Instrument 2008/1276).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certification bodies or representative organisations should refer these cases to trading standards or the Office of Fair Trading in the first instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance"&gt;EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and market surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation will, for the first time, establish a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 4(1) of Regulation 765/08 required that &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; appoint a single National Accreditation Body (&lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;) for the United Kingdom. The Accreditation Regulations 2009 (Statutory Instrument 2009 No. 3155), laid in Parliament on 3 December 2009, appointed the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;) as the UK’s &lt;abbr title="National Accreditation Body"&gt;NAB&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/contents/made"&gt;statutory instrument&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/memorandum/contents"&gt;explanatory memorandum&lt;/a&gt; are available from the legislation.gov.uk website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In support of this statutory instrument, &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; signed, on 8 December 2009, a revised memorandum of understanding with &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="implementation-of-eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance-in-the-united-kingdom"&gt;Implementation of EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and Market Surveillance in the United Kingdom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation established a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drafts of both the statutory instrument and &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt; were tabled at the &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; Policy Advisory Committee on 1 October 2009 as well as being circulated to the &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; conformity assessment consultation group (ConCAss). While the main interest in these documents is contained within these 2 groups, they were open for comment to the public in general, and a copy is available below. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;’s response to the comments received was made on 25 November 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="british-standards-institution-bsi"&gt;British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work in this area covers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the government’s general policy on matters relating to standards-making (but not on the individual standards)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the government’s relations with the British Standards Institution (&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) and its funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s standards development work, including support for delegations representing the UK at overseas standards meetings and for consumer representation in standards-making activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer representation is vital in influencing the standards to reflect the needs and expectations of the general public for things like safety and security, labelling, accessibility, fairness and redress.  More can be found about consumer representation and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services"&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s Consumer and Public Interest Network on the &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; itself is an independent body, established by Royal Charter in the 1920s, although its origins go back to 1901. Its HQ is at Chiswick. More information can be found on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt;’s own website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills recognise that, whilst the process of developing standards facilitated by &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; in the UK is a voluntary activity, there is a public interest in standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A revised memorandum of understanding (&lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;) between &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the department was signed on 20 June 2002. The main changes from the previous &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt; included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incorporation of main points from the joint statement of the public interest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recognition that &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; has significant commercial businesses outside its &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; functions, and focuses on the relationship between the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; and non-&lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; sides - this has meant defining a ‘ring-fence’ both in terms of the use of public funds and in the precedence of the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; as a whole&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an indication of a willingness in principle to provide government support if the &lt;abbr title="UK National Standards Body"&gt;NSB&lt;/abbr&gt; runs into major difficulties&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strengthening of the international and European context, including a specific reference to standardisation policy developed by the Council of the EU&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear encouragement to &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; to develop their standardisation business beyond traditional ‘full’ standards in response to new technology, globalisation, etc, coupling this with a specific obligation to avoid ‘new products’ spreading at the expense of full standards in circumstances where the new features of full standards are still required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Memorandum of Understanding (&lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;), provides a framework for &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and the government to meet the challenges to the UK’s standards-making infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h3 id="funding"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; standards work is provided in 2 main ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as direct financial support to &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; (which is linked to specific deliverables)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as help to those involved in the standards preparation work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="schemes"&gt;Schemes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Assisted International Travel Scheme provides a contribution towards the travel costs of the leaders of committee delegations to overseas standards meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Consultancy Drafting Scheme allows the &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; technical committees to use an outside expert to help prepare the first draft of a standard that is needed quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the consumer travel expenses fund contributes to the travel costs of consumer representatives in national and overseas committees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a condition on approval of funding of &lt;abbr title="British Standards Institute"&gt;BSI&lt;/abbr&gt; and standards-making activities in 2000-2001, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry requested that a study be carried out of the economic benefits of standardisation, in particular of the government’s financial support for standardisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Swann of Manchester Business School, conducted this study, beginning with a review of the literature in this particular field. The report of his study is available below in English, French and German, along with an update from May 2010 exploring developments and progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="united-kingdom-accreditation-service-ukas"&gt;United Kingdom Accreditation Service (&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a &lt;abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding"&gt;MoU&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is recognised as the sole UK organisation for the accreditation of certification, testing and inspection bodies to the EN 45000 and ISO 17000 series of standards. These bodies - the Conformity Assessment Bodies - in turn certify, test and inspect companies’ systems and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; is licensed by &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; to use and confer the national accreditation symbols (formerly national accreditation marks) which symbolise government recognition of the accreditation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; and accredited organisations is available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/"&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification bodies and companies registered by &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification bodies are listed in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.tso-quality.co.uk/qaregister/subscriber/about.htm"&gt;United Kingdom Register of Quality Assessed Companies published by the Stationery Office.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of conformity assessment bodies. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;-accredited certification, testing and calibration and inspection reduces the need for suppliers to be assessed by each of their customers. &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt;’ involvement in international groups provides mutual recognition that reduces the need for multiple assessments of suppliers and as a helps to reduce barriers to trade. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; therefore recommends the use of &lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; accredited conformity assessment services whenever this is an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service"&gt;UKAS&lt;/abbr&gt; also assesses potential Notified Bodies on behalf of &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; and other government departments according to the principles established by &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="recent-ec-legislation"&gt;Recent EC legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance [EC 765 of 2008]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EC Decision on a common framework for the marketing of products [EC 768 of 2008]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;have received approval, following a review of the new approach. These are complementary and both aim to improve the free movement of goods within the internal market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulation puts accreditation into a legal framework in the EEA, enhancing confidence in conformity assessment by strengthening the role of accreditation. It will also reinforce market surveillance structures to protect citizens from unsafe products (including those from outside the EU) and helps compliant businesses by removing those products from the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision, which will not have direct effect in member states, will set a formal framework for future European legislative proposals that fall within its scope. The scope is very broad for both proposals and includes all products subject to community harmonisation legislation (with notable exceptions such as food and medicines). The decision contains additional measures that will be integrated into the legal framework as specific legislative proposals are brought forward. This will clarify commonly used procedures and terms (which are often used differently) so that all stakeholders can be clear on relative responsibilities. In addition there are new rules to enhance confidence in CE marking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="eu-notification-requirements-goods-and-electronic-services"&gt;EU notification requirements: goods and electronic services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="directive-9834ec"&gt;Directive 98/34/EC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Notification requirements for goods and electronic services is known as the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 98/34/EC (as amended by Directive 98/48/EC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive applies to ‘information society services’ (ie services supplied at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services), and to all industrially manufactured products and agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive aims to prevent new technical barriers to trade being created and has a procedure for providing information on technical standards and regulation. It applies to all member states, the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), EFTA (Switzerland) and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="technical-regulations"&gt;Technical regulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulations that need notification have to be notified to the commission in draft, and generally observe a 3-month ‘standstill’ period before the regulation is made or brought into force. This is so that the  commission and member states can raise concerns about potential barriers to trade. If a notified regulation is considered as a barrier to trade, a detailed opinion may be submitted and this will extend the standstill period for a another 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; acts as the central unit for the UK, administering the notification procedure on behalf of government departments and receiving other member states’ notifications for onward transmission to the relevant department. Government departments involve industry as appropriate in their comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="directive-9834---a-guide"&gt;Directive 98/34 - a guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directive 98/34 sets up a legal mechanism, which requests member states to notify the commission and the other members of their technical regulations, at a draft stage, where amendments can still be introduced and a standstill period of 3 months observed before the draft technical regulation (except for urgencies, fiscal and financial measures) is adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="case-study-non-notification-of-technical-regulations-under-directive-9834ec--video-recordings-act-1984"&gt;Case study: non-notification of technical regulations under directive 98/34/ec – video recordings act 1984&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2009 there was a great deal of negative press coverage when it was discovered that the provisions of the Video Recordings Act 1984 were unenforceable as a result of the UK’s failure to notify the measure under Directive 98/34/EC. It was made clear that, because of the unenforceability of the regulations, legislation that would protect under 18s from unsuitable videos - potentially containing violent or sexually-explicit material - was never enacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although non-notification of technical regulations falling within the scope of Directive 98/34/EC is not a major issue in the UK, the consequences of any failure to notify can be serious and steps have been taken to make sure that this situation does not arise again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the non-enforceability of the Video Recordings Act was discovered, the relevant legislation was notified to the European Commission in September 2009 (notification 2009/0495/UK - The Video Recordings Act 1984 (as adopted by the Video Recordings Bill) and The Video Recordings (Labelling) &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;amp;iNumber=0495&amp;amp;"&gt;Regulations to be made under section 8 of the adopted 1984 Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed in December 2009 by the related notification 2009/0664/UK - &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;amp;iNumber=0664&amp;amp;"&gt;The Digital Economy Bill (extract of five clauses and a Schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2009 a joint Cabinet Office/&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; letter was sent to Permanent Secretaries reminding government departments of the need to comply with the provisions of Directive 98/34/EC. &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; followed this up in early 2010 with a letter to Directive 98/34/EC policy leads, drawing attention to a request in the Cabinet Office/&lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; communication of October 2009 for all government departments to carry out an assessment of all technical regulations they had made since 1983 for compatibility with the directive, in order to ensure that all relevant legislation had been correctly notified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Cabinet Office and &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; letters of late 2009 and early 2010, government departments carried out their assessments as requested. Although we received confirmations that regulations compatible with Directive 98/34/EC had been notified, further instances of non-notification came to light. The following are examples of notifications submitted as a result of assessments revealing failure to comply with the directive as required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;amp;iNumber=0318&amp;amp;sCountry=UK&amp;amp;"&gt;2010/0318/UK - PAS66:2009 Official identification eartags for sheep and goats – Specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;amp;iNumber=0319&amp;amp;sCountry=UK&amp;amp;"&gt;2010/0319/UK - 2010/0319/UK - PAS44:2009 Official identification for cattle – Specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson learned from the above is that it is very important for all government departments to constantly check any proposed new legislation for notifiability under Directive 98/34/EC, and notify any compatible regulations in draft before making them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notifications-and-comments"&gt;Notifications and comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-the-notification-system-works"&gt;How the notification system works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is based on member states consulting each other and the commission before they adopt technical regulations and to modify their drafts if necessary. The directive requires member states to communicate to the commission any draft technical regulation which they plan to adopt using the notification form available on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each member state has a central contact point for the directive which coordinates notifications of new national technical regulations as well as those received from other member states, as well as responses to the notifications. The UK contact point is in the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and can be contacted by email: 9834@bis.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new technical regulation is notified, the notification form (in pdf) is completed by the department proposing the measure, specifying the content and reasons for its enactment. The completed form is then sent to the central contact point for processing and forwarding to the commission, together with the draft text of the regulation to be notified, impact assessment if one is available and other relevant documentation that would help the commission and other member states in assessing the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission then sends all the information communicated by the notifying member state to all the other member states and allocates a 3-month standstill period. The date of receipt by the commission of the draft national technical regulation communicated by a member state and of all the requested documents is the beginning of the 3-month standstill period during which the member state concerned is strictly obliged not to adopt the draft notified regulation. During this standstill period, the commission or member states can respond with comments or a detailed opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When notifications from other member states are received, the central contact point forwards them to the lead department and other departments with an interest, providing an opportunity to submit comments or detailed opinions if they feel this is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="when-to-send-comments"&gt;When to send comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are sent when the notified text, although in accordance with community law, raises issues of interpretation or calls for details of the arrangements for its implementation. They can also give an overall assessment of the measure, having regard to the general principles of community law and policies implemented in this context, or inform the member state of its future obligations with regard to acts to be adopted on a community level. Comments do not extend the initial 3-month standstill period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responding-to-comments"&gt;Responding to comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the directive, the notifying member state has no formal obligation to reply to the comments received. In practice, however, member states frequently do so on a voluntary basis and generally take account of comments they receive. All responses to comments should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="detailed-opinions"&gt;“Detailed opinions”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed opinions are sent by the commission or the member states when they consider that the draft measure envisaged would, if adopted, create obstacles to the free movement of goods, the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment of service operators within the internal market. These detailed opinions seek to obtain an amendment to the proposed measure, in order to remove at source any resulting barriers to such freedoms. A detailed opinion received on a notification extends the initial 3-month standstill period by another 3 months, ie to a total of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="responding-to-a-detailed-opinion"&gt;Responding to a detailed opinion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Member states must reply to a detailed opinion addressed to them by the commission or another member state. Although the directive does not specify the time allowed for reply, it is nevertheless desirable that a response be made as soon as possible in the interests of efficiency, preferably during the standstill periods of 6 or 4 months, respectively for goods and information society services. All responses to detailed opinions should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="confirmation-that-a-member-state-is-free-to-make-a-regulation-once-the-standstill-period-has-ended"&gt;Confirmation that a member state is free to make a regulation once the standstill period has ended&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation is received from the commission. Once a standstill period for any particular notification has ended, the originator is free to make the regulation provided that no comments or opinions have been received and/or there are no issues still outstanding as result of a detailed opinion. It is a good idea to check with the central point just after the standstill period has ended, in case any last minute comments or opinions have been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="national-regulations-and-notification"&gt;National regulations and notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only those technical regulations that come within the scope of the directive require notification and there are certain exceptions allowed in the directive. The directive defines what is a ‘technical regulation’ and it is very wide in scope, for example it includes codes of practice and voluntary agreements so government departments have to check whether the regulations they wish to enact come within the scope of notification. If they do, the department should notify the regulations at a draft stage and observe the standstill period before adopting the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-if-a-regulation-is-not-notified"&gt;What if a regulation is not notified?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission can initiate infraction proceedings for failure to notify a national regulation that comes within the scope of the directive. If in doubt measures should be notified in draft since a non-notified measure which should have been notified will be unenforceable. It is not possible to make a notification if a regulation is already in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central contact point in &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; will be happy to give you further information or answer your queries. In addition to the information that is already available on our website, you may also find the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/index_en.htm"&gt;Commission’s website on Directive 98/34/EC&lt;/a&gt; helpful from where you can download reference documents for example, the text of the Directive, Commission’s guidance document, their reports on the functioning of the Directive and case law as well as the ability to search their database of notifications already made by member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="submitting-a-notification"&gt;Submitting a notification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For government departments or agencies wishing to know more about the directive and the notification system, guidance for officials is also available. Government departments or agencies should use Form A (below) with the associated guidance document for notifying proposed technical regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employee Ownership and Share Buy Backs - Consultation on implementation of Nuttall Review recommendations</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The Nuttall Review on Employee Ownership recommended (Recommendation V) that the Government should review and consult on changes to deregulate the conditions under which companies can: authorise share buy backs; finance share buy backs; and hold shares ‘in treasury’.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on deregulatory changes to the conditions under which companies can authorise and finance the repurchase of its own shares, and hold these shares once repurchased. The regulation of share buy backs is governed by the Companies Act 2006. Changes to these regulations, such as those proposed in this consultation would require changes via secondary legislation. The draft regulations attached below indicate how the government would implement these changes. Through this consultation we would also like to understand the implications for companies, employees, and other shareholders. In particular we wish to ensure there are no unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;h3 id="aviation-technology"&gt;Aviation technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS supports the aerospace and defence sector on a wide range of technology activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS ensures the international regulations and standards that are developed to minimise the impact of civil aviation are adequate, fair, contribute to the aviation industry’s sustainability and are not in conflict with the legitimate interests of UK aerospace industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires policy development, co-ordination of research activities, environmental model development, project environmental assessment and environmental forecasts and scenarios. Close co-operation takes place with the Department for Transport, which takes technical advice from us. We co-operate with the International Civil Aviation Organization, European Civil Aviation Conference expert panel on the Abatement of Nuisances Caused by Air Transport (ECAC/ANCAT), United Nations Economic Commission For Europe (UNECE), and the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aerospace-msc-bursary-scheme"&gt;Aerospace MSc Bursary Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 9 July 2012 at the Farnborough Airshow, the Prime Minister announced funding for 500 Masters-level degree places in aerospace engineering over the next three years – from 2013 to 2014 onwards. The places will be jointly funded with industry, with government committing £3 million, and will help provide industry with the next generation of skilled engineers they need. The programme will be overseen by the Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Aeronautical Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information on the bursary scheme will be available soon on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raeng.org.uk"&gt;Royal Academy of Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://aerosociety.com"&gt;Royal Aeronautical Society&lt;/a&gt; websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aerospace-business-leaders-and-aerospace-growth-partnership-groups"&gt;Aerospace Business Leaders and Aerospace Growth Partnership Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aerospace Business Leaders Group is the senior engagement forum to discuss issues of strategic importance affecting the sector. The Group is chaired by the Secretary of State for BIS and also attended by the Minister for Business and Enterprise and senior BIS officials. Industry is represented by a small group of the UK’s top aerospace business leaders. Having identified key strategic issues, such as barriers to growth and key competitiveness drivers, action will be taken forward through an Aerospace Growth Partnership group, chaired by the Minister for Business and Enterprise, with wider business representation across the supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/r/12-954-reach-skies-strategic-vision-uk-aerospace.pdf"&gt;Reach for the skies: a strategic vision of aerospace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="repayable-launch-investment"&gt;Repayable launch investment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repayable launch investment is a risk-sharing government investment in the design and development of civil aerospace projects in the UK. The investment is repayable at a real rate of return, usually via levies on sales of the product. Repayable launch investment is permitted for the civil aerospace under the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which charges the Secretary of State with ‘organising, carrying out and encouraging measures for the designing, development and production of civil aircraft.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 25 years the Government has invested £1.7 billion in repayable launch investment projects and during that period £2.7 billion has been received in income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="automotive"&gt;Automotive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="constructionline"&gt;Constructionline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owned by BIS, Constructionline is a contributor to the Rethinking Construction initiative. It is the UK’s register of pre-qualified construction contractors and consultants. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.constructionline.co.uk/static/"&gt;Constructionline&lt;/a&gt; is designed to streamline pre-qualification procedures, to save valuable resources in the construction industry, rendering it more efficient and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="green-construction-board"&gt;Green Construction Board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grasping the opportunities for growth presented by a sustainable construction, infrastructure and property sector is the main priority for the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.greenconstructionboard.org"&gt;Green Construction Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board, co-chaired by Minister of State for Business, Rt Hon Michael Fallon MP and President and CEO of Skanska UK, Mike Putnam, is focused on taking a unified approach to the problems facing the industry, providing strategic leadership on key issues and identifying steps to promote the UK’s excellence in green construction. The Board will also work to promote the message that a ‘green’ construction sector can lead to business opportunities and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="purpose"&gt;Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as monitoring the delivery of this Action Plan, the Board is also updating and refreshing actions going forward and takes collective responsibility for leading the change to a low carbon economy. The Green Construction Board will look more widely at green property and construction issues, encompassing priority activities of the Strategy for Sustainable Construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="low-carbon-construction"&gt;Low carbon construction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An innovation and growth team was establised in 2009 to review the construction industry to ensure it was ‘fit for purpose’ for delivering a low carbon future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review looked at the strengths of and opportunities for the UK construction industry in a low carbon economy and considered how the UK can be a world leader in this sector. This review was led by Paul Morrell, the Chief Construction Adviser, and was undertaken by a mix of industry experts and those with wider business experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="construction-statistics"&gt;Construction statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS Construction Market Intelligence (CMI) has responsibility for the collection, analysis and publication of statistics on the construction sector. We provide regular statistical analyses of building materials and overseas trade, price and cost indices and key performance indicators for the construction industry. As well as statistical advice, we work closely with economists in BIS to assist in the assessment of the construction market and in the formulation of efficient policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2010 BIS launched its ‘Growth Review Framework for Advanced Manufacturing’. The Framework document was an invitation to provide comments and evidence to help identify the challenges and barriers to manufacturing growth, to feed into the Growth Review process. The document set out the Government’s ambitions for manufacturing, developed through consultation with industry. It was supported by in-depth economic analysis and a statistical annex in order to provide a substantial evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bis-retail-strategy"&gt;BIS Retail Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS has developed a range of sector specific objectives which will be taken forward over the course of 2012 to 2013. These objectives have been developed to facilitate growth of the sector at a local, national, European and international level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/b/12-1197-bis-retail-strategy.pdf"&gt;BIS Retail Strategy&lt;/a&gt;  was developed with input from the British Retail Consortium, the Association of Convenience Stores and Gloucestershire First (the first Local Enterprise Partnership Retail Pathfinder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="retail-policy-forum"&gt;Retail Policy Forum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Retail Policy Forum (RPF - chaired by BIS’s Retail Unit) enables a representative cross-section of retailers, and their representative bodies, to talk to Government Departments and EU officials about regulations and other key policies affecting the sector at an early stage in the process. It aims to help both retailers and policy makers by minimising the burdens on retail, looking for alternatives to regulations (where appropriate) and making any regulations and enforcement as practical and sensible as possible. The RPF meets three times a year. When necessary, additional meetings are held to take an in-depth look at particular subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Retail Unit also manages a Virtual RPF of UK retailers, trade associations and others with a professional interest in retailing. Communications are mainly by email and members can join the RPF’s working groups. To apply for membership of the Virtual RPF please email the Retail Unit explaining your interest in the sector and supplying contact details, including job title, telephone number and postal address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="healthy-high-street"&gt;Healthy High Street?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/h/10-1224-healthy-high-street.pdf"&gt;Healthy High Street? A healthcheck for high streets and town centres&lt;/a&gt;  was published in November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide is a simple to use health check to alert retailers and others to early signs of potential decline in their High Street – and to do so in good time for them to take preventative action. It then offers some useful first steps, including advice on working together with others to rejuvenate the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-portas-review"&gt;The Portas review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2011 the Prime Minister announced that he had asked Mary Portas, leading retail marketing consultant, to undertake a review of the English high street. The report was published in December 2011: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/p/11-1434-portas-review-future-of-high-streets.pdf"&gt;The Portas review: an independent review into the future of our high streets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/2120019.pdf"&gt;government’s formal response to the recommendations made by Mary Portas&lt;/a&gt; in her report was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government in March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="understanding-high-street-performance"&gt;Understanding high street performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIS has also published a report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-1402-understanding-high-street-performance.pdf"&gt;Understanding high street performance&lt;/a&gt;, which explores the many factors impacting on the economic and social performance of town centres and High Streets. This study is intended to help inform government and local authority decision-making regarding town centres, high streets and local economic growth.

    <title>Make it your New Year’s resolution to help get rough sleepers off the streets</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>People setting their New Year’s resolutions can now pledge to offer practical help to rough sleepers in 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk urged anyone wanting to get help for someone sleeping rough to use the new StreetLink hotline and website to ensure they are put in touch with the local agencies offering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He argued that while people want to offer help to those facing homelessness, they often don’t know where to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But StreetLink, run by charities Homeless Link and Broadway with support from Government, offers a “valuable alternative” to a cash handout for people sleeping rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-second-night-out"&gt;No Second Night Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those looking to offer help can call 0300 500 0914 or go to &lt;a href="www.streetlink.org.uk"&gt;www.streetlink.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; to put those facing sleeping rough in touch with local charities and councils who can them get them long-term support and safe accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister argued this new and innovative service helps support the No Second Night Out initiative as it is extended across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In London, where No Second Night Out has been adopted, 70% of rough sleepers have not spent more than one night on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The New Year offers many of us an opportunity to make a new start -  StreetLink offers that opportunity to those facing the prospect of living on our streets and a valuable alternative to simply a cash handout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would urge anyone looking to set themselves a New Year’s resolution to use this service to ensure people sleeping rough in their area get the support they need to get off the streets and into a stable home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZBIXCl1UwE"&gt;Mark Prisk on rough sleeping and Streetlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driving this New Year's Eve? Try a mocktail</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Department for Transport has produced a number of non-alcoholic cocktail recipes to help designated drivers celebrate in style.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is encouraging drivers to opt for non alcoholic ‘mocktails’ in a bid to cut down on drink driving this New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has produced a number of recipes – from a Berry Breezer to a Piña Banana – to appeal to those who are designated drivers on nights out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is also warning party-goers to plan their way home in advance so they can celebrate the New Year in style, not in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting television advert highlighting the consequences of drink driving has been shown throughout December as part of the Department for Transport’s THINK! drink drive campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our message is clear: have a great New Year’s Eve, don’t risk the consequences of drink driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you get behind the wheel after drinking you risk losing your licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, 280 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. Do not let 1 selfish and foolish decision ruin your or another family’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, drivers aged between 20 and 24 failed more breath tests than any other age group. This year’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign is aimed at young people who are shown to be consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures. THINK! advises planning your journey home well in advance and treating your designated driver to a non-alcoholic Christmas cocktail. The recipes are easy to make at home and provide a festive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is currently consulting on a package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers. This includes removing drink drivers’ rights to demand a blood or urine test. This is because evidence shows it is used as a delaying tactic by drivers caught over the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also supported Coke’s designated driver scheme, which offered buy 1 get 1 free soft drinks in pubs around the country throughout December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACPO lead for roads policing, Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Millions of people will be heading out for New Year’s Eve celebrations and we would ask the public to play their part in remaining safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen hundreds of people die from drink driving this year and it has to stop. Innocent people are needlessly dying on our roads and people who make the decision to drive after taking alcohol or drugs are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are someone who drinks and drives, by making a decision to stop in 2013 could save someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is provisionally estimated that 2011 saw 280 deaths, 1,290 serious injuries and 9,990 total casualties directly related to drink driving incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign budget totals £783,925&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Approach to Charging</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Part of the government response to the consultation on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, now known as the Public Data Group (PDG).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government launched a formal consultation on 4 August 2011 to look in detail at key questions on the data policy for a Public Data Corporation, which since the Autumn Statement in November 2011 is now known as the Public Data Group (PDG). The consultation questions focused on: charging, licensing and regulatory oversight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the initial government response to the consultation, published in March 2012, the government committed that it “will continue to consider the options for charging including those set out in the consultation and will report back by the end of 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, based on information supplied by the Public Data Group Trading Funds (Companies House, Land Registry, Met Office and Ordnance Survey) the following slides have been put together to clarify the approach to charging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides provide an overview of the regulatory and guidance framework, the differences between the Trading Funds which underpin their approach to charging and an overview of the current charging models including reference to some of the work being undertaken to respond to changes in the end markets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Public Data Group’s commitment to ongoing collaborations and sharing of best practice, we will continue to build on this work and focus on developing appropriate frameworks and guidelines to help deliver new charging models relevant to the Public Data Group Trading Funds and their respective markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the announcement on 7 September 2012 that the Government would introduce a Brown Field Allowance (&lt;abbr title="Brown Field Allowance"&gt;BFA&lt;/abbr&gt;), &lt;abbr title="HM Treasury"&gt;HMT&lt;/abbr&gt; has circulated a note (below) giving further information on the &lt;abbr title="Brown Field Allowance"&gt;BFA&lt;/abbr&gt; qualification criteria and the process for &lt;abbr title="Brown Field Allowance"&gt;BFA&lt;/abbr&gt; cost verification. Companies undertaking incremental projects that might be eligible for a &lt;abbr title="Brown Field Allowance"&gt;BFA&lt;/abbr&gt; are advised to ensure they are familiar with this process if they wish those projects to qualify for the allowance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="fallow-reviews-2012"&gt;Fallow reviews 2012&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, DECC is unlikely to be able to carry out the fallow block reviews that have been a fixture for September since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that fallow listings will be compiled before year end and sent to licensees for review and discussion, but formal meetings will only be requested where considered necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallow discoveries discussions have been set up by the relevant field teams, particularly for those discoveries publicised on the web in January 2012. The exploration team will be contacting the licensees of released blocks in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any company who would welcome discussion on the technical aspects of their licences should contact Jen by email &lt;a href="mailto:Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fallow process is still producing results for DECC and its partners in PILOT. The 13th release in 2012 added ten new fallow blocks and two new fallow discoveries to the list, bringing the total number of fallow discoveries to 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blocks and discoveries are considered fallow after three years. They are classed B and released if the current licensees are no longer able to progress towards activity due to either misalignment within the partnership, failure to meet economic criteria, other commercial barriers, or a combination of these. Fallow B discoveries that have been released for two years and fallow B blocks released for one will be relinquished if there are no agreed plans for significant activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h3 id="fallow-blocks"&gt;2012 fallow blocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 10 released fallow B block subareas that must have significant plans for activity agreed by the department or be relinquished by 31 December 2012. Many of these have producing fields or discoveries on the block, but it is the area outside the field or discovery area that now needs significant activity. Seven of these blocks were on old licences issued before the 5th Round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fallow-discoveries"&gt;Fallow discoveries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 14 fallow B discoveries on the listings, including 12 that were previously released – some for a second time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are 9 “rescued” fallow discoveries, which now have a substantive work programme agreed with DECC. These are: 13/21a-1A, 15/21a-7, 15/21b-47, 15/22-16, 15/29a-3, 21/20a-5, 21/20b-4, 49/09a-5 and 98/07-2.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no new seismic has been acquired. Two fallow discoveries have had appraisal drilling (30/01c-3 and 30/02-1).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;five field development plans on previously fallow discoveries have been approved: Devenick, Clipper South, Falcon, Ensign and York.  Three of these are on 1st Round Licences, which required a short term licence extension.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thirteen fallow discoveries have been relinquished or are in the process of relinquishment, including two on 2nd Round licences (9/10b-1 and 53/05a-8Z). The others include; 4/26-2, 9/23a-30Z, 9/23a-30, 9/19-4, 9/19-3, 44/27-1, 43/25a-2W, 3/07-3, 28/03-1B, 22/19-1 and 206/02-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="update-on-blocks-released-in-2011"&gt;Update on blocks released in 2011&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well was drilled on one block subarea released in January 2011 (2/5-27). Three of the 11 block subareas placed on the release list in January 2011 are now being totally relinquished, with one more January 2011 released block subarea being partially relinquished back to existing fields or discovery areas. Five of the January 2011 fallow B block subareas have now been “rescued” (an asset transfer (operatorship) is in progress, or firm plans for significant activity that will result in a drill or drop decision within one year have been agreed between DECC and the licensees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, three exploration or appraisal wells were drilled that targeted prospects on previously Fallow blocks or subareas: 2/05-27, 14/26a-9 and 30/2a-9. Since the PILOT fallow process began in 2002, 122 exploration or appraisal wells targeting prospects on fallow B Blocks have been drilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="re-licensing-of-fallow-b-blocks"&gt;Re-licensing of fallow B blocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 of the blocks offered for award in the 26th round were previously fallow blocks or subareas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35 of the blocks awarded in the 25th round were previously fallow blocks or subareas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52 previously fallow blocks were re-licensed in the 24th round.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;68 blocks that had been considered fallow B at some time since 2002 were re-licensed in the 23rd round.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the 22nd round, 10 previously fallow blocks were awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the 21st round, six previously fallow blocks were awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in a particular asset, you should initially approach the named contact (normally the operator) but may also approach partners to see if they are interested in a plan for significant activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further information on the fallow process, contact Jen Brzozowska, Exploration Manager, on 0300 068 6030 or at &lt;a href="mailto:Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
