    <title>Driving this New Year's Eve? Try a mocktail</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Department for Transport has produced a number of non-alcoholic cocktail recipes to help designated drivers celebrate in style.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is encouraging drivers to opt for non alcoholic ‘mocktails’ in a bid to cut down on drink driving this New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has produced a number of recipes – from a Berry Breezer to a Piña Banana – to appeal to those who are designated drivers on nights out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is also warning party-goers to plan their way home in advance so they can celebrate the New Year in style, not in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting television advert highlighting the consequences of drink driving has been shown throughout December as part of the Department for Transport’s THINK! drink drive campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our message is clear: have a great New Year’s Eve, don’t risk the consequences of drink driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you get behind the wheel after drinking you risk losing your licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, 280 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. Do not let 1 selfish and foolish decision ruin your or another family’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, drivers aged between 20 and 24 failed more breath tests than any other age group. This year’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign is aimed at young people who are shown to be consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures. THINK! advises planning your journey home well in advance and treating your designated driver to a non-alcoholic Christmas cocktail. The recipes are easy to make at home and provide a festive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is currently consulting on a package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers. This includes removing drink drivers’ rights to demand a blood or urine test. This is because evidence shows it is used as a delaying tactic by drivers caught over the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also supported Coke’s designated driver scheme, which offered buy 1 get 1 free soft drinks in pubs around the country throughout December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACPO lead for roads policing, Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Millions of people will be heading out for New Year’s Eve celebrations and we would ask the public to play their part in remaining safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen hundreds of people die from drink driving this year and it has to stop. Innocent people are needlessly dying on our roads and people who make the decision to drive after taking alcohol or drugs are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are someone who drinks and drives, by making a decision to stop in 2013 could save someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is provisionally estimated that 2011 saw 280 deaths, 1,290 serious injuries and 9,990 total casualties directly related to drink driving incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign budget totals £783,925&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Fallow blocks and discoveries</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="fallow-reviews-2012"&gt;Fallow reviews 2012&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, DECC is unlikely to be able to carry out the fallow block reviews that have been a fixture for September since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that fallow listings will be compiled before year end and sent to licensees for review and discussion, but formal meetings will only be requested where considered necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallow discoveries discussions have been set up by the relevant field teams, particularly for those discoveries publicised on the web in January 2012. The exploration team will be contacting the licensees of released blocks in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any company who would welcome discussion on the technical aspects of their licences should contact Jen by email &lt;a href="mailto:Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fallow process is still producing results for DECC and its partners in PILOT. The 13th release in 2012 added ten new fallow blocks and two new fallow discoveries to the list, bringing the total number of fallow discoveries to 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blocks and discoveries are considered fallow after three years. They are classed B and released if the current licensees are no longer able to progress towards activity due to either misalignment within the partnership, failure to meet economic criteria, other commercial barriers, or a combination of these. Fallow B discoveries that have been released for two years and fallow B blocks released for one will be relinquished if there are no agreed plans for significant activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h3 id="fallow-blocks"&gt;2012 fallow blocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 10 released fallow B block subareas that must have significant plans for activity agreed by the department or be relinquished by 31 December 2012. Many of these have producing fields or discoveries on the block, but it is the area outside the field or discovery area that now needs significant activity. Seven of these blocks were on old licences issued before the 5th Round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fallow-discoveries"&gt;Fallow discoveries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are 14 fallow B discoveries on the listings, including 12 that were previously released – some for a second time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are 9 “rescued” fallow discoveries, which now have a substantive work programme agreed with DECC. These are: 13/21a-1A, 15/21a-7, 15/21b-47, 15/22-16, 15/29a-3, 21/20a-5, 21/20b-4, 49/09a-5 and 98/07-2.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no new seismic has been acquired. Two fallow discoveries have had appraisal drilling (30/01c-3 and 30/02-1).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;five field development plans on previously fallow discoveries have been approved: Devenick, Clipper South, Falcon, Ensign and York.  Three of these are on 1st Round Licences, which required a short term licence extension.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thirteen fallow discoveries have been relinquished or are in the process of relinquishment, including two on 2nd Round licences (9/10b-1 and 53/05a-8Z). The others include; 4/26-2, 9/23a-30Z, 9/23a-30, 9/19-4, 9/19-3, 44/27-1, 43/25a-2W, 3/07-3, 28/03-1B, 22/19-1 and 206/02-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="update-on-blocks-released-in-2011"&gt;Update on blocks released in 2011&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well was drilled on one block subarea released in January 2011 (2/5-27). Three of the 11 block subareas placed on the release list in January 2011 are now being totally relinquished, with one more January 2011 released block subarea being partially relinquished back to existing fields or discovery areas. Five of the January 2011 fallow B block subareas have now been “rescued” (an asset transfer (operatorship) is in progress, or firm plans for significant activity that will result in a drill or drop decision within one year have been agreed between DECC and the licensees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, three exploration or appraisal wells were drilled that targeted prospects on previously Fallow blocks or subareas: 2/05-27, 14/26a-9 and 30/2a-9. Since the PILOT fallow process began in 2002, 122 exploration or appraisal wells targeting prospects on fallow B Blocks have been drilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="re-licensing-of-fallow-b-blocks"&gt;Re-licensing of fallow B blocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 of the blocks offered for award in the 26th round were previously fallow blocks or subareas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35 of the blocks awarded in the 25th round were previously fallow blocks or subareas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;52 previously fallow blocks were re-licensed in the 24th round.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;68 blocks that had been considered fallow B at some time since 2002 were re-licensed in the 23rd round.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the 22nd round, 10 previously fallow blocks were awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the 21st round, six previously fallow blocks were awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in a particular asset, you should initially approach the named contact (normally the operator) but may also approach partners to see if they are interested in a plan for significant activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further information on the fallow process, contact Jen Brzozowska, Exploration Manager, on 0300 068 6030 or at &lt;a href="mailto:Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Jen.Brzozowska@decc.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Army's airborne engineers build French connection</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>An exercise has seen British airborne engineers build a bridge over a large man-made lake and train with their French counterparts.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/royalengineers/role/834.aspx" title="23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault)"&gt;23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault)&lt;/a&gt; has been working in the harsh climate and unforgiving landscape of Northumbria with French troops from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/presentation/organisation-des-forces/genie/17e-regiment-du-genie-parachutiste" title="17e Regiment du Genie Parachutiste"&gt;17e Regiment du Genie Parachutiste&lt;/a&gt; (17e RGP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise Eagle Sapper tested troops in a humanitarian relief operation in a country facing famine and struggling to recover from damage caused by a tsunami, with government control undermined by insurgents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deploying from their base at Woodbridge in Suffolk, the exercise started in earnest with the use of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/royalengineers/equipment/705.aspx" title="Air Portable Ferry Bridge"&gt;Air Portable Ferry Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (APFB) equipment to move vehicles and personnel across the two-mile-wide (3.2km) expanse of Kielder Water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APFB specialist equipment is designed to be parachuted or moved by helicopter and set up either as a conventional bridge or a self-propelled ferry to cross wider obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sappers preparing the bridge" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1134/16x-2012-115-0114.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sappers preparing the bridge to go over Kielder Water during Exercise Eagle Sapper [Picture: Corporal Obi Igbo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sappers then moved to Otterburn, where they were challenged to build water supply points capable of providing 40,000 litres of drinking water every day, cross rivers using bridging equipment and improvised materials, demolish obstacles, and construct defensive positions which were then attacked by enemy forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training was intended to test the unit in their role providing combat engineering support to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/12409.aspx" title="16 Air Assault Brigade"&gt;16 Air Assault Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, which is ready to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice for operations ranging from disaster relief to war-fighting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Jason Hones, Commanding Officer of 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Exercise Eagle Sapper has seen our soldiers working for up to 22-hours-a-day on demanding tasks that test both their combat engineering and infantry skills in very harsh terrain and weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Water supply point" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1135/16x-2012-115-0631.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The sappers and their French counterparts built a water supply point capable of providing 40,000 litres of drinking water every day during Exercise Eagle Sapper on Otterburn Ranges  [Picture: Corporal Obi Igbo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that we test the mettle of the soldier we are going to send on operations in arduous and unknown conditions so that we know he can cope with anything that is thrown at him. If a soldier can survive in Northumbria in winter he can survive anywhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French troops joined the exercise as part of the developing partnership between 16 Air Assault Brigade and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/presentation/organisation-des-forces/brigades/11e-brigade-parachutiste" title="11e Brigade Parachutiste"&gt;11e Brigade Parachutiste&lt;/a&gt; (11e BP), which have been tasked to develop a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for contingency operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lt Col Hones said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re really lucky to have soldiers from our French partner regiment with us, having recently sent troops over to train in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Working together on this exercise is developing our integration at the section level, to learn how we each operate and our particular strengths and weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will take this to the next level up in the coming months, working towards the aim of being able to work seamlessly together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Matthieu Le Puloc’h commanded the ten-strong 17e RGP contingent, who lived and worked with their British counterparts throughout the two-week exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is our first joint training and our presence is about learning how 23 Engineer Regiment works so that, if we do go on operations together, we know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A sapper from 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault) defends his position" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1137/16x-2012-115-0804.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of similarities in our basic role as airborne engineers, but our equipment and working practices are different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Otterburn is a cold and hard environment but we have quickly adapted to it and the exercise has been a great experience to broaden the minds of our soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Steve McCann said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s been a tough exercise in difficult conditions that has been made more challenging by working with our French counterparts. Their kit is slightly different and the language barrier makes everything go a little bit slower, but we’re showing them how we work and it’s rewarding to complete engineering tasks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Military urge generous public not to swamp postal system at Christmas</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Service personnel are urging members of the public to avoid sending unsolicited Christmas gifts and packages to operational theatres.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Christmas post deadline of 3 December approaches for Armed Forces personnel serving overseas, servicemen and women are urging members of the public not to send unsolicited gifts and packages to operational theatres such as Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these kind sentiments are appreciated, such generosity has often resulted in delaying important mail from family and friends reaching their destination at this special time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceFor/ServiceCommunity/BFPO/BritishForcesPostOffice.htm" title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;British Forces Post Office&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;) is overwhelmed by the generosity of the public who send individuals, and groups, in operational theatres boxes of treats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although well-intentioned, the message is very clear: if people wish to show their support for those serving in Afghanistan, there are far more effective ways of doing so such as donations to Service charities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafbrizenorton/" title="RAF Brize Norton"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Brett Duxbury said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As with every year, the Christmas post period is by far our busiest. Just this week we dispatched more than 10,500 bags of mail to operational theatres, which will arrive in time for Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unsolicited mail can seriously impact on our ability to deliver post from loved ones to personnel serving on operations at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We do not underestimate the impact that mail from friends and family can have on morale and it is for that reason we make it our priority each year to ensure it arrives on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parcels are coming in thick and fast to the military’s premier transport hub of &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton, via the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, and have been loaded onto aircraft ready for dispatch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Service personnel are working hard to ensure that this mail is delivered alongside other vital supplies such as helicopters, armoured vehicles and lifesaving equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Danny Smith, from No 1 Air Mobility Wing at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the last two days over 23 tonnes of mail has arrived at Brize Norton from the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, which has been loaded onto aircraft and is now en route to various operational theatres including Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a challenging but important task ensuring it is all dispatched quickly. Having served in Afghanistan at Christmas last year, I understand how much value our boys and girls place on receiving post from people closest to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Christmas mail for the troops" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1242/Mail1g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Christmas mail for the troops, sorted, bagged and packaged, awaits final transportation to Afghanistan in the air cargo hangar at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton [Picture: Steve Lympany, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of mail arriving at Camp Bastion for onward distribution to other locations in Afghanistan can cause other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onward delivery of goodwill parcels to forward operating bases necessitates additional resupply flights and convoys, which places Service personnel at additional risk in what is already a difficult and dangerous operating environment. Every time an additional convoy is laid on, more troops are put at risk of enemy attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of items included in many welfare parcels are either already readily available in theatre or are simply not appropriate for the Afghan environment. Not only does this mean that the items go to waste, but time and resources have to be diverted from crucial operations to organise their disposal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Mark Francois, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Government is dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces, particularly those deployed on operations. This is reflected in the Deployed Welfare Package, a key part of which is the safe and timely delivery of free personal mail from family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past this mechanism has been used by the general public to show their support and resulted in huge volumes of unsolicited goodwill parcels being sent, which have overwhelmed the in-theatre postal and logistics capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst unsolicited mail is well-intentioned, mail sent by families and friends is the most important to deployed personnel and is our absolute priority. Moreover, unsolicited mail strains the logistics supply and prevents mail from families getting through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For this reason the MOD will be repeating its unsolicited mail campaign. Rather than sending their own letter or parcel, I would encourage people to make a donation to one of Britain’s excellent Service charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They might also consider &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk4u.org/" title="uk4u Thanks!"&gt;‘uk4u Thanks!’&lt;/a&gt; - a charity that provides Christmas gifts to deployed Service personnel. Once again I would like to say thank you to the British public, on behalf of the MOD and Armed Forces, for their incredible support of our serving personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Christmas mail for the troops" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1243/Mail2g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mail for troops in places such as Afghanistan awaiting loading onto aircraft at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton [Picture: Steve Lympany, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the charity uk4u Thanks! will, for the ninth year, deliver a Christmas Box of practical gifts and treats to every soldier, sailor and airman deployed overseas - in Afghanistan and elsewhere - and to those in hospital and recovery centres in time for 25 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its parcels are delivered via the supply chain, meaning there is no impact on the mail network. Although the charity benefits from corporate sponsorship, it also needs donations from the public to continue its work bringing Christmas cheer to thousands of personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the MOD provides a comprehensive Deployed Welfare Package which includes a free mail service for families and friends, 30 minutes of telephone calls a week and internet access, there are still areas where life in an operational theatre can be improved over and above that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, and in order to enable members of the public to make a contribution to the welfare of personnel in an appropriate way, the MOD Operations Welfare Fund was established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priority for spending from the fund is set by commanders in theatre for those items which have the most impact on enhancing the morale of their personnel, and any money donated to this fund enables commanding officers on the ground to bid for items which their men and women have asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of items purchased through the fund are Wii handsets, portable DVD players, games and table tennis tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone wishing to make a donation can send a cheque to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations Welfare Fund, J1 Operation HERRICK, PJHQ, Sandy Lane, Northwood, Middlesex HA6 3HP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last recommended Christmas posting date for personnel on Her Majesty’s ships is Friday 30 November 2012, and for Operation HERRICK and Operation KIPION is Monday 3 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary>DECC encourages all parties to follow the voluntary industry code of practice on access to upstream oil and gas infrastructure</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Infrastructure Code of Practice sets out principles and procedures for negotiating third party access to oil and gas infrastructure on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="guidance-on-upstream-oil-and-gas-infrastructure-access-dispute-resolution"&gt;Guidance on upstream oil and gas infrastructure access dispute resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access for developers of offshore oil and gas fields to upstream infrastructure for the purpose of transporting and processing hydrocarbons is a key element in the process of extracting the UK’s petroleum resources. Companies seeking access for their hydrocarbons to such infrastructure must apply in the first instance to the relevant owner of the infrastructure in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a third party is unable to agree satisfactory terms of access with the owner of the upstream oil and gas infrastructure, the third party seeking such access can – and under the terms of the Infrastructure Code of Practice may be obliged to – make an application to the Secretary of State to require access to be granted and to determine the terms on which it is to be granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DECC’s Guidance on disputes over third-party access to upstream oil and gas infrastructure sets out the requirements and obligations on all parties. It also sets out the approach DECC would take in handling applications and the principles DECC would expect to be guided by in determining terms of access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current guidance reflects the third party access provisions of the Energy Act 2011 which came into force on 21 March 2012. DECC will review the guidance in the light of industry comments and the updating of the Infrastructure Code of Practice that is currently in progress. It is expected that DECC’s guidance will be revised if necessary by the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments on the guidance are welcomed. It would be helpful if any proposals for changes include, wherever possible, both reasons and suggestions. For all general enquiries, write to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="uknorway-framework-agreement-1998"&gt;UK/Norway Framework Agreement 1998&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="summary-of-the-agreements-main-provisions"&gt;Summary of the agreement’s main provisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="scope"&gt;Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement relates to pipelines on the continental shelf that cross the UK/Norway boundary and link infrastructure on one side under the jurisdiction of one government to infrastructure on the other side under the jurisdiction of the other government. Please note: Vesterled was not covered by the agreement because the Heimdal facilities on the Norwegian shelf and the Norwegian Frigg pipeline on the UKCS are both under Norwegian jurisdiction. Similarly, pipelines direct from a Norwegian field, for example, to a UK landing terminal, are outside the scope of the agreement because the landing terminal would be on the UK’s land territory and not on the UKCS. The term ‘petroleum’ refers to all liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="licences-authorisations-approvals-and-consents"&gt;Licences, authorisations, approvals and consents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laying and operation of inter-connecting pipelines is subject to authorisations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inlet flange connected to infrastructure on Norwegian shelf, outlet flange connected to infrastructure under UK jurisdiction = Norway grants required authorisation from inlet flange to outlet flange. UK grants required authorisation from median line to outlet flange&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inlet flange connected to infrastructure on UK shelf, outlet flange connected to infrastructure under Norwegian jurisdiction = UK grants required authorisation from inlet flange to median line. Norway grants required authorisation from median line to outlet flange&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;route of all inter-connecting pipelines is subject to consent of both governments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;governments must seek to agree on terms of authorisations before they are granted – arbitration is available if needed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;copies of authorisations must be made available to each government and must not be substantially altered or re-assigned without prior consultation between the governments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;alterations are not to be made that would prevent unified ownership or operation or prevent /impede transport of petroleum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;owner of inter-connecting pipeline must establish arrangements to regulate use of the pipeline in accordance with the agreement – governments may request a copy of any agreements setting out such arrangements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="operator"&gt;Operator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner is to appoint an operator. This must be approved (along with any subsequent change of operator) by both governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the governments is to encourage optimal use of inter-connecting pipelines and take whatever measures they can to assist connections or access to such a pipeline for use to be made of spare capacity (without prejudicing efficient operation for the transport of petroleum owned by the owner of the pipeline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrangements made by the owner to regulate use of the pipeline will include provisions on priorities for transport of petroleum (royalty in kind to get same priority as petroleum from field from which royalty is taken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="dispute-settlement-about-third-party-access"&gt;Dispute settlement about third party access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for dispute settlement sits with the Norwegian Government where the proposed point of entry of petroleum is on the Norwegian shelf and the UK Government where the proposed point of entry is on the UK shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments must consult on dispute settlement, seeking to agree a mutually acceptable response. Arbitration is available if needed. Both governments must apply principles of non-discrimination and fairness for all parties during a dispute, and they must take account of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spare capacity available (allowing for owner’s contractual obligations and reasonably expected usage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technical compatibility of third party petroleum with already contracted petroleum in the pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;economic factors, including costs, tariffs and other conditions applied to use of pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;need not to endanger security of supply or prejudice safety or environmental measures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technical capability and financial viability of third-party applicant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;other matters relevant to either government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government responsible for settling the dispute will take into account consultation with the other government and, at least 21 days prior to informing the applicant of the outcome, inform the other government how it intends to respond. Arbitration is available if needed. The other government shall, on request, give effect to an agreed response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="environmental-protection"&gt;Environmental protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments, jointly and severally, after consultation, will exert every effort to ensure the laying and operation of a pipeline shall not cause pollution of the marine environment or damage by pollution to the coastline, shore facilities, vessels or fishing gear of any country. Competent authorities will develop procedures to implement environmental protection measures in the agreement during an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="safety"&gt;Safety&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments are to consult on common construction and safety standards for inter-connecting pipelines, and to require owners to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="security"&gt;Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing in the agreement is to prejudice special powers in the case of national or international emergencies. Each of the governments are to consult with the other as early as possible for an agreement on measures to reconcile urgency of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="telecommunications"&gt;Telecommunications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competent authorities are to agree on the establishment of operation and control of radio communications relating to inter-connecting pipelines. Other communication systems to be subject as far as possible to common design standards. If there are no common standards, standards of each government shall be compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="exchange-of-information-and-confidentiality"&gt;Exchange of information and confidentiality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments may exchange information received from the pipeline owner as long as it does not conflict with any restrictions on disclosure. Such information received by one government from the other is to be treated as confidential with no further disclosure, but information may be used to prepare general reports. Copies of general reports are to be made available to each government by the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="tax"&gt;Tax&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double taxation convention applies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="metering-system"&gt;Metering system&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality and quantities of petroleum are to be metered (entry and exit) by the pipeline owner. The metering system must be compatible with the metering system of the infrastructure and be properly installed/maintained. Where governments have a legitimate interest in the metering system for quantities of petroleum entering a pipeline, the system shall be subject to agreement between their competent authorities. Competent authorities must agree on regular calibration of the metering system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="inspection"&gt;Inspection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each government must appoint inspectors for safe and proper laying of the pipelines. Inspectors must consult and co-operate. Available measures are to be taken to give respective inspectors access to relevant parts of the pipeline. Inspectors may order cessation of operation without consultation in cases of emergency – reasons are to be reported to the governments, which will then consult to consider action necessary for safe and speedy resu
mption of operations. Competent authorities must consult on inspection matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="continued-use"&gt;Continued use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the governments agree, use and operation of a pipeline shall continue after expiration, surrender or revocation of an authorisation. The Government that had granted the authorisation shall grant a new authorisation or conduct for use and operation of the pipeline itself or take other action as agreed by both governments. Any arrangement established by the owner to regulate the use of the pipeline shall continue to apply, but may be subject to supplementary agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one government considers continued operation of all or part of a pipeline is not practical, the other government must be given the opportunity, in consultation with the owner, to ensure continued operation on fair terms and conditions. Subject to environmental considerations, neither government will prevent the other from securing continued use. Where one government takes over operation, it shall ensure any part of the pipeline no longer in use is removed or isolated if both governments agree on that course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="decommissioning"&gt;Decommissioning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each government shall agree measures to be taken in connection with decommissioning. If the governments agree continued use of all or part of a pipeline is not practical, they shall require the owner to submit a decommissioning plan. The plan will include an estimate of the costs of the measures proposed in it; details of timing of the measures or provisions on how timings are to be determined. The governments, in considering a plan, shall take into account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;best available cost-effective techniques&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;economic factors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;applicable international standards/guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety hazards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety of navigation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;environmental impacts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;impact on other sea users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;timetable for decommissioning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;financial implications and other consequences for either government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;other matters raised by either government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments may approve the plan with or without modifications and conditionally or unconditionally. The owner will be given the opportunity to make representations about any proposed modifications or conditions. The governments will act without unreasonable delay in deciding whether to approve or reject a plan. An approved plan must be implemented. The owner must be informed of the reasons for rejecting a plan and will submit a revised plan with a time limit acceptable to the governments. Arbitration is available if the governments are unable to agree a response to an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="arbitration"&gt;Arbitration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any disputes about the interpretation or application of the agreement, or any other matter referred to the governments for settlement under any agreements between a pipeline owner and a user, will be resolved by negotiation between the governments. If a dispute cannot be resolved in that way, or by any other procedure agreed by the governments, either government may request dispute settlement by an arbitration tribunal composed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each government designates one arbitrator. Both arbitrators elect a third, who will be chairman. They must not be a national of or habitually reside in either country. If either government fails to appoint an arbitrator within three months of a request, either government may request the International Court of Justice appoint an arbitrator. The same procedure applies if, within one month of the designation or appointment of the second arbitrator, the third arbitrator has not been elected. The tribunal will determine its own procedure, except that all decisions must be taken by a majority vote. The tribunal’s decisions are binding on the governments and regarded as agreements between the governments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id="amendment-and-termination"&gt;Amendment and termination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments may amend or terminate the agreement at any time by agreement. Either government may request consultations on an amendment to the agreement at any time; such a consultation is to commence within two months of the request and will be conducted expeditiously. During a consultation, the governments will take full account of the proposals for amendment with the aim of reaching a mutually acceptable solution within the shortest possible time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="guidelines-for-the-completion-of-pipeline-works-authorisations-pwas"&gt;Guidelines for the completion of Pipeline Works Authorisations (PWAs)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Guidance Notes for Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines were published in 1992, there have been some legislative changes. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/825/contents/made"&gt;Pipeline Safety Regulations 1996&lt;/a&gt; were introduced by the Health and Safety Executive; as part of a consolidation exercise, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/17/contents"&gt;Petroleum Act 1998&lt;/a&gt; repealed and replaced the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975 and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/360/contents/made"&gt;Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipelines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations&lt;/a&gt; came into effect in 1999. All have had an impact in the process of making an application for an offshore Pipeline Works Authorisation (&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that either a Pipeline Works Authorisation (&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt;) or &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; Variation should be in place before any construction/modification works of a pipeline or pipeline system begins. It is recommended that, before submitting an application, the prospective owner should informally consult both &lt;a href="mailto:claire.grant@decc.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Pipelines Administration in DECC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/"&gt;Health and Safety Executive&lt;/a&gt; at the earliest possible opportunity, to discuss the proposed scheme and the regulatory requirements involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there are no objections, it takes approximately 4-6 months from receipt of the application to issuing the authorisation. In the case of pipelines in respect of which an environmental statement is required under the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipelines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999, the procedure may take longer in order for all the environmental issues to be properly considered. Operators are therefore urged to submit their applications in good time (at least 4-6 months before construction begins), to meet their deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="consent-and-authorisations---processing-deadlines"&gt;Consent and authorisations - processing deadlines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist operators when submitting an application please see below table regarding end to end processing times for issuing consents upon receipt of a satisfactory application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="consent-processing-time"&gt;Consent processing time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4-6 months&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; (with Median Line)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6+ months&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; Variation (Category 1) (less than 500m or totally within a safety zone)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6-8 weeks&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; Variation (Category 2) (more than 500m or outside a safety zone)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4-6 months&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deposit consent&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6-8 weeks&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any queries should be directed to the Consents &amp;amp; Authorisations Manager &lt;a href="mailto:claire.grant@decc.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;Claire Grant&lt;/a&gt; tel: 01224 254052&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="action-required-by-companies"&gt;Action required by companies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at the design stage, companies should make contact with the Health and Safety Executive Specialised Installations Directorate in Aberdeen for Scottish waters, and the Hazardous Installations Directorate in Norwich for English/Welsh waters (see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/explorationpro/infra_guidance/pipelines/gd_pwa/useful_address/useful_address.aspx"&gt;list of useful addresses&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as soon as the route of the pipeline and basic technical details are known, contact should be made with the Consents and Authorisations Section at DECC EDU-LED in Aberdeen to arrange an informal meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when planning is well under way (e.g. to the extent that it is known whether the pipeline is to be trenched or buried and what type of manifolds are to be used), early contact with local fishing organisations is advised (this gives an opportunity for any problems to be highlighted and hopefully ironed out before the official consultation period.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is important to ensure the application contains all required details (though minor changes may be made at a later stage) and does not contain unnecessary information – particularly in the form of pages of technical drawings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the application should be submitted in good time so the &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; may be issued before construction begins (approximately 4-6 months or longer if the pipeline crosses a median line and there are likely to be treaty issues or where there may be environmental concerns and the possibility of objections is higher).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;applicants should not hesitate to phone the case officer handling their application if they have any query regarding the content of the application or if they require clarification of the relevant legislation/procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the holder of the &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; must ensure the terms of the authorisation are upheld and that DECC is given advance notice of any proposed modifications/variations and of any changes to the names/addresses of the holder/user(s)/operator and owner(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="summary-of-process"&gt;Summary of process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a draft application should be submitted to DECC allowing checks and any additional information to be requested from the company prior to full submission and processing of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the applicant should discuss ‘consent to locate’ requirements with DECC’s Environmental Management Team (&lt;abbr title="Environmental Management Team"&gt;EMT&lt;/abbr&gt;) early in the process. &lt;abbr title="Environmental Management Team"&gt;EMT&lt;/abbr&gt; can be contacted at emt@decc.gsi.gov.uk or on 01224 254045. We are unable to issue a &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; consent unless the ‘consent to locate’ consent has also been approved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the application will be forwarded to consultees for comment (these are generally other government departments, fishing federations and other users of the sea and include other DECC sections). All consults are asked to respond within 28 days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when any queries have been answered, and all consultees are content, DECC will inform the applicant that they are to proceed to public notice. This requires the applicant to publish and make available for inspection details/maps of the project in such publications and at such addresses as may be directed by the Secretary of State for a period of 28 days. The applicant should forward the documents to DECC for review and agreement, prior to publication.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;schedule 2 to the Petroleum Act 1998 sets out the procedure for considering any objections to the application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;once objections have been resolved or if no comments have been received, the Pipeline Works Authorisation may be issued together with additional ‘consent to locate’ as referred to above. The &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; contains the terms under which the pipelines have been approved, which must be adhered to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DECC will inform all consultees of the issue of the &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; and arrange publication of a notice to this effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="definitions"&gt;Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="offshore-pipelines"&gt;Offshore pipelines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Part 3 of the Petroleum Act 1998 an authorisation is required for the construction and/or use of a “pipeline” in “controlled waters”. For these purposes, controlled waters means the territorial sea adjacent to the UK and the sea in any area designated under section 1(7) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Energy Act 2008 defines pipelines as a “pipe or system of pipes (excluding a drain or sewer) for the conveyance of anything, together with all apparatus, works and services associated with the operation of such a pipe or system”. This includes pipelines used for the conveyance of hydrocarbons, water, chemicals, apparatus for the supply of energy for operations, hydraulic control lines or umbilicals, as well as services (for example the provision of fuel or power).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional approvals and consents under The Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipe-lines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999 (As amended), The Offshore Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats) Regulations 2001 (As amended) and Part 4a of the Energy Act 2008 will also be required for their construction/use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (&lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt;) the following should also be noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the construction of pipelines in internal waters will require a Marine Licence and operators should seek advice from the consents team or &lt;abbr title="Environmental Management Team"&gt;EMT&lt;/abbr&gt; as requirements may differ between devolved authorities and dependent on whether the pipeline is associated with oil and gas, carbon capture and storage or gas unloading and storage activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; (2009) provides an order-making power by which the Secretary of State may provide that the provisions of Part 3 of the Petroleum Act 1998 do not apply to a specific pipeline or pipelines of a specified description.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in addition, the &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; (2009) provides a second order-making power which allows the Secretary of State to provide that Part 3 of the Petroleum Act applies to specified pipelines or to pipelines of a specified description where the pipeline is used in connection with exploration for, or exploitation of, petroleum, or the importation of petroleum into the UK and that by virtue of the date when construction of the pipeline was begun, section 14(1)(b) of the Petroleum Act 1998 would not apply in relation its use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id="pipeline-works-authorisation"&gt;Pipeline Works Authorisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Petroleum Act 1998 a “works authorisation” means an authorisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the works for the construction of a pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for such works and for the use of the pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id="holder-of-the-pwa"&gt;Holder of the &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person to whom the authorisation is issued. An authorisation may not be issued to a person other than a body corporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="users-of-a-pipeline"&gt;User(s) of a pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person(s) authorised by the &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; to use the pipeline for the purpose of conveying any fluid, or other, so authorised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="operator-of-a-pipeline"&gt;Operator of a pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person designated by the holder as responsible for organising or supervising the construction or operation of the authorised pipeline in a manner that complies with the authorisation and, inter alia, with any relevant legislation existing at the material time. The works authorisation may name the operator as the holder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="owners-of-the-pipeline"&gt;Owner(s) of the pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person(s) in whom the pipeline is vested; and a person who has the right to use capacity in the pipeline, where such right has been acquired by that person on terms that – (a) he is entitled to use the capacity for a period of one year or more, and (b) the right is capable of being assigned or otherwise disposed of to another person. The Petroleum Act 1998 allows the Secretary of State to make an order, designating a person as the “owner” of a pipeline, after giving the person concerned an opportunity of being heard on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="deposit-of-materials-on-the-seabed-consent-depcon"&gt;Deposit of materials on the seabed consent (DEPCON)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Required before any material e.g. rocks/mattresses are placed on the seabed for the protection or support of a pipeline during construction or maintenance of a pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; must be in place before any Deposit Consent can be issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="checklist-of-application-information"&gt;Checklist of application information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id="cover-no-ring-binders-please"&gt;Cover (no ring binders please)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name of project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;company contact with telephone/fax numbers and email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id="administrative-detail"&gt;Administrative detail&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copy of executive summary from approved field development plan (if applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brief description of project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;licence and block number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;approximate project location from shore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;method of transportation to shore (if applicable)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id="consent-to-deposit-materials-on-the-seabed-depcon"&gt;Consent to deposit materials on the seabed (DEPCON)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The permanent placing or deposition of material for the support or protection of a pipeline e.g. gravel, rock, mattresses or protective pipeline covers, on the seabed during the construction of a pipeline is governed by the Pipeline Works Authorisation. Schedule 2 of the authorisation prohibits any further deposition except with the prior written consent of the Secretary of State. In instances where, as part of a project requiring a &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt;/&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; variation/deposit consent, materials are to be deposited on a temporary basis, please supply a list of the temporary deposits including the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the type of deposit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how long it will be on the seabed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether the deposit will be within or outside a 500m safety zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note: this is for our information only and applications for temporary deposits should still be directed to our Environmental Management Team for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For pipelines that do not have a &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt;, e.g. pipelines constructed prior to the coming into force of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act 1975, any deposition would require a licence under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. However, by virtue of the Petroleum Act 1998 (Specified Pipelines) Order 2011, operators have the option of applying for a &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; for those existing pipelines that were consented before the Petroleum and Submarine Act 1975, therefore precluding the requirement for an &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be worth noting that there may be other circumstances where the operator may choose to apply for an &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; License for specific activities in advance of seeking approval under the Petroleum Act (&lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt;) regime. &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; licensable activities are likely to be primarily related to decommissioning operations, which are not activities exempt under the &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; regime. Advice should be sought from the consents team or &lt;abbr title="Environmental Management Team"&gt;EMT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications for consent to deposit material under a &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; should be made to the Consents and Authorisations Section at DECC on Form Depcon1, together with appropriate (simple) drawing(s) showing where, for example, mattresses are to be placed. Both drawings and Depcon1 form, to show the geographic coordinates (degrees, minutes and seconds format using WGS84 datum, i.e. 00° 00’ 00”.00N, 00° 00’ 00”.00E ) of start and end points.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;location of the proposed site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the following further details are required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the length, width and height above seabed level that the material will attain when deposited&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the approximate date on which deposition is proposed to begin and the approximate duration of the operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consent for a deposition of materials is given, it usually contains terms reserving to the Secretary of State the right to require removal of any materials deposited should they become a potential or actual hazard or obstruction to other seabed users. Removal may also be required at the end of the useful life of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pipeline owner should consult relevant fishing organisations and other seabed users before any operation to deposit materials is begun, and keep appropriate government departments advised of agreements reached (this is usually covered in discussion with the fishermen about the pipeline project as a whole).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that if any preparatory work, e.g. pipeline crossings, are to be put in place prior to the construction of the pipeline, the &lt;abbr title="Pipeline Works Authorisation"&gt;PWA&lt;/abbr&gt; should be requested early enough to undertake this work, otherwise an &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; licence may be required. As stated above, it is only activities “for the purpose of constructing or maintaining a pipeline as respects any part of which an authorisation is in force” which are exempt from the provisions of the &lt;abbr title="Marine and Coastal Access Act"&gt;MCAA&lt;/abbr&gt; Licence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;15 (North East) Brigade joined Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council and its partners for the grand finale this week at the historic signing – just a week after thousands of people lined the town’s streets to welcome home the Light Dragoons from their tour in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The signing of an Armed Forces Community Covenant by the people of Barnsley is the final ceremony that sees all local authorities in my brigade area – representing a population of 7.8 million – pledge their support for their Armed Forces’ communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This achievement, along with the recent signing of the North East Armed Forces Community Charter by the Association of North East Councils, means that the people of Yorkshire, the Humber and the North East are leading the way with their support for the Armed Forces Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="forces-friendly"&gt;Forces friendly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brig Bibby added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barnsley has always been a Forces-friendly town, with the local community supporting military personnel both past and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The covenant will help cement that support at a local level and ensure that our Armed Forces, veterans and their families have the assistance they need and are treated with the dignity they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cllr Steve Houghton, Barnsley council leader, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barnsley is delighted to add its signature to those of a growing number of local authorities across the county. The people of Barnsley have always been extremely grateful and proud of those men and women working in the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our signing of the Armed Forces Community Covenant is an opportunity for us to recognise, formally, our ongoing commitment to support those involved with and leaving the Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces Community Covenant was drawn up in May 2011. It is aimed at building closer ties between military families and the local community within the 11 regional brigades that span the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then just over half of the 430 local authorities that are eligible to sign have made that commitment, with 15 (North East) Brigade – the largest regional brigade in the UK - being the first to get all local authorities within its area to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
