    <title>Foreign Secretary responds to planned new settlements </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK condemns the decision by the Jerusalem District Planning Board to give approval for a plan to build 1,500 housing units in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Ramat Shlomo, and is extremely concerned by reports that the Board is considering giving the approval to a further 5000 housing units in East Jerusalem this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on yesterday’s announcement the Foreign Secretary William Hague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, and I condemn this decision. It is deeply disappointing that despite the international community repeatedly raising our concerns, Israel continues to press ahead with plans to expand them.  Settlements undermine the foundations of a two state solution and trust between the parties.  This decision, which paves the way for the extension of settlements in East Jerusalem, constitutes a serious provocation and an obstacle to peace.  If implemented, it would make a negotiated two-state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital, very difficult to achieve.  We  urge Israel to reverse this decision and take no further steps aimed at expanding or entrenching settlement activity”

    <title>Eric Pickles opens pop-up shop to showcase high street entrepreneurs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the government’s efforts to regenerate high streets and encourage entrepreneurs, the shop is being opened in time for final Christmas present buying this week by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Local Growth Minister Mark Prisk, with the support of national enterprise campaign StartUp Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To directly support enterprise and showcase Britain’s best new retailers, ministers have set up the pop-up store inside their Victoria-based office building to act as a blueprint for high streets across the country to emulate through schemes such as Portas Pilots and Town Teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cutting the ribbon on the pop-up shop" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5697/ribbon-cutting.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Eric Pickles cutting the ribbon with Mark Prisk and Emma Jones, co-founder of StartUp Britain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Pickles unveiled the first ever Whitehall pop-up shop with ‘Apprentice’ winning entrepreneur Tim Campbell. Every fortnight six new British start-up businesses will move into the shop, sharing costs and trialling their exciting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shop will be open to the public for at least a year and will offer affordable retail space to over 150 small start-up businesses. The department is not seeking any financial return from the shop, which is being supported by sponsors Intuit, John Lewis, SNR Denton and StartUp Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inside the pop-up shop" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5698/shop-floor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The first 6 pop-up tenants are NANUKK, Milla &amp;amp; Arti, Arthur &amp;amp; Henry, London Mummy, Morrow’s Outfitters and The English Tee Shop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers believe pop-ups are a great way to get empty spaces used and could be easily replicated in other town centres across the country. Mr Prisk has written to the British Property Federation to urge landlords to get on board. He said that, starting in January, all 27 Portas Pilots and 330 Town Team partners will receive support to facilitate new pop-ups in their empty high street premises, which could support thousands of new businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is committed to rejuvenating the high street. A multi-million pound strategy is backing local partnerships such as Portas Pilots and Town Teams to breathe new life into their town centres. This includes a doubling of small business rate relief; mentoring from retail experts; and workshops to address town centre challenges. A guide to opening a pop-up will be published soon and StartUp Britain has published a tool kit today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is providing over £80 million of start-up loans for young entrepreneurs, which could create over 30,000 new businesses. Ministers are also changing planning restrictions so that landlords can alter how an empty shop is used for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these steps will make it easier for start-ups to find other low-cost stores to set up in. Last year 450,000 people set up new businesses and almost two thirds of new start-ups say they would benefit from trading on the high street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are absolutely determined to support the high street and we know pop-ups are a great way to bring empty shops back to life and get new businesses going, so we thought ‘why not open one right here in the department?’. It will also showcase how we can unleash more of our best and brightest young entrepreneurs onto the country’s high streets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma Jones, co-founder of StartUp Britain, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The PopUp Britain model gives retail entrepreneurs an affordable opportunity to scale up their businesses and become a part of their own high street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing record numbers of people setting up businesses and they are starting out small and online. They are the driving force of the economy. This initiative offers them a chance to physically test out new markets as well as get their products in front of consumers and big buyers in a way that has never been available to them before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By actively encouraging local authorities to give start-ups access to empty shops across Britain, we hope it will help accelerate British enterprise as well as providing a vibrant addition to the local British shopping experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a real appetite in our town centres to get them revitalised so they remain attractive places to visit. And it’s not just talk: there are many extremely capable and serious people with some superb ideas; but they need a bit of help to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pop-up shops are a superb way for all sorts of entrepreneurs to test their ideas. So I’m delighted that this department is opening the first pop-up shop in Whitehall and I look forward to inviting all 27 Portas Pilots and 330 Towns Teams here to see how they could replicate this model across the country in the new year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Apprentice’ winning entrepreneur Tim Campbell added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a brilliant idea and it is great to see the government actively supporting business in this way. For many aspiring and growing enterprises, having access to a retail unit where new propositions and ideas can be tested directly with customers can be the catalyst to increase sales. I hope other landlords follow this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At the Bright Ideas Trust, where we invest in businesses started by young unemployed people, we see many business struggle to secure retail space as they grow out of their bedrooms and away from their kitchen tables.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neKNqnTu6qY"&gt;Pop-up shop event video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="startup-britain"&gt;StartUp Britain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.startupbritain.co/"&gt;StartUp Britain&lt;/a&gt; is a national campaign by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs, harnessing the expertise and passion of Britain’s leading businesspeople to celebrate, inspire and accelerate enterprise in the UK. The campaign was founded by eight entrepreneurs and was launched in March 2011 by the Prime Minister. It has successfully run pop-up stores in Richmond, Surrey, which opened in July and which have already helped 42 businesses get access to the high street. Four in five of the tenants said the experience had been good for their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="first-six-pop-up-britain-victoria-tenants"&gt;First six pop-up Britain Victoria tenants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established 6 months ago by 27-year-old Shrewsbury-based designer Sarah McLeod, silk scarf company &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nanukk.com/"&gt;NANUKK&lt;/a&gt; features beautiful pieces of Art printed onto silk fabrics. All the scarves are made in England. Sarah has been labelled as one to watch, after she was awarded the River Island Graduate Fashion Week Award in 2008. 
Sarah said: “It will be great to have a physical presence in the marketplace at last! So far I’ve only been online. People will love the feel of my silk scarves and I hope it will make them buy. I’m so excited!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.millaandarti.co.uk/"&gt;Milla &amp;amp; Arti&lt;/a&gt; was set up by product design consultant Deborah Reyner 18 months ago. Her British-made homeware collection includes bespoke lavender hearts for weddings, patchwork kits, gift ties and ribbons, collars and bows. 
Deborah said: “This is a wonderful opportunity for Milla &amp;amp; Arti and to talk about my products which are made by the British seaside and get people interested in making and doing themselves. I haven’t been able to sleep for a week before this, I’m so excited!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brother and sister Mark and Clare Lissaman named their ethical organic cotton men’s shirt company after their grafting grandfathers. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.arthurandhenry.com/"&gt;Arthur &amp;amp; Henry&lt;/a&gt; was developed after ethical consultant Clare noticed there were no ethical formal shirts on the market. “I was at the World Congress on Organic Cotton a few years back and realised that although all the men attending were passionate about organic cotton - none were actually wearing any as they were all suited up and couldn’t find proper smart shirts in organic cotton,” Clare, from Islington, said. “So we thought we’d make some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re thrilled and delighted to have this opportunity. For a newly established, ethical menswear brand, this is an amazing opportunity to meet customers face-to-face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single mum and former interior designer Esther Gibbs, from Chiswick, created &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.londonmummy.com/"&gt;London Mummy&lt;/a&gt; after people kept asking her where she bought the cushions and accessories she had made herself. All her products are now either made in England – some by Esther herself - or by women’s collectives in China. Her handpicked selection includes retro bed linen, colourful crochet animals, quirky kids’ stationery, classic toys and games, funky lunchboxes, wall art and more. Esther also makes beautiful children’s fabrics, which she sells in store too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esther said: “I sell online but I’ll sell much more in the shop. Once people understand what the shop is about and what it’s doing for small British businesses, it will be a great asset for the high street and small businesses. I’m delighted to be involved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sock entrepreneur Philip Morrow, 25, started &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.morrowsoutfitters.com/"&gt;Morrow’s Outfitters&lt;/a&gt; last year as a way to re-establish his great-grandfather’s former gentlemen’s outfitters shop that operated in Liverpool between 1912 and 1987. His range of Loughborough-made cotton socks come in over 40 designs and colours. 
Phillip said: “Pop-up shops make a great deal of sense for small online businesses such as mine. I’m over the moon about getting the opportunity to come into PopUp Britain in Victoria.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full-time English teacher and designer Alia Qadir, 30, from Ealing, started &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.theenglishteeshop.com/"&gt;The English Tee Shop&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to combine her passion for fashion and love of grammar! All her cotton is English-made and printed. She sells online and runs her business part-time from home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alia said: “Until now I have relied on my online presence to sell my brand. But my T-shirts are made from a really good quality, soft jersey, and that doesn’t come across online. I’m really delighted about this new pop-up adventure!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="new-town-team-tool-kit"&gt;New Town team tool kit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the prototype shopping concept comes a newly-developed pop-up-specific tool kit for Town Teams to implement, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a national pop-up lease&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a central website with information about the initiative for town teams and new businesses interested in applying for a slot at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.popupbritain.com"&gt;www.popupbritain.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;access to free pop-up payment equipment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a step-by-step guide for setting up a PopUp Britain shop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PopUp Britain branding to make the shop recognisable to the consumer as a place where they can support British enterprise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="portas-pilots"&gt;Portas Pilots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking forward the first recommendation from Mary Portas’s high street review, the department is running a number of high street Town Team Portas Pilots in England. We’re encouraging local partnerships and consortiums to come up with innovative ideas about how to transform their local high street into a social place, bustling with people, services and jobs. Twelve town centres from across England were selected as the first Portas Pilots Town Teams in May, and 15 more in July, with three from London, bringing the total to 27. They each receive up to £100,000 of funding plus support from Government and retail expert Mary Portas. More detail can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-high-streets-and-town-centres"&gt;Improving high streets and town centres pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="town-teams"&gt;Town Teams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 330 Town Team Partners support includes: an advice line and a network of advisers managed by the Association of Town Centre Management; special national events to learn from other Town Teams, and support from industry experts and trade bodies including an online ‘Knowledge Bank’ with expert advice; regular meetings with other Town Teams to share tips and ideas; and ‘Crowdfunding’ - a potential way to attract local investors and raise small amounts of finance to support their work. All Town Team Partners will also benefit from a Government-sponsored fund designed to help towards getting their plans off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/newsroom/1786823/2241696.xls"&gt;List of Town Team Partners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="statistics"&gt;Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key statistics and evidence on start-ups in the UK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011 saw a record high for start-ups: over 450,000 people set up a company
 and became their own boss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a StartUp Britain poll revealed 82% of start-ups found the pop-up experience was valuable for their business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in the UK, there are 4.8 million private sector companies employing an estimated 23.9 million people with a turnover of £3,100 billion. Small and medium-sized enterprises also account for almost half of the net growth in jobs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium, 11.3% of shop premises in UK town centres are now vacant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;according to research from StartUp Britain, 63% of businesses not already on the high street think their business would benefit from a high street presence and, of these, 88% believe funding is the biggest barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="additional-quotes"&gt;Additional quotes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke Johnson, Chairman of StartUp Britain, former Pizza Express boss and Chairman and part-owner of Patisserie Valerie and Giraffe, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A new high street name that will become synonymous with buying British and supporting small British enterprise is a fantastic idea. I’m sure PopUp Britain will be embraced by town planners and local government as a way to offer tangible support to their own high streets and start-up communities.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Russell, Chief Executive of WeArePopUp, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pop-ups are ideal incubators for the next generation of entrepreneurs. It’s very encouraging to see the Government opening a national showcase in a high-profile location such as Cardinal Place in Victoria. Pop-ups can change the fortunes of local communities and we look forward to this support encouraging more landlords to open up their empty shops and become part of the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosie Cann, Director at Popupspace, a property consultancy that specialises in pop ups, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We find space for lots of established retailers, but the challenges for new businesses wanting to open shops are much wider. What we have here is a unique offering to smaller start-ups looking for affordable space to sell, but also for business support and a high profile.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Little, UK Managing Director of Intuit, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pop-up tenants need to be able to accept card payments but it can take weeks to get set up, the equipment and transactions can be expensive and require long-term contracts. Intuit is proud to support PopUp Britain with Intuit Pay, giving start-up retailers a way to get set up in minutes to securely take card payments on their smart phone or tablet – with no commitment and no contracts. With Intuit Pay anyone can now accept card payments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos of the shop are available from the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/sets/72157632269606220/"&gt;DCLG Flickr channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Preventing and reducing anti-competitive activities</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-issue"&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive markets are the best way of making sure a country’s resources are put to their best use. They encourage enterprise and widen choice for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-competitive activities can develop in any economy. They can harm consumers and stifle innovation and growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of an anti-competitive activity would be when two companies agree to charge the same price for a similar product. This protects the companies’ profits but means consumers get less choice.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-competitive activities can be very bad for consumers. That’s why they have to be identified and stopped as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the government’s three growth objectives is that the UK should become the best place to start, finance and grow a business. Reforming and improving the laws on anti-competitive activities is a major part of this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="changing-competition-law"&gt;Changing competition law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is reforming the laws that cover competition and anti-competitive activities in business, including those relating to mergers, markets and illegal activities such as price-fixing and cartels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also reforming the institutions that police competition and anti-competitive activities, and strengthening their powers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These laws, institutions and powers are collectively known as the competition regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="competition-landscape"&gt;Competition landscape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re making changes to the organisations that deal with competition and anti-competitive activities in business. We’re doing this between now and the end of 2014. This work is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers/supporting-pages/consumer-and-competition-landscape-reform" title="Consumer and competition landscape reforms."&gt;Consumer and competition landscape reforms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="setting-up-a-new-watchdog-for-the-grocery-industry"&gt;Setting up a new watchdog for the grocery industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re creating a new watchdog for the grocery industry. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/preventing-and-reducing-anti-competitive-activities/supporting-pages/groceries-code-adjudicator" title="Groceries Code."&gt;Groceries Code Adjudicator&lt;/a&gt; will give suppliers, including farmers supplying the bigger supermarket chains, more protection against anti-competitive activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="making-legal-challenges-easier"&gt;Making legal challenges easier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at ways to make it easier for consumers and small businesses to &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/preventing-and-reducing-anti-competitive-activities/supporting-pages/private-actions-pro-tem" title="Private Action."&gt;challenge anti-competitive behaviour&lt;/a&gt; by bringing a legal challenge (also known as a private action) against anti-competitive activities.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="state-aid"&gt;State aid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re modernising the rules on state aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State aid is when a public body (such as a local authority) or publicly funded body (such as the Big Lottery) provides a business, charity or other organisation with financial help that could give them an advantage over another business. This kind of financial help is generally outlawed by the European treaty, as it’s an anti-competitive practice. State aid regulations set legal ways to give this kind of help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve produced a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-aid"&gt;detailed guide on state aid&lt;/a&gt; for public authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different rules - also covered in the detailed guide - apply to agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, transport and maritime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK competition law has to comply with EU law. Article 101 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/overview_en.html"&gt;Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)&lt;/a&gt; bans any agreements between businesses ‘which have as their object… the prevention [or] restriction… of competition within the common market.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Statutory consultee performance and award of costs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes to amend guidance in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/costs-awards-in-appeals-and-other-planning-proceedings-circular-03-2009"&gt;Circular 03/09: Costs Awards in Appeals and Other Planning Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; in relation to statutory consultees and their advice at appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also announced clarifications to the guidance in relation to local councils and their development plan, and in relation to ensuring evidence submitted at appeal is manifestly accurate and truthful. The government is also requiring the 5 main statutory bodies to report on, and be accountable for their performance on dealing with planning applications as part of their individual Improvement Plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summary of responses was published on 18 December 2012. The report above summarises the key issues raised and provides a revised addendum to circular 03/09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Section 1 provides an overview of the consultation package as a whole as well as proposals on a number of areas including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacing the currently referenced standards in part A (structure) with the new British Standards based on Eurocodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;aligning the existing guidance in Approved Document C (site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture) with the most up-to-date radon maps to ensure the safety provisions are targeted appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarifying the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M (access to and use of buildings)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising the guidance supporting parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to remove unnecessary costs on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making minor changes to the technical guidance in Approved Document B (fire safety) to resolve practical problems in the application of requirement B2 (internal fire spread (linings))&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the intention to take forward the repeal of the fire protection provisions in the Local Acts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the non-regulatory approach proposed in relation to domestic security and changing places toilets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="draft-approved-documents"&gt;Draft Approved Documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published alongside this section of the consultation is a draft version of a new Approved Document K (protection from falling, collision and impact). Not only does this reflect the proposed changes resulting from the rationalisation of parts K, M and N, it also seeks consultees’ views on the proposed new style of Approved Documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new style has also been applied to a draft revised Approved Document regulation 7 which can be found in the main consultation document as annex I.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building regulations: conservation of fuel and power</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper sets out the detailed proposals on part L of the building regulations. It is section 2 of 4 of the 2012 building regulations consultation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes proposals for tighter carbon dioxide emission standards for new homes and non-domestic buildings, to take the next step towards zero carbon standards, plus tighter performance standards for works to existing buildings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper also contains proposals to introduce, on a phased basis, requirements for additional energy efficiency improvements to be carried out when other specified works (eg extensions) are planned and Green Deal finance is available as an option to meet the up-front costs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ministry of Defence art collection </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection consists of over 1,500 items of fine art and antiques including paintings, drawings, engravings, photographs, clocks and furniture. All the items are in public ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection exists through the generosity of donors in the 19th and early 20th centuries who made bequests and gifts to the Admiralty and later, the War Office, then the Ministry of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases the terms of the gift or bequest mean that they may not be sold or otherwise disposed of and the intentions of the donors were that the works should be in public ownership rather than in the private collections of various regimental messes and ward rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection team is responsible for protecting, preserving and conserving these works of art and antiques. In many cases, we display items in the offices of senior officials, in conference rooms and in other public spaces in defence estate buildings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection has its origins in the Admiralty collection. From the early 19th century successive First Lords and Admiralty Secretaries commissioned portraits and donated or bequeathed items from their private collections with the intention of ensuring that their memories were preserved. The army is less well represented because although hundreds of fine works of art have been commissioned and bequeathed, most still belong to regimental messes and are not public property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also few images of the Royal Air Force as most of the significant paintings depicting RAF personnel and activity belong to the RAF museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection is managed to professional standards by a small team who ensure that loan criteria are strictly adhered to and that conservation is carried out where necessary. The team has two main objectives: first, to maintain the safety and preservation of the items in the collection and second, to display this unique archive within defence establishments and residencies and to maximize public access and visibility wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This A to Z includes some of the very best works of art and historic objects in the archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the Ministry of Defence art collection, its provenance and background are presented in a new book and DVD. Selected high quality prints of paintings in the collection are also available for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-birds-eye-view-of-venice-1740"&gt;A Bird’s Eye View of Venice, 1740&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="francesco-guardi-1712-to-1793"&gt;Francesco Guardi (1712 to 1793)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Bird's-Eye View of Venice, 1740" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4724/guardiwhole_960x600.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This magnificent work by Francesco Guardi was painted around 1740. It was one of the many works bequeathed by John Wilson Croker; Secretary to the Admiralty between 1809 and 1830, and the collection’s main benefactor. Recent cleaning was carried out on the painting when some layers of discoloured varnish were removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="admiral-sir-richard-haddock-1629-to-1715"&gt;Admiral Sir Richard Haddock (1629 to 1715)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="john-closterman-1660-to-1711"&gt;John Closterman (1660 to 1711)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Admiral Sir Richard Haddock (1629 to 1715)" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4725/admiral_haddock_480x578.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Admiral Haddock’s legacy is assured within the Royal Navy, perhaps his greatest historical legacy is that his story impressed the Belgian author Hergé sufficiently for the Admiral to be used as the inspiration for a character in The Adventures of Tintin .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admiral Richard Haddock coincides exactly with Hergé’s creation of the fictional Captain Haddock’s flamboyant ancestor Sir Francis Haddock in ‘The Secret of the Unicorn’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the outbreak of the third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672 Richard Haddock became captain of the 100-gun HMS Royal James on 18 January of that year; he was her captain at the Battle of Solebay on 28 May. The Royal James was the flagship of Admiral Sir Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal James led the Blue Squadron and attacked Willem Joseph van Ghent’s ship. She was then engaged by a number of other Dutch warships and fireships. Despite fighting several of them off and forcing Rear-Admiral Jan van Brakel’s ship to disengage, the Royal James was set on fire by the Dutch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admiral Haddock was wounded in the foot and seeing that the ship was doomed attempted to persuade the Earl to abandon ship. Montagu refused and Haddock jumped overboard. He survived to be picked up and transferred to another English warship. Montagu was killed in the wreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haddock returned to London and attended a meeting with King Charles II. There the King bestowed a mark of favour on Haddock for his actions during the battle, taking a satin cap from his head and placing it on Haddock’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bomb-damage-to-hm-customs-house-london-1942"&gt;Bomb damage to HM Customs House. London, 1942&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="alistair-stewart"&gt;Alistair Stewart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bomb Damage to HM Customs House. London, 1942" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4726/customhouse_556x699.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the better known war artists were a small London-based group commissioned to record the effect of bomb damage on well-known buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These artists, employed by the Ministry of Works, were given special access to damaged government buildings - but were hampered by a lack of canvas on which to paint. Alistair Stewart solved the problem by producing paintings such as this one on utility hardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the wartime period a small team of artist-restorers, working for the artists’ section of the Ministry of Works, were responsible for the care and maintenance of public works of art. This team built on a long tradition of employing artists in a dual role as painting conservators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the London Blitz some of these artists were asked to record damage to significant buildings such as the Tower of London and HM Customs House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official war artists commissioned by the War Artists Advisory Committee were all, at this point, deployed out of London, and among the few people available and capable of undertaking the task were Alistair Stewart and William Hampton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="canadian-infantryman-1918"&gt;Canadian Infantryman, 1918&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="augustus-john"&gt;Augustus John&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Canadian Infantryman, 1918" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4727/augustusjohn_487x600.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Infantryman was painted by Augustus John in 1918 when he accepted a commission with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in order to produce a series of war portraits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the very best portraits in the collection, this portrait by Augustus John of a Canadian infantryman is fascinating because like so many of the war artist’s output, the subject’s identity is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we know nothing of the man - nothing of his background, family, attitude towards what he was doing - he takes on an iconic significance. He symbolizes both the victors and victims of war and has become, for the Armed Forces, our universal ‘Unknown Soldier’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is signed and dated on the reverse of canvas, and was donated to the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="capture-of-the-maria-di-giovanna-january-1941"&gt;Capture of the Maria Di Giovanna, January 1941&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rowland-langmaid"&gt;Rowland Langmaid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Capture of the Maria Di Giovanna, January 1941" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4728/giovanni_803x551.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is appropriate that the central collection of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; should contain works of art depicting both 20th century world wars. Activity during the 1939 to 1945 war is widely represented and again the concentration is on naval activity rather than on land campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This watercolour shows HMS Dainty capturing the Italian merchant ship schooner, the SS Maria Giovanna, off Bardia. SS Maria Giovanna was a 255 ton schooner running supplies to North Africa. HMS Dainty was a D-class British destroyer. At the beginning of World War 2 the HMS Dainty joined the Mediterranean Fleet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 1941, when she was cruising off the coasts of Eastern Libya, the HMS Dainty was spotted and bombed by a German aircraft. She was severely damaged and sank off Tobruk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowland Langmaid was born in Canada on 1 December 1897. He was the eldest son of Captain J Langmaid, who was an engineer in the Royal Navy. Langmaid joined the Royal Navy in 1910 and went to sea at the beginning of the World War 1 serving at the Dardenelles in HMS ‘Agamemnon’ where he made official sketches for landings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the war Rowland Langmaid studied at the Royal Academy School and the Royal College of Art. He held exhibitions at the Royal Academy and in London, New York, and Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Langmaid was a highly accomplished engraver as well as a painter in oil and watercolour with a style similar to the famous marine artist W L Wyllie with whom he collaborated in Sea Fights of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Langmaid returned to the active list in 1939 in the rank of Lieutenant Commander and served as official Admiralty artist to the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet from 1941 to 1943.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dawn-at-scapa-flow-december-1918"&gt;Dawn at Scapa Flow, December 1918&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="muirhead-bone"&gt;Muirhead Bone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dawn at Scapa Flow, December 1918" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4777/bonescapa_409x529.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This drawing shows activity on board a British patrol visiting a German battle cruiser, at a time when some of the German Fleet was caged in Scapa Flow, a landlocked anchorage in the Orkneys. The artist was commissioned to record activity in and around the British fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muirhead Bone was a master etcher, draughtsman and war artist who was born in Glasgow. He became the first official war artist in 1916 when he was attached to the intelligence branch of the War Office and sent to France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was commissioned as an Honorary 2nd Lieutenant and toured the western front in a chauffeur-driven car. Working at considerable speed his sketches covered a wide range of subjects, mostly behind the lines, including the work of the medical services, the repair and maintenance of big guns and off duty, war weary soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bone worked in various media - chalk, charcoal, pencil and pen, sometimes adding touches of watercolour later.  Subsequently, Bone illustrated a 2 volume set of books entitled ‘The Western Front’, published in 1917.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muirhead Bone also served as an official war artist in World War 2, by which time he was Sir Muirhead having been knighted by George VI in 1937. Bone was attached to the Admiralty and was not only the first but also the most senior of its artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His work was to become the most widely reproduced official war art of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="design-for-whitehall-new-government-buildings-1936"&gt;Design for Whitehall, New Government Buildings, 1936&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="emmanuel-vincent-harris"&gt;Emmanuel Vincent-Harris&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Design for Whitehall, New Government Buildings, 1936" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4778/walcot_1200x449.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the collection of architectural drawings are designs for churches and barracks, as well as Robert Adam’s Admiralty screen and other Whitehall-based drawings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally providing accommodation for the Board of Trade and the Air Ministry, ‘Main Building’ was built between 1938 and 1959 to designs by the architect E Vincent Harris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; moved into the building in 1964 when the department was reorganised. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This original architectural drawing has hung in the Main Building since its presentation by the architects in 1969. It was rehung in the rotunda area on the building’s re-opening in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tiny carving is one of a set of 5, 15th century Flemish alabaster panels from Chicksands Priory in Bedfordshire.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the site became a defence establishment objects from the priory were sent to a local museum.  Following the recent restoration at Chicksands the museum decided to allow the alabasters to return to their original home. They are the oldest pieces within the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="frederik-hendrik-prince-of-orange"&gt;Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frederik Hendrik was born in 1584, the son of William the Silent. He succeeded his brother Maurits as Stadholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was the grandfather of William III who, with his wife Mary, became joint monarchs in 1689. Van Miereveld was the official court painter to the princes of Orange throughout the late-16th century and his works were very highly regarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thought that when William arrived in England he brought portraits such as this one to give to members of the English establishment - in this case, the Lord High Admiral. The portrait currently hangs in a NATO residence in Holland and its first return to its country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection includes two original architectural Robert Adam drawings - showing front and rear elevations for the screen separating the Admiralty building from Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building, built for purpose by Thomas Ripley in 1725, was thought to be too visible to everyday pedestrians in Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two drawings are extremely light sensitive and are protected with ultraviolet light resistant glazing and currently hang within Admiralty House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activity during the 1939 to 1945 war is widely represented in the collection but the concentration is on naval activity rather than on land campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The works of the war artists were presented to the Admiralty and to the War Office in 1946 by the War Artists Advisory Committee. The works of art shown here are all on display in various conference rooms and senior offices around Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Taranto was a naval battle that occurred on the night of 11 November 1940 during World War 2. The Royal Navy launched the first all-aircraft naval battle in history, flying a small number of aircraft from a single aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean and attacking the Italian fleet at Taranto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowland Langmaid was born in Canada on 1 December 1897. He was the eldest son of Captain J Langmaid, who was an engineer in the Royal Navy. Langmaid joined the Royal Navy in 1910 and went to sea at the beginning of the World War 1 serving at the Dardenelles in HMS ‘Agamemnon’ where he made official sketches for landings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the war Rowland Langmaid studied at the Royal Academy School and the Royal College of Art. He held exhibitions at the Royal Academy and in London, New York, and Paris. Langmaid was a highly accomplished engraver as well as a painter in oil and watercolour with a style similar to the famous marine artist W L Wyllie with whom he collaborated in Sea Fights of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Langmaid returned to the active list in 1939 in the rank of Lieutenant Commander and served as official Admiralty artist to the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet from 1941 to 1943.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the outbreak of the World War 1 Prime Minister Herbert Asquith appointed Horatio Kitchener as Secretary of War. He became the first member of the military to hold the post and was given the task of recruiting a large army to fight Germany. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of a war poster that featured Kitchener and the words: ‘Join Your Country’s Army’, over 3 million men volunteered in the first 2 years of the war. On 5 June 1916 Horatio Kitchener was drowned when the HMS Hampshire on which he was traveling to Russia struck a mine off the Orkneys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is one of a number of sculptures adding a different dimension to the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post of Admiralty Secretary was extremely influential in British politics, especially during the 19th century. Croker, of Irish birth, became Chief Secretary for Ireland and after a series of political coups which assisted the government, was offered the Admiralty Secretary’s job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this capacity he presided over a number of administrative reforms. He is particularly popular with the art collection team because he was one of our greatest benefactors, bequeathing his considerable art collection to the Admiralty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Lawrence was one of England’s greatest portrait painters and his friendship with the sitter is apparent in this sensitive work. This portrait hangs in the dining room of Admiralty House, Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image depicts the Royal Dockyard at Deptford in 1739, during the reign of George II. Deptford was the site of one of four royal dockyards established during the reign of the House of Tudor, the others being Portsmouth, Chatham, and Woolwich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively they helped create the first ships of the Royal Navy after Henry VII realised that it was no longer safe for the nation to depend on privateers and traders to protect England’s shores. Deptford yard probably grew around a storehouse hired at Greenwich, possibly at Deptford Strand, then called West Greenwich, in 1486.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection includes many fine engravings and drawings including some first impressions. These ‘first impressions’ are of extremely fine quality since the engraved lines on the copperplate, from which the engraving was pressed, were sharp. With each subsequent pressing the lines would become gradually less distinct and the value of the finished engraving subsequently lower. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many engravings in the collection are finished by the application of watercolours. All the 18th and 19th century examples, both coloured and monochrome, are extremely sensitive to light and must be displayed in carefully controlled locations under special UV-resistant light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is appropriate that the central collection of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; should contain works of art depicting both 20th century world wars. Activity during the 1939 to 1945 war is widely represented and again the concentration is on naval activity rather than on land campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The works of the war artists were presented to the Admiralty and to the War Office in 1946 by the War Artists Advisory Committee. The works of art shown here are all on display in various conference rooms and senior offices around Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roland Vivian Pitchforth was an official war artist, firstly, for the Ministry of Information, and then later for the Admiralty, under the aegis of the War Artists’ Advisory Committee. In the early months of his appointment he painted coastal boats in action and travelled on convoys to the Azores and Gibraltar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the war Pitchforth was sent out to the Far East, and witnessed the culmination of the Burma campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a temporary captain in the Royal Marines he made numerous watercolours of Colombo Harbour in Ceylon before joining the combined amphibious and airborne attack on Rangoon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his way to the Burmese capital with his commando unit Pitchforth was asked to paint camouflage on to the amphibious craft to minimise the threat of airborne attack, and this proved highly effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This watercolour is particularly interesting for its depiction of ‘dazzle’ painting, a technique designed to disguise the hulls of ships and render them less visible as targets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 18 September 1940 the ‘Gloire’ was intercepted by the British and brought to port in Casablanca where she was neutralized. The artist was commissioned to observe the activity of the Royal Navy in and around the Mediterranean from 1940 to 1944.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The works of the war artists were presented to the Admiralty and to the War Office in 1946 by the War Artists Advisory Committee. The works of art shown here are all on display in various conference rooms and senior offices around Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernard Hailstone belonged to the group of early 20th century artists whose best known work was done during World War 2. He was known for his portraits of royalty, members of the Armed Services, musicians and personalities of stage and screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the most memorable are his portraits of Sir Winston Churchill, Peter Ustinov and Sir John Barbirolli. His portrait of Lord Olivier now hangs in the bar of the Garrick Club. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1941 the War Artists Advisory Committee commissioned Hailstone to paint civil defence subjects. He joined the Auxiliary Fire Services and witnessed at first hand the horrific destruction caused by bombing during the Blitz. He would set up his easel among the bombed London churches and smouldering buildings when there was a lull in the raids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He supplemented these works with portraits of his colleagues in the fire services and other war workers. His work came to the notice of Kenneth Clark, who in 1941 asked him to become an official war artist to the Ministry of Transport. During this period he recorded the life of the Atlantic and Mediterranean convoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the rest of the war Hailstone travelled around the Mediterranean and North Africa recording the activities of the mercantile navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="admiral-horatio-nelson-1st-viscount-1758-to-1805"&gt;Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount (1758 to 1805)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;No introduction to the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection would be complete without mention of Nelson. This portrait by the Neopolitan artist Leonardo Guzzardi hangs in the Admiralty Board Room off Whitehall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was originally owned by Sir William Hamilton. After his death it found its way, via a nephew, to a hotel in Milford Haven - from where it was bought by the Admiralty Board in 1847 in order to balance a portrait of William IV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton said, of this work, “It is, of my friend, the most like”.  Lord Nelson’s physical appearnce has been the subject of scholarly debate for many years.  This portrait is therefore particularly significant in this connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Admiralty Messenger's Badge 1824/5" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4797/badge1_448x604.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section includes some of the very best works of art and historic objects in the archive, all of which have little in common other than the fact that their provenance usually includes, at some stage, the desire of a previous owner that they should come into the care of the Admiralty, the War Office or, more recently, the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection encompasses a number of medals and badges. Among the best are a series of Admiralty Messengers’ badges. This example is one of a set of 4 made between 1820 and 1827. Each badge is hallmarked and carries the London assay mark. Two of the badges have a pendent greyhound made of silver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marker’s mark is identical on all 4 badges, consisting of the letters ‘JA’ in rectangular cartouche, which identifies them as the work of Joseph Angell. The Admiralty Messengers’ badges identified the bearer and acted as a form of guarantee of despatch and delivery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Admiralty ‘large’ pattern badge displays the various royal emblems of different parts of the United Kingdom: the 3 lions of England in the first and fourth quarters, the lion of Scotland in the second and the harp of Ireland in the third. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is surrounded by a garter bearing the motto “Honi soit qui mal y pense” (Evil to him who evil thinks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant paintings of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection are those commissioned by the Admiralty from the artists accompanying the voyages of exploration of Captains Cook and Flinders. The best of these are on loan to the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hodges’s paintings of the Pacific celebrate British exploration. He was appointed by the Admiralty to record the places discovered on Cook’s second voyage, undertaken in the ‘Resolution’ and ‘Adventure’, 1772 to 1775. Cook’s main purpose on this expedition was to locate, if possible, the much talked-of but unknown Southern Continent and further expand knowledge of the central Pacific islands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hodges’ records of coastal profiles were in part important for navigational reasons. This was primarily in the form of drawings, many later converted to engravings in the official account of the voyage. He also completed oil paintings on the voyage but most, especially these larger ones, were painted in London on his return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Resolution’ shown in a wild storm with three waterspouts, off Cape Stephens, the northernmost point of D’Urville Island, at the top of the South Island. The incident took place in May 1773, during Captain Cook’s second voyage to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blackened sky is pierced by flashes of lightning which have struck the Maori ‘pa’, or fortified settlement, precariously balanced on the promontory to the right. Four waterspouts appear to be depicted, the principal one in the left foreground spiralling towards the sky and the others near the ‘Resolution’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="william-westall"&gt; William Westall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cape Townshend and the Islands of Shoal Water Bay" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4799/westalltownshend_529x424.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1801, at the age of 19, landscape artist William Westall found himself aboard the Investigator, the ship that Matthew Flinders was to command on his voyage of discovery to Terra Australis. He, along with a team of artists and botanists produced a splendid visual record of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flinders’ voyage was intended to capitalise on Cook’s discoveries some years earlier. In particular, Flinders was anxious to discover if Australia was bisected by a navigable waterway which would have huge benefits for trade routes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This voyage, however, was not as successful as Cook’s. Flinders explored Shoalwater Bay in 1802, landing on Akens Island (a small island on the western side) and exploring the head of the bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his return to England he produced 9 landscapes. He worked on them for 3 years, completing the last in 1812. Westall shows scenes emphasising the strangeness of the explorers’ discoveries, as can be seen from this painting, which hangs in Admiralty House, Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westall never fulfilled his early promise of becoming mainly a book illustrator. He died in 1850 aged 68.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This engraving, after the famous Dance-Holland portrait, is particularly interesting because it is decorated with Cook’s own seal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is known of its provenance, but it appears to have been a donation in the early 20th century and has hung in a succession of Whitehall offices for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dangerous-work-at-low-tide"&gt;Dangerous Work at Low Tide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eric-ravilious"&gt;Eric Ravilious&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dangerous Work at Low Tide " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4826/ravilious_749x611.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work of Eric Ravilious is represented by a single work in the collection- but one often considered to be among the very best of his wartime output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 1940 Ravilious visited the Kent coast where he encountered the subject of this painting. One of the few war paintings where human activity is central to the picture, it shows a mini-expedition to defuse a German magnetic mine on the oyster beds at Whitstable, only the second to be washed up on English shores. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this exploit, two naval officers, Commander Obbard and Lieutenant West, were each awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). The picture was shown at the first War Artist exhibition, under the title of ‘Rendering Mines Safe’, later officially changed to ‘Dangerous Work at Low Tide’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Ravilious was among the most foremost of English artists to emerge between the wars. His body of work was wide ranging and multi-faceted: murals, watercolours, wood engravings, painting, lithographs to ceramic design. His illustrations and designs for Wedgewood still influence a generation of designers today. Ravilious was commissioned as a war artist at the end of 1939. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assigned to the Admiralty along with John Nash, they were both appointed Captain, Royal Marines. Although he produced an extraordinary body of work he was unable to fulfil this great promise due to his tragic death while on service as an Official War Artist in 1942, aged 39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fort-southwick-1871"&gt;Fort Southwick, 1871&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the collection of architectural drawings are designs for churches and barracks, as well as Robert Adam’s Admiralty screen and other Whitehall-based drawings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defences at Fort Southwick were thought to be extremely advanced in design, allowing for ease of access to fortification points as well as living quarters which could be easily supplied and cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="french-boulle-bracket-clock"&gt;French Boulle bracket clock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="unknown-artist-1"&gt;Unknown Artist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="French Boulle bracket clock" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4828/boulle_424x529.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt;’s horological collection is extremely important. It falls into two main parts: the maritime clocks and chronometers with many having specialised functions, and the longcase and bracket clocks. They are in many offices, residencies and meeting rooms and several have been in roughly the same place for a nearly a 100 years or longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the specialised marine regulators, chronometers and clocks are on long term loan to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and to various other public collections where access to the general public and to the specialised researcher is easily achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ornate clock was made in France in the later 19th century with decoration invented by Charles Andre Boulle. The preparation of a Boulle case was extremely demanding; patterns of enamel and brass were applied to curved surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clock is decorated in red lacquered enamel and gold markings. Surmounted by a gold ornament it has a brass dial with black hands and Roman numerals on white background, enclosed with a glass hinged bezel with a brass surround and a small square hole at the base of the front showing sun dial pendulum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some years this clock has been displayed in the office of the Chief of Defence Staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavern clocks were so called because of their easily legible dials. In the late 1790s the government, anxious to increase revenue, levied a tax on the ownership of clocks. In order to alleviate the unpopularity of the tax, certain clocks were nominated for public access.  This example, the Admiralty’s clock, hung in Whitehall for public consultation and remains there today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clock has a large black circular dial with gilt hands and gilt Roman numerals/seconds. The dial is enclosed by a glass hinged bezel with wooden surround and an ebonised/ lacquered oak case with door to the front, for access to the interior. Heavily detailed decorative patterns and floral lozenges above and below a coat of arms. There are also small pocket doors to each side of the dial and is weight driven with an 8 day movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, since the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection exists to preserve its current items rather than to spend scarce cash on acquiring new ones, contemporary peacekeeping activities of the Armed Forces are not well represented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that in future years the collection might expand to include more images of early 21st century operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Painted during the Cold War, Global Power is a dramatic painting which depicts a fleet of B-47 jet bombers flying high above the American continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This painting was presented to the Royal Air Force by the United States Air Force. Fausett died in December 1998 at the Mountain View Centre in Rutland, Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Portland stone cenotaph was erected in 1926 on Horse Guards Parade and dedicated to the 5 Foot Guards regiments of World War 1. The bronze figures were cast from guns from the Great War. This small watercolour is one of a set of 6 within the Collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant paintings of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection are those commissioned by the Admiralty from the artists accompanying the voyages of exploration of Cook and Flinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best of these - mainly the works of the artist William Hodges, showing the discoveries of Cook’s second voyage - are on loan to the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the survivors of Cook’s team returned from their third voyage of exploration, Cook himself having been killed in a skirmish in Hawaii, they were famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictures and descriptions of strange and exotic lands, people and animals gave rise to a thriving business in the sale of engravings. This painting and others in the series were exhibited by Webber in the Royal Academy Exhibition over several years. As part of the commission the original paintings reverted to Admiralty ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view is of two huts, the large one containing stores, and an open air trestle with objects.  A century later one of the most powerful volcanic explosions in the history of the world occured at Krakatoa, a volcanic island located between Java and Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1883 there was a series of eruptions from May until 27 August 1883, when an explosion blew the island apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 1944, the War Artists Advisory Committee sent many of its artists to France, to witness and record the D-Day and the Normandy invasion first hand. After painting images of the preparation for invasion in Allied bases in England, Thomas Hennell arrived in Normandy on 16 June, just as the Allied breakout from the coast began. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calais, the scene of so much bombardment, was especially badly damaged. Hennell was particularly affected by the desolation of the area surrounding the church, while the Phare - the lighthouse, on the left of the picture, remained standing in spite of substantial damage from continued shelling. Hennell said “…there is a real splendour about fresh battlefields which quickly fades.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakout lasted well into August with vicious and desperate fighting leaving devastation across the French summer countryside. Following the Allies, sometimes only a few miles behind the front line, Hennell recorded the aftermath of the towns caught in the wake of destruction. He painted images such as the captured V-bomb launch sites, German coastal defences, Pegasus Bridge and several scenes around Nijmegen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Burma Hennell painted scenes of the liberated British soldiers and their prison camps. At the end of the war he stayed on with friends in Indonesia where he was caught up in the Indonesian uprising against the Dutch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 1945 Thomas Hennell was officially reported missing. There were reports that he was mistaken for Dutch and held hostage before being killed by hostile Indonesians in the jungle but nothing was substantiated. In death, as in life, this artist remained enigmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="longcase-clock"&gt;Longcase Clock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="thomas-tompion"&gt;Thomas Tompion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Longcase clock" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4834/tompion_600x800.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-maritime horological collection includes many masterpieces including this Tompion regulator presented to Queen Anne during her appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1708. It is a longcase regulator with a 24 hour graduated chapter ring, counter balance minute hand and a silvered dial with black hands and Roman numerals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a moulded mahogany case with panelled plinth and arched trunk door, the hood with canted corners and brass ball finials and with a presentation inscription: ‘Presented to Queen Anne’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Tompion (1639 to 1716), who worked in London’s Fleet Street, was one of the greatest clock and watchmaker’s whose attention to detail was legendary. His work represents the supremacy of English horology in the 18th century. His achievements include making the first clocks for the Greenwich Observatory in 1676.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technical clock is displayed in the Historic Dockyard at Portsmouth. It was made in London during the 1820s by the clockmaker E Dent. Regulators are extremely accurate clocks and designed as the standard by which other timepieces are set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most regulators, including this example, are weight-driven and have a deadbeat anchor escapement which maintains power. This particular model is known as the ‘Portsmouth Standard’ and was originally connected by a wire to the Portsmouth post office and then to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1843, public acclamation of Nelson as hero was at its height. A public subscription was set up and the sculptor Edward Hodges Baily was commissioned to produce a statue of the Admiral, to be placed in a square named after his most famous battle. The result was the production of Nelson’s Column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sculptor gave his model - also known as a maquette - to the Admiralty. It now stands on the foyer of the former Old Admiralty Building, Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection includes many paintings showing battle scenes, particularly naval battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle scenes were potentially lucrative for artists, particularly in the late 18th and 19th centuries as engravings found a ready and apparently unquenchable market. The paintings themselves were avidly commissioned and collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladysmith was subjected to a 4-month siege during the second Boer War and was relieved in February 1900 by Lord Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At anchor off Capetown were two British cruisers, HMS Powerful and HMS Terrible. General Sir George White VC, the British Commander in Natal, signalled the cruisers for assistance, particularly with their long-range guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for General White, Captain P Scott RN of the Terrible was a gunnery expert and he quickly designed a carriage that could hold the 6-inch , 4.7 inch and 12 pounder naval guns in transit and into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carriages were then speedily manufactured at the Durban Railway workshops. The contingent was soon ready: 280 officers and men with two 4.7 inch guns, 4 long range 12 pounder’s and 4 maxim guns (early machine guns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Naval Brigade, as they were now called, went by rail from Durban to Ladysmith with all their guns, ammunition, provisions and equipment. Their train was the last to complete the journey to Ladysmith on 30 October just as the bombardment started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Naval Brigade were soon in action against the Boer artillery and their long range guns were very effective in countering the enemy batteries and holding them at bay throughout the siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, since the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection exists to preserve its current items rather than to spend scarce cash on acquiring new ones, contemporary peacekeeping activities of the Armed Forces are not well represented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aerial reconnaissance is shown here in Pamela Drew’s ‘RAF Venoms over Arabia’. It gives a strong sense of the geographical hostility of some of the environments in which our Armed Forces work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary role of the Venom was that of a short range, single seat fighter/bomber. With its 20mm cannons in the nose and provision for bombs or rocket projectiles the Venom could be used effectively in either the fighter or the bomber role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the 31 October 1956 Venoms were used in action during the Suez operations to attack Egyptian airfields. They saw action once again in the summer of 1957 when Nos 249 and 8 Squadrons, based at Khormaksar in Aden, were used against Omani rebels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other operators of land based fighter bomber Venoms included New Zealand, Iraq, Venezuela and Switzerland. The last Venoms in service were finally retired in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This extraordinary item, which takes the form of a mythical sea-creature surrounded by very detailed crustacea, was among the collection of items commissioned by Mrs Fish for the Admiralty in order to commemorate the death of Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Fish’ collection included many extraordinary pieces of furniture, all distinguished by their inclusion into the design of mythical sea creatures and was in use in Admiralty House, Whitehall for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-departure-of-henry-viii-from-calais-25-july-1544"&gt;The Departure of Henry VIII from Calais, 25 July 1544&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="engraved-by-james-basire-after-a-painting-by-s-grimm"&gt;Engraved by James Basire after a painting by S Grimm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Departure of Henry VIII from Calais, 25 July 1544" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4841/henry1_607x330.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many engravings in the collection are finished by the application of watercolours; all the 18th and 19th century examples, both coloured and monochrome, are extremely sensitive to light and must be displayed in carefully-controlled locations under special UV-resistant light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This engraving was made by James Basire (1730 to 1802) from a drawing by S H Grimm, which in turn was taken from an original coeval painting. It was published according to Act of Parliament on 5 July 1781.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Anglo-French peace of 1514 plans were laid for a meeting between the English and French kings as the final act of reconciliation between the two realms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plans were delayed with the deterioration of relations after the accession of Francis I in 1515. However, the Treaty of London in 1518 decreed that Henry VIII would confer with the new King of France at a meeting in the early summer of 1520. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This immensely lavish meeting was due to take place on the French/Calais border at the Field of Cloth of Gold, the focus of which was a series of tournaments designed to end the prolonged hostility between England and France. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This engraving actually depicts Henry VIII’s embarkation at Dover with his troops, his retinue comprised over 4,500 men and Queen Catherine (of Aragon) took a similar number, including her ladies of the bed chamber. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three thousand horses were shipped over not merely for transportation purposes but also for use in the chivalrous entertainment that was to follow the historic meeting. The two kings finally met on Corpus Christi day - 2 June 1520. Trumpets sounded, the monarchs embraced, and 3 weeks of festivity, gluttony and hypocrisy began. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a few weeks later, after all the staggeringly expensive splendour had faded, Henry VIII made a secret agreement with Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, not to ally with King Francis. England was once more at loggerheads with France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chilling image shows British troops in Bosnia.  They form part of a set of 3 Howson works in the possession of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection, and currently hang in a senior Whitehall office. Peter Howson was commissioned in spring 1993 by the Imperial War Museum and Times Newspapers to go to Bosnia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made two visits to the country in June and December, travelling with the British forces participating in the United Nations Protection Force. In June he went to Travnik, Gornji Vakuf, Prozor and Vitez, but was forced to return early because of illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he returned to Bosnia in December 1993 he was accompanied by his friend Ian MacColl who made a video diary of their experiences. In addition to the places he had seen in June, he went to Zenica and observed the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second half of the eighteenth century the tradition arose that an engraver producing an image of an Admiralty subject would present one of the first finished engravings to the First Lord. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ‘first impressions are of extremely fine quality since the engraved lines on the copperplate, from which the engraving was pressed, were sharp. With each subsequent pressing the lines would become gradually less distinct and the value of the finished engraving subsequently lower. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheerness is a commercial port and main town of the Isle of Sheppey and owes much to its origins as a Royal Naval dockyard town. John Rennie was the 19th century engineer who surveyed and designed a new dockyard for Sheerness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work commenced in December 1813 and the Duke of Clarence who later became King William IV formally opened the completed dockyard on 5 September 1823. It served the Navy until 1960.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection includes several 100 portraits of varying finesse and interest. All, even those of a lesser artistic technique and political sophistication are cherished and hung in locations appropriate to their subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Inman was associated with the Matthew Flinder’s expedition of 1801. Born in 1776 in Yorkshire, he was appointed to the position of astronomer on the ‘Investigator’ voyage. In 1808 the Admiralty established the Royal Naval College at Greenwich where Inman took up the post of Professor of Mathematics and Naval Architecture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later he moved to the Naval Academy at Portsmouth where he produced possibly the most famous textbook of the Royal Navy: ‘Navigation and Nautical Astronomy for the use of British Seaman’ in 1821.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accompanying tables - ‘Inman’s Nautical Tables’ - underpinned the standard system in the Royal Navy and in many other navies for many years, well into the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir James Grigg was Secretary of State for war in the Coalition Administration during World War 2. A civil servant who became a minister of Cabinet rank, he also later became a city magnate. Percy James Grigg or ‘PJ’ as he was widely known among his friends, was a brilliant administrator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This painting is set in one of the principal offices of state in the old War Office where Grigg operated at the height of his powers. This portrait is also significant not only for the fact that it is the only one in existence of a War Office civil servant, but also that it is painted by Eric Kennington - a war artist who usually painted military portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant paintings of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection are those commissioned by the Admiralty from the artists accompanying the voyages of exploration of Cook and Flinders. The best of these are on loan to the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hodges’s paintings of the Pacific celebrate British exploration. He was appointed by the Admiralty to record the places discovered on Cook’s second voyage, undertaken in the ‘Resolution’ and ‘Adventure’, 1772 to 1775. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cook’s main purpose on this expedition was to locate, if possible, the much talked-of but unknown Southern Continent and further expand knowledge of the central Pacific islands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This huge painting is Hodges’ largest from the voyage and illustrates ‘one of the most magnificent sights in the South Sea’. Hodges depicts three war canoes, part of the Tahitian fleet preparing for a punitive expedition against the neighbouring island of Moorea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hodges’ records of coastal profiles were in part important for navigational reasons. This was primarily in the form of drawings, many later converted to engravings in the official account of the voyage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also did oil paintings on the voyage but most, especially these larger ones, were painted in London on his return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This painting was part of a large restoration project undertaken on 8 extraordinary bird paintings that hang in Amport House. The work was carried out by the conservation studio of Alexandra Walker whose painstaking work uncovered the signature of Tobias Stranover on 3 of the paintings. In each case, several layers of late 19th century varnish were removed and consolidation work undertaken to the painted surface beneath. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of the paintings were relined before being placed on new stretchers. The finished paintings are now stable and will need no further restoration for many years. They have been returned to Amport House in Andover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1801, at the age of 19, landscape artist William Westall found himself aboard the Investigator, the ship that Matthew Flinders was to command on his voyage of discovery to Terra Australis.  Along with a team of artists and botanists, he produced a splendid visual record of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flinders’ voyage was intended to capitalise on Cook’s discoveries some years earlier; in particular, Flinders was anxious to discover if Australia was bisected by a navigable waterway, which would have huge benefits for trade routes. This voyage, however, was not as successful as Cook’s and ended in shipwreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his return to England Westall produced 9 landscapes. He worked on them for 3 years completing the last in 1812.  Westall shows scenes emphasising the strangeness of the explorers’ discoveries, as can be seen from this painting, which hangs in Admiralty House, Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westall did not fullfil his early promise becoming mainly a book illustrator. He died in 1850 aged 68 while working on a painting of the shipwreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the collection of architectural drawings are designs for churches and barracks as well as Robert Adam’s Admiralty screen and other Whitehall-based drawings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augustus Charles Pugin, a refugee from the French Revolution, was a gifted draughtsman who produced 2 illustrated works on Gothic architecture, which greatly influenced his son (Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin) - the driving force behind the design and ornamentation of the Palace of Westminster.  In this sketch the elder Pugin displays an architect’s view of the street and currently on loan to the office of the Adjutant General.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wonderful work shows the destruction suffered after the fall of France. Hennell was much affected by the courage of the French in their efforts to rebuild their infrastructure and this watercolour is is a powerful evocation of the French spirit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recently liberated townspeople, in spite of the ruined infrastructure of their city, are already flying the flags of liberation and working to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the war Hennell stayed with friends in Indonesia, where he was caught up in the Indonesian uprising against the Dutch. In November 1945 Thomas Hennell was officially reported missing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were reports that he was mistaken for Dutch and held hostage before being killed by hostile Indonesians in the jungle but nothing was substantiated. In death, as in life, this artist remained enigmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paintings themselves were avidly commissioned and collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This naval battle, which has attracted a huge amount of academic interest in recent years, established the strategic control of the North Sea by the British fleet and is believed to be one of the first aerial views of a battle. The work is accompanied by a sketch and it hangs in the Joint Services Command and Staff College.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the circumstances surrounding the origins of this painting. It was probably made for a private commission to show all the ships commanded by a particular captain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not appear to depict any particular naval event. The painting is signed and dated and came into the ownership of the Admiralty from the collection of Sir Phillip Stevens, Admiralty Secretary from 1763 to 1795. It hangs in the Admiralty Board Room, just off Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This huge group portrait - the figures are a little over life size - shows the gentlemen standing around the throne in St James’ Palace. Each officer appointed to this role (an honorary one) had served either in the Crimean War or in the Indian Mutiny. The artist presented the portrait to the War Office in 1902 where it hung for many years outside the office of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. It now hangs in a military establishment in Wiltshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w-l-wyllie"&gt;W L Wyllie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The German High Sea Fleet, Caged in Scapa Flow, 1919" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4854/wyllie_1000x435.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War 1, Sir Arthur Balfour, the First Lord of the Admiralty, gave permission for Wyllie to cruise in Royal Navy ships. In the North Sea, Harwich, Rosyth, Cromarty, and Scapa Flow, he made hundreds of studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyllie witnessed the German fleet surrender in the Forth and went with the last convoy of battleships to Scapa Flow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as this large oil painting, a number of etchings and drypoints resulted from all these cruises. Although not an official war artist during World War I, Wyllie had access to many naval bases and contributed to two books. They were the ‘Sea Fights of the Great War: Naval incidents during the first nine months’, 1918 and 1919. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the mid-1870s Wyllie travelled the length and breadth of the Thames and Medway on a barge, converted into a floating studio, filling sketch books and painting evocative scenes of the naval and merchant shipping. He was elected ARA in 1889, following an exhibition of watercolours at the Fine Art Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyllie’s output was prolific, covering all kinds of maritime subjects but with a great interest in the Royal Navy and historic occasions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, Trafalgar caught his imagination and shortly before his death he began work on a huge panoramic painting of the Battle of Trafalgar. The painting took 13 months to paint and was unveiled by King George V in 1930 in what is now the Royal Naval Museum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyllie painted almost to the day he died and is buried in Portchester Castle overlooking the Solent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-grand-fleet-1916"&gt;The Grand Fleet, 1916&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="muirhead-bone-1"&gt;Muirhead Bone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Grand Fleet, 1916" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4855/bone1_800x402.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muirhead Bone was a master etcher, draughtsman and war artist who was born in Glasgow. He became the first official war artist in 1916 when he was attached to the intelligence branch of the War Office and sent to France.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working at considerable speed his sketches covered a wide range of subjects, mostly behind the lines, including the work of the medical services, the repair and maintenance of big guns and off duty war weary soldiers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He worked in various media - chalk, charcoal, pencil and pen - sometimes adding touches of watercolour later. Subsequently, Bone illustrated a 2 volume set of books entitled ‘The Western Front’ which was published in 1917. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muirhead Bone also served as an official war artist in the World War 2, by which time he was Sir Muirhead, having been knighted by George VI in 1937. Bone was attached to the Admiralty and was not only the first but also the most senior of its artists. His work was to become the most widely reproduced official war art of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panoramic view of the Firth of Forth shows no human figures as Bone was more concerned with the positioning of the ships.The fleet rests quietly, preparing as best it can for the unknown.  The fleet was based in Scapa Flow, a land-locked area of water in the middle of the Orkney Islands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The channel between Scapa and the Scottish mainland is the Pentland Firth. While waiting for the German high seas fleet to ‘come out’, divisions of battleships would go to sea in turn to do ‘battle-practice firings’ at a target towed – at a very respectful distance – by a tug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="trafalgar"&gt;Trafalgar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 was the deciding event in the Napoleonic naval wars and probably the most depicted battle in British history. The &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection includes 3 significant versions and this one is probably the best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painting is accompanied by the artists’ sketch, which suggests that he was present at the battle itself, although we have been unable to confirm this. The work was commissioned by a contemporary naval captain and bequeathed to the Admiralty in 1926.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chilling image shows British troops in Bosnia. They form part of a set of three Peter Howson works in the possession of the &lt;abbr title="Ministry of Defence"&gt;MOD&lt;/abbr&gt; art collection and currently hang in a senior Whitehall office. Howson was commissioned in spring 1993 by the Imperial War Museum and Times Newspapers to go to Bosnia. He made two visits to the country in June and December, travelling with the British forces participating in the United Nations Protection Force. In June he went to Travnik, Gornji Vakuf, Prozor and Vitez but was forced to return early because of illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he returned to Bosnia in December 1993 he was accompanied by his friend Ian MacColl who made a video diary of their experiences. In addition to the places he had seen in June, he went to Zenica and observed the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the better known World War 2 artists were a small London-based group commissioned to record the effect of bomb damage on well-known buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These artists, employed by the Ministry of Works, were given special access to damaged government buildings - but they were hampered by a lack of canvas on which to paint. William Hampton solved the problem by producing paintings such as this one on utility hardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the wartime period a small team of artist-restorers, working for the Artists’ Section of the Ministry of Works, were responsible for the care and maintenance of public works of art. This team built on a long tradition of employing artists in a dual role as painting conservators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the London Blitz, some of these artists were asked to record damage to significant buildings such as the Tower of London and HM Custom House. The official war artists commissioned by the War Artists Advisory Committee were all, at this point, deployed out of London, and among the few people available and capable of undertaking the task were Alistair Stewart and William Hampton.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Christmas joy for old soldier who finally got his medal</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army veteran Joe McKenna, 72, who volunteers at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lancashireinfantrymuseum.org.uk/" title="Duke of Lancaster's Regiment Lancashire Infantry Museum"&gt;Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment Lancashire Infantry Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Preston, left the military in 1970 just months before his Northern Ireland service medal was minted and eventually decided to track down his medal after years of attending parades where he was the only veteran not wearing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Major Bob Dixon, from 2 Medical Regiment and a fellow volunteer at the museum, offered to help Joe claim his honour. Sergeant Major Dixon said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I had been helping some visitors at the museum with enquiries about their service medals and so I offered to help Joe too. I got all the paperwork together, went around to his house, and we filled in the documents before sending them off to the MOD Medal Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We got a reply within 2 months, the quickest I’ve ever known; I think the turnaround was so fast because he still lives at the same address that appeared on his service papers back in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe enlisted in the Loyal Regiment, a forebear to the North West’s current infantry regiment &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/3477.aspx" title="The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment"&gt;The Duke of Lancaster’s&lt;/a&gt;, almost exactly 51 years ago and served in Kenya, Swaziland, Cyprus and Malta as well as in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Northern Ireland service medal" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5711/Joe_smedal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Joe McKenna's Northern Ireland service medal [Picture: Sergeant Mark Garry, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he left the Army as a Lance Corporal in 1970, Joe worked for more than 30 years as an &lt;abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt; driver, married Josie, with whom he had his children Sandra and Peter, and is now a grandfather of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe said until recently the distractions of day-to-day life meant he just never got around to claiming what was his: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was only when I was marching at the Armed Forces Day parade in Preston last summer when I thought ‘I’m getting on a bit now and I should really get my medal’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think my son would like to have it when I’m gone; he and my daughter think that it is marvellous that it’s finally here. It’s the best Christmas present ever and it makes me very proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe’s wife Josie added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It really was something special to see his face when he received the medal; it was as if all his Christmases had come at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe now plans to wear his medal at his regiment’s Kimberley Day service and parade in February 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
