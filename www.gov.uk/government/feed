    <title>Changes to the driving licence and categories</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 19 January 2013 the European Union Third Directive on driving licences comes into force. All new driving licences from this date will have to meet the terms of the Directive. The changes will mainly affect motorcyclists, lorry, bus and minibus drivers and those who tow trailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="your-licence-explained"&gt;Your licence explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="changes-to-the-front-of-the-licence"&gt;Changes to the front of the licence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following changes will apply to the front of new driving licences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all dates will be shown as DD.MM.YYYY&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;categories shown will be separated by a slash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the date in 4b will show the licence expiry date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="changes-to-the-back-of-the-licence"&gt;Changes to the back of the licence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the 15 October 2012 to 18 January 2013, you’ll be issued with either photocard licence example A or example B. From 19 January 2013 you’ll be issued a photocard licence showing example B only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="New driving licence photocard licence Example A" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1154/Card_01_960x640_01.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example A - issued from 15 October 2012 to 18 January 2013

1 - New design showing full table of categories, pictograms, start and expiry dates and any codes that apply
2 - Legend containing explanation of each field's contents
3 - Overflow of information/restriction codes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="New driving licence photocard licence Example B" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1155/Card_02_960x640_02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example B - issued from 15 October 2012 to 18 January 2013

1 - New design showing full table of categories, pictograms, start and expiry dates and any codes that apply
2 - Legend containing explanation of each field's contents
3 - Overflow of information/restriction codes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expiry date of your licence will be shown on the front in section 4b and the expiry date of your entitlements will be shown on the back of your licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new style licence will look different to the current licence. All vehicle categories will be listed on the back of your licence with dates against those you are entitled to drive or ride. You won’t be entitled to drive any category of vehicle that has lines instead of dates. However, if you have passed a test in a larger vehicle you may still be entitled to drive or ride smaller vehicles of that type which have lines shown instead of dates, eg holders of full category A would be entitled to ride a category A2 vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="licence-counterpart"&gt;Licence counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your photocard licence is accompanied by a paper counterpart. The counterpart will contain your provisional driving entitlements, driving offences and other relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="lorry-bus-and-minibus-licence-holders"&gt;Lorry, bus and minibus licence holders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you apply to claim your first lorry or bus test pass or renew your driving licence on or after 19 January 2013, the licence issued will be valid for a maximum of 5 years. This affects you if you have passed driving tests for categories C1, C, D1, D, C1E, CE, D1E or DE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve been issued with a 5 year licence you’ll need to renew the licence when it expires - the licence expiry date is shown in 4b. To renew the licence and to renew your lorry and/or bus entitlement you’ll need to fill in the application and medical questions on an ‘Application for a lorry, bus or minibus driving licence’ (D2) or the renewal reminder form which we send you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already passed a driving test in one of the above categories, the new rules will apply when you next renew your driving licence or when you renew your lorry and/or bus entitlement, whichever is earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="your-categories-explained"&gt;Your categories explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mopeds-am-and-q"&gt;Mopeds (AM and q)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All licences issued on or after 19 January 2013 will show moped categories as AM and q in place of category p. But if you held full category p before this date you’ll keep this entitlement and it will be shown on your licence together with new categories AM and q. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="motorcycles-a1-a2-and-a"&gt;Motorcycles (A1, A2 and A)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different minimum age restrictions and power outputs for the different categories. If you are an existing tricycle rider you won’t lose the entitlement you currently hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests for mopeds with 3 or 4 wheels, A1 and A tricycles and sidecar combinations will only be offered to physically disabled drivers or riders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tricycles-am-a-and-a1"&gt;Tricycles (AM, A and A1)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are varied minimum age restrictions and power outputs for the different categories. If you are an existing tricycle rider you won’t lose the entitlement you currently hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests for mopeds with 3 or 4 wheels, A1 and A tricycles and sidecar combinations will only be offered to physically disabled drivers or riders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="drivers-who-tow-trailers"&gt;Drivers who tow trailers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve passed your car (category B) test on or after 19 January 2013 and you want to tow a trailer weighing more than 3,500 kilograms with a car or small vehicle (category B and B+E), then you’ll need to pass a test for category C1E. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got your driving entitlement before 19 January 2013 you will retain it. There are no further changes to rules on towing trailers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further information on towing trailers please see booklet &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/forms/~/media/pdf/leaflets/INF30.ashx"&gt;Requirements for towing trailers in Great Britain (INF30)&lt;/a&gt;(PDF 488kB).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jury vetting: right of stand by guidelines</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-exercise-by-the-crown-of-its-right-of-stand-by-update-2012"&gt;The exercise by the Crown of its right of stand by (update 2012)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1988 the defence right to challenge jurors without cause was abolished, the prosecution right to do so was, however, retained.  This means that the prosecution can object to a potential juror without giving any reason. It is recognised that this is an exceptional power and so the Attorney General, therefore, issues guidance to prosecutors on its use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the use of the right of stand by is limited to those cases which involve National Security or Terrorism. The Guidelines outline the circumstances in which it is appropriate for the prosecution to exercise this power and the procedure which is to be followed. The Guidelines make clear that the authority to use this power is limited to the Attorney General. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of the Guidelines included an annex prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on the conduct of inquiries into a juror’s previous convictions. This is now done automatically by Her Majesty’s Courts Service and therefore the ACPO guidance is no longer relevant and, in consequence, is not included in these 2012 Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="guidelines"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attorney General has issued the following guidelines on the exercise by the Crown in England and Wales of its right to stand by. The guidelines update the previous guidelines issued in 1989 to coincide with the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 s.118, which abolished the right of peremptory challenge. These updated guidelines are to have effect from the 27th November 2012. The Attorney General has also issued amended guidelines on jury checks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Although the law has long recognised the right of the Crown to exclude a member of a jury panel from sitting as a juror by the exercise in open court of the right to request a stand by or, if necessary, by challenge for cause, it has been customary for those instructed to prosecute on behalf of the Crown to assert that right only sparingly and in exceptional circumstances. It is generally accepted that the prosecution should not use its right in order to influence the overall composition of a jury or with a view to tactical advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.The approach outlined above is founded on the principles that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. the members of a jury should be selected at random from the panel subject to any rule of law as to right of challenge by the defence, and  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. the Juries Act 1974 identifies those classes of persons who alone are disqualified from or ineligible for service on a jury. No other class of person may be treated as disqualified or ineligible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.The enactment by Parliament of s.118 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 abolishing the right of defendants to remove jurors by means of peremptory challenge makes it appropriate that the Crown should assert its right to stand by only on the basis of clearly defined and restrictive criteria. Derogation from the principle that members of a jury should be selected at random should be permitted only where it is essential.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Primary responsibility for ensuring that an individual does not serve on a jury if he is not competent to discharge properly the duties of a juror rests with the appropriate court officer and, ultimately the trial judge. Current legislation provides, in ss.9 to s.10 of the Juries Act 1974, fairly wide discretion to excuse, defer or discharge jurors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.The circumstances in which it would be proper for the Crown to exercise its right to stand by a member of a jury panel are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. where a jury check authorised in accordance with the Attorney General’s Guidelines on Jury Checks reveals information justifying exercise of the right to stand by in accordance with para.11 of the guidelines below and the Attorney General personally authorises the exercise of the right to stand by; or  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. where a person is about to be sworn as a juror who is manifestly unsuitable and the defence agree that, accordingly, the exercise by the prosecution of the right to stand by would be appropriate. An example of the sort of exceptional circumstances which might justify stand by is where it becomes apparent that, despite the provisions mentioned in para.4 above, a juror selected for service to try a complex case is in fact illiterate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="jury-checks"&gt;Jury checks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.The principles which are generally to be observed are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. that members of a jury should be selected at random from the panel,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. the Juries Act 1974 identifies those classes of persons who alone are either disqualified from or ineligible for service on a jury; no other class of person may be treated as disqualified or ineligible,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. the correct way for the Crown to seek to exclude a member of the panel from sitting as a juror is by the exercise in open court of the right to request a stand by or, if necessary, to challenge for cause.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Parliament has provided safeguards against jurors who may be corrupt or biased. In addition to the provision for majority verdicts, there is the sanction of a criminal offence for a disqualified person to serve on a jury. The omission of a disqualified person from the panel is a matter for court officials - they will check criminal records for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a potential juror is a disqualified person.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.There are, however, certain exceptional types of case of public importance for which the provisions as to majority verdicts and the disqualification of jurors may not be sufficient to ensure the proper administration of justice. In such cases it is in the interests of both justice and the public that there should be further safeguards against the possibility of bias and in such cases checks which go beyond the investigation of criminal records may be necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.These classes of case my be defined broadly as (a) cases in which national security is involved and part of the evidence is likely to be heard in camera, and (b) security and terrorist cases in which a juror’s extreme beliefs could prevent a fair trial.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.The particular aspects of these cases which may make it desirable to seek extra precautions are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. in security cases a danger that a juror, either voluntarily or under pressure, may make an improper use of evidence which, because of its sensitivity, has been given in camera,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. in both security and terrorist cases the danger that a juror’s personal beliefs are so biased as to go beyond normally reflecting the broad spectrum of views and interests in the community to reflect the extreme views of sectarian interest or pressure group to a degree which might interfere with his fair assessment of the facts of the case or lead him to exert improper pressure on his fellow jurors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.In order to ascertain whether in exceptional circumstances of the above nature either of these factors might seriously influence a potential juror’s impartial performance of his duties or his respecting the secrecy of evidence given in camera, it may be necessary to conduct a limited investigation of the panel. In general, such further investigation beyond one of criminal records made for disqualifications may only be made with the records of the police. However, a check may, additionally be made against the records of the Security Service. No checks other than on these sources and no general inquiries are to be made save to the limited extent that they may be needed to confirm the identity of a juror about whom the initial check has raised serious doubts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.No further investigation, as described in para.6 above, should be made save with the personal authority of the Attorney General on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions and such checks are hereafter referred to as “authorised checks”. When a chief officer of police or the prosecutor has reason to believe that it is likely that an authorised check may be desirable and proper in accordance with these guidelines, he should refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In those cases in which the Director of Public Prosecutions believes authorised checks are both proportionate and necessary, the Director will make an application to the Attorney General. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.The Director of Public Prosecutions will provide the Attorney General with all relevant information in support of the requested authorised checks.  The Attorney General will consider personally the request and, if appropriate, authorise the check. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.The result of any authorised check will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Director will then decide, having regard to the matters set out in para.5 above, what information ought to be brought to the attention of prosecuting counsel.  The Director will also provide the Attorney General with the result of the authorised check.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.Although the right of stand by and the decision to authorise checks are wholly within the discretion of the Attorney General, when the Attorney General has agreed to an authorised check being conducted, the Director of Public Prosecutions will write to the Presiding Judge for the area to advise him that this is being done.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11.No right of stand by should be exercised by counsel for the Crown on the basis of information obtained as a result of an authorised check save with the personal authority of the Attorney General and unless the information is such as, having regard to the facts of the case and the offences charged, to afford strong reason for believing that a particular juror might be a security risk, be susceptible to improper approaches or be influenced in arriving at a verdict for the reasons given above.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.Information revealed in the course of an authorised check must be considered in line with the normal rules on disclosure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13.A record is to be kept by the Director of Public Prosecutions of the use made by counsel of the information passed to him and of the jurors stood by or challenged by the parties to the proceedings. A copy of this record is to be forwarded to the Attorney General for the sole purpose of enabling him to monitor the operation of these guidelines.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14.No use of the information obtained as a result of an authorised check is to be made except as may be necessary in direct relation to or arising out of the trial for which the check was authorised.  The information may, however, be used for the prevention of crime or as evidence in a future criminal prosecution, save that material obtained from the Security Service may only be used in those circumstances with the authority of the Security Service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The acceptance of pleas and the prosecutor's role in the sentencing exercise</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-foreword"&gt;A: Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A1. Prosecutors have an important role in protecting the victim’s interests in the criminal justice process, not least in the acceptance of pleas and the sentencing exercise. The basis of plea, particularly in a case that is not contested, is the vehicle through which the victim’s voice is heard. Factual inaccuracies in pleas in mitigation cause distress and offence to victims, the families of victims and witnesses. This can take many forms but may be most acutely felt when the victim is dead and the family hears inaccurate assertions about the victim’s character or lifestyle. Prosecution advocates are reminded that they are required to adhere to the standards set out in the Victim’s Charter, which places the needs of the victim at the heart of the criminal justice process, and that they are subject to a similar obligation in respect of the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A2. The principle of fairness is central to the administration of justice. The implementation of Human Rights Act 1998 in October 2000 incorporated into domestic law the principle of fairness to the accused articulated in the European Convention on Human Rights. Accuracy and reasonableness of plea plays an important part in ensuring fairness both to the accused and to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A3. The Attorney General’s guidelines on the acceptance of pleas issued on December 7, 2000 highlighted the importance of transparency in the conduct of justice. The basis of plea agreed by the parties in a criminal trial is central to the sentencing process. An illogical or unsupported basis of plea can lead to an unduly lenient sentence being passed, and has a consequential effect where consideration arises as to whether to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A4. These guidelines, which replace the guidelines issued in October 2005, give guidance on how prosecutors should meet these objectives of protection of victims’ interests and of securing fairness and transparency in the process. They take into account paragraphs IV.45.4 and following of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction, amended May 2009 and the guidance issued by the Court of Appeal (Criminal) Division in R v Beswick [1996] 1 Cr.App.R. 343, R v Tolera [1999] 1 Cr.App.R. 25 and R v Underwood [2005] 1 Cr.App.R 178. They complement the Bar Council guidance on written standards for the conduct of professional work issued with the 7th edition of the code of conduct for the Bar of England and Wales and the Law Society’s professional conduct rules. When considering the acceptance of a guilty plea prosecution advocates are also reminded of the need to apply ‘The Farquharson Guidelines on The Role and Responsibilities of the Prosecution Advocate’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A5. The guidelines should be followed by all prosecutors and those persons designated under section 7 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (designated caseworkers) and apply to prosecutions conducted in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="b-general-principles"&gt;B: General principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B1. Justice in this jurisdiction, save in the most exceptional circumstances, is conducted in public. This includes the acceptance of pleas by the prosecution and sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B2. The Code for Crown Prosecutors governs the prosecutor’s decision-making prior to the commencement of the trial hearing and sets out the circumstances in which pleas to a reduced number of charges, or less serious charges, can be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B3. When a case is listed for trial and the prosecution form the view that the appropriate course is to accept a plea before the proceedings commence or continue, or to offer no evidence on the indictment or any part of it, the prosecution should whenever practicable speak to the victim or the victim’s family, so that the position can be explained. The views of the victim or the family may assist in informing the prosecutor’s decision as to whether it is the public interest, as defined by the Code for Crown Prosecutors, to accept or reject the plea. The victim or victim’s family should then be kept informed and decisions explained once they are made at court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B4. The appropriate disposal of a criminal case after conviction is as much a part of the criminal justice process as the trial of guilt or innocence. The prosecution advocate represents the public interest, and should be ready to assist the court to reach its decision as to the appropriate sentence. This will include drawing the court’s attention to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any victim personal statement or other information available to the prosecution advocate as to the impact of the offence on the victim &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;where appropriate, to any evidence of the impact of the offending on a community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any statutory provisions relevant to the offender and the offences under consideration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any relevant sentencing guidelines and guideline cases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the aggravating and mitigating factors of the offence under consideration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;B5. The prosecution advocate may also offer assistance to the court by making submissions, in the light of all these factors, as to the appropriate sentencing range. In all cases, it is the prosecution advocate’s duty to apply for appropriate ancillary orders, such as anti-social behaviour orders and confiscation orders. When considering which ancillary orders to apply for, prosecution advocates must always have regard to the victim’s needs, including the question of his or her future protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c-the-basis-of-plea"&gt;C: The basis of plea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C1. The basis of a guilty plea must not be agreed on a misleading or untrue set of facts and must take proper account of the victim’s interests. An illogical or insupportable basis of plea will inevitably result in the imposition of an inappropriate sentence and is capable of damaging public confidence in the criminal justice system. In cases involving multiple defendants the bases of plea for each defendant must be factually consistent with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C2. When the defendant indicates an acceptable plea, the defence advocate should reduce the basis of the plea to writing. This must be done in all cases save for those in which the defendant has indicated that the guilty plea has been or will be tendered on the basis of the prosecution case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C3. The written basis of plea must be considered with great care, taking account of the position of any other relevant defendant where appropriate. The prosecution should not lend itself to any agreement whereby a case is presented to the sentencing judge on a misleading or untrue set of facts or on a basis that is detrimental to the victim’s interests. There will be cases where a defendant seeks to mitigate on the basis of assertions of fact which are outside the scope of the prosecution’s knowledge. A typical example concerns the defendant’s state of mind. If a defendant wishes to be sentenced on this basis, the prosecution advocate should invite the judge not to accept the defendant’s version unless he or she gives evidence on oath to be tested in cross-examination. Paragraph IV.45.14 of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction states that in such circumstances the defence advocate should be prepared to call the defendant and, if the defendant is not willing to testify, subject to any explanation that may be given, the judge may draw such inferences as appear appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C4. The prosecution advocate should show the prosecuting authority any written record relating to the plea and agree with them the basis on which the case will be opened to the court. If, as may well be the case, the basis of plea differs in its implications for sentencing or the making of ancillary orders from the case originally outlined by the prosecution, the prosecution advocate must ensure that such differences are accurately reflected in the written record prior to showing it to the prosecuting authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C5. It is the responsibility of the prosecution advocate thereafter to ensure that the defence advocate is aware of the basis on which the plea is accepted by the prosecution and the way in which the prosecution case will be opened to the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C6. In all cases where it is likely to assist the court where the sentencing issues are complex or unfamiliar the prosecution must add to the written outline of the case which is served upon the court a summary of the key considerations. This should take the form of very brief notes on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any relevant statutory limitations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the names of any relevant sentencing authorities or guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scope for any ancillary orders (eg concerning anti-social behaviour, confiscation or deportation will need to be considered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the age of the defendant and information regarding any outstanding offences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;C7. It remains open to the prosecutor to provide further written information (for example to supplement and update the analysis at later stages of the case) where he or she thought that likely to assist the court, or if the judge requests it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C8. When the prosecution advocate has agreed the written basis of plea submitted by the defence advocate, he or she should endorse the document accordingly. If the prosecution advocate takes issue with all or part of the written basis of plea, the procedure set out in the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction (and in Part 37.10(5) of the Criminal Procedure Rules) should be followed. The defendant’s basis of plea must be set out in writing identifying what is in dispute; the court may invite the parties to make representations about whether the dispute is material to sentence; and if the court decides that it is a material dispute, the court will invite further representations or evidence as it may require and decide the dispute in accordance with the principles set out in R v Newton, 77 Cr.App.R.13, CA. The signed original document setting out the disputed factual matters should be made available to the trial judge and thereafter lodged with the court papers, as it will form part of the record of the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C9. Where the basis of plea cannot be agreed and the discrepancy between the two accounts is such as to have a potentially significant effect on the level of sentence, it is the duty of the defence advocate so to inform the court before the sentencing process begins. There remains an overriding duty on the prosecution advocate to ensure that the sentencing judge is made aware of the discrepancy and of the consideration which must be given to holding a Newton hearing to resolve the issue. The court should be told where a derogatory reference to a victim, witness or third party is not accepted, even though there may be no effect on sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C10. As emphasised in paragraph IV.45.10 of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction, whenever an agreement as to the basis of plea is made between the prosecution and defence, any such agreement will be subject to the approval of the trial judge, who may of his or her own motion disregard the agreement and direct that a Newton hearing should be held to determine the proper basis on which sentence should be passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C11. Where a defendant declines to admit an offence that he or she previously indicated should be taken into consideration, the prosecution advocate should indicate to the defence advocate and the court that, subject to further review, the offence may now form the basis of a new prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="d-sentence-indications"&gt;D: Sentence indications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D1. Only in the Crown Court may sentence indications be sought. Advocates there are reminded that indications as to sentence should not be sought from the trial judge unless issues between the prosecution and defence have been addressed and resolved. Therefore, in difficult or complicated cases, no less than seven days notice in writing of an intention to seek an indication should normally be given to the prosecution and the court. When deciding whether the circumstances of a case require such notice to be given, defence advocates are reminded that prosecutors should not agree a basis of plea unless and until the necessary consultation has taken place first with the victim and/or the victim’s family and second, in the case of an independent prosecution advocate, with the prosecuting authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2. If there is no final agreement about the plea to the indictment, or the basis of plea, and the defence nevertheless proceeds to seek an indication of sentence, which the judge appears minded to give, the prosecution advocate should remind him or her of the guidance given in R v Goodyear (Karl) [2005] EWCA 888 that normally speaking an indication of sentence should not be given until the basis of the plea has been agreed or the judge has concluded that he or she can properly deal with the case without the need for a trial of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D3. If an indication is sought, the prosecution advocate should normally enquire whether the judge is in possession of or has access to all the evidence relied on by the prosecution, including any victim personal statement, as well as any information about relevant previous convictions recorded against the defendant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D4. Before the judge gives the indication, the prosecution advocate should draw the judge’s attention to any minimum or mandatory statutory sentencing requirements. Where the prosecution advocate would be expected to offer the judge assistance with relevant guideline cases or the views of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, he or she should invite the judge to allow them to do so. Where it applies, the prosecution advocate should remind the judge that the position of the Attorney General to refer any sentencing decision as unduly lenient is unaffected. In any event, the prosecution advocate should not say anything which may create the impression that the sentence indication has the support or approval of the Crown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="e-pleas-in-mitigation"&gt;E: Pleas in mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E1. The prosecution advocate must challenge any assertion by the defence in mitigation which is derogatory to a person’s character, (for instance, because it suggests that his or her conduct is or has been criminal, immoral or improper) and which is either false or irrelevant to proper sentencing considerations. If the defence advocate persists in that assertion, the prosecution advocate should invite the court to consider holding a Newton hearing to determine the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E2. The defence advocate must not submit in mitigation anything that is derogatory to a person’s character without giving advance notice in writing so as to afford the prosecution advocate the opportunity to consider their position under paragraph E1. When the prosecution advocate is so notified they must take all reasonable steps to establish whether the assertions are true. Reasonable steps will include seeking the views of the victim. This will involve seeking the views of the victim’s family if the victim is deceased, and the victim’s parents or legal guardian where the victim is a child. Reasonable steps may also include seeking the views of the police or other law enforcement authority, as appropriate. An assertion which is derogatory to a person’s character will rarely amount to mitigation unless it has a causal connection to the circumstances of the offence or is otherwise relevant to proper sentencing considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E3. Where notice has not been given in accordance with paragraph E2, the prosecution advocate must not acquiesce in permitting mitigation which is derogatory to a person’s character. In such circumstances, the prosecution advocate should draw the attention of the court to the failure to give advance notice and seek time, and if necessary, an adjournment to investigate the assertion in the same way as if proper notice had been given. Where, in the opinion of the prosecution advocate, there are substantial grounds for believing that such an assertion is false or irrelevant to sentence, he or she should inform the court of their opinion and invite the court to consider making an order under section 58(8) of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, preventing publication of the assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E4. Where the prosecution advocate considers that the assertion is, if true, relevant to sentence, or the court has so indicated, he or she should seek time, and if necessary an adjournment, to establish whether the assertion is true. If the matter cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the parties, the prosecution advocate should invite the court to consider holding a Newton hearing to determine the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nomination of counsel from the Attorney General: how to apply</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the functions of the Attorney General is the appointment of all counsel who advise or appear on behalf of government. The recruitment process for the panel counsel system is designed to identify by open competition high calibre counsel willing to undertake government work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solicitor advocates or junior barristers are appointed either to the civil or criminal panel system. The civil panels consist of a combined regional panel and London A, B and C panels, depending on level of experience. The criminal panels are nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there will be occasions when it is necessary to instruct a QC and other occasions when no panel counsel with appropriate experience are available. In these circumstances, a department may ask the Law Officers to approve a nomination of counsel, either an off panel junior or a silk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-process-for-nominations"&gt;The process for nominations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a QC nomination or an off-panel civil junior counsel nomination the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off panel criminal juniors are appointed by the management board of the unified list (who report to the Law Officers). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject to this, the system is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A department identifies a need to instruct a QC, or, having looked thoroughly, cannot find available panel counsel with appropriate experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They identify suitable counsel and complete an &lt;abbr title="Attorney General's Office"&gt;AGO&lt;/abbr&gt; nominations proforma detailing the reasons for their choice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The request is considered by the Law Officers and approval is either granted or denied&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If granted, the department is informed, and instruct counsel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If denied, the department is informed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; to request a nomination of counsel proforma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When filling out the proforma, please ensure that the boxes on question 4 are marked in this order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left double-click the boxes to check &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select ‘checked’ in the pop-up box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click ‘Ok’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also ensure the name of the case is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once completed, send to &lt;a href="mailto:nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For help, call the &lt;abbr title="Attorney General's Office"&gt;AGO&lt;/abbr&gt; on 020 7271 2501.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please request a proforma for each new request as it is revised from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Consent of the Attorney General to prosecute: how to apply</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some offences cannot be prosecuted without the agreement of the Attorney General. These are called Attorney General ‘consent’ cases and consent can be given by either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General (known as the Law Officers). The timing of when consent is required varies depending on the charge but as a matter of good practice, Attorney General’s consent should be obtained at the earliest reasonable opportunity. You should always check the time by which consent needs to be in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Crown Prosecution Service has more detailed guidance on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/consent_to_prosecute/"&gt;consents to prosecute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Prosecuting authorities should refer to their own internal guidance on seeking Attorney General’s consent. In this guidance ‘prosecutor’ means the person or organisation seeking the consent of the Attorney General to prosecute.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consent is needed for the prosecution of an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offence which itself requires consent. Consent is also needed for offences of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a substantive offence which requires consent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conspiracy in England and Wales may involve the doing of an act by one or more of the parties, or the happening of an event, in a place outside England and Wales which constitutes an offence in that other place. In these circumstances the consent of the Attorney General is required to prosecute the conspiracy in England and Wales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of offences which require Attorney General’s consent can be found on the Crown Prosecution Service web site under legal resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However you should always ensure that you satisfy yourself by reference to current legislation or up to date practitioner text books which offences require consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-prosecutors-role-in-applying-for-attorney-generals-consent"&gt;The prosecutor’s role in applying for Attorney General’s consent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to review the case and recommend suitable charges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;highlight public interest factors which may affect the decision to prosecute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to supply documents in accordance with the procedure set out below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-apply-for-law-officers-consent"&gt;How to apply for Law Officers’ consent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a checklist of material that should be provided (where relevant) to the Attorney General’s Office. Original documents should not be sent to the Attorney General’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft charges/indictment. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typed submission from the prosecutor which must: 
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contain an explanation of each charge in relation to each person it is proposed to prosecute, and the evidence that the prosecutor says makes it more likely than not that a magistrates’ court or jury will convict that person of the charge&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;list all the public interest factors which tend in favour of a prosecution and those which tend against. A list of some of the  public interest factors which might be relevant can be found in the Code for Crown Prosecutors although there may be others than the ones on that list
contain a summary of the facts&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;identify all the issues in the case&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;cross refer to statements, exhibits and other documents supplied; the relevant page numbers must be referred to in brackets. Markings must be then made in the margins on the cross-referenced page, highlighting the exact passage referred to&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;highlight any issues as to timing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;bring to the Attorney’s attention any other issues or sensitivities surrounding the matter; and &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;describe how the prosecution intends to put the case at court&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copies of key documents i.e. statements, documents and exhibits which show the evidence against the person it is proposed to prosecute.    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The details of the prosecutor making the application. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that the name and address of the person it is proposed to prosecute is stated accurately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications for consent should be sent to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="address"&gt;&lt;div class="adr org fn"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 
Deputy Director, Criminal Law
&lt;br&gt;Attorney General's Office 
&lt;br&gt;20 Victoria Street 
&lt;br&gt;London 
&lt;br&gt;SW1H 0NF 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where possible documents should be submitted electronically to &lt;a href="consents@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;consents@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where items are submitted by post only, if possible an email should be sent to &lt;a href="consents@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;consents@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; confirming that they have been sent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawyer at the Attorney General’s Office will then review the papers before placing them before the Attorney General or Solicitor General. If there are any items missing from the papers sent to us or more information is needed before the papers are looked at by a Law Officer, these will be requested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="timing-of-application-for-law-officers-consent"&gt;Timing of application for Law Officers’ consent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential that the Law Officers are allowed sufficient time to consider the case. The length of time required will depend on the nature and complexity of the case and the quality of the application. A minimum of 2 weeks will normally be required in a straightforward case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Giving communities more power in planning local development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want people to be able to influence decisions about new and modified buildings and facilities in their area.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have the right to get involved in development decisions that affect them but in practice they have often found it difficult to have a meaningful say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give people more control over the development of their local area, we are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving communities the power to set the priorities for local development through &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/neighbourhood-planning" title="Neighbourhood planning"&gt;neighbourhood planning&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requiring local planning authorities to draw up clear, up-to-date &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/local-plans" title="Local Plans"&gt;Local Plans&lt;/a&gt; that conforms with the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/making-the-planning-system-work-more-efficiently-and-effectively/supporting-pages/national-planning-policy-framework" title="National Planning Policy Framework"&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/a&gt;, meets local development needs and reflects local people’s views of how they wish their area to develop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving councils the power to raise money to support local infrastructure through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-development/supporting-pages/community-infrastructure-levy" title="Community infrastructure levy"&gt;community infrastructure levy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;giving councils new powers to stop unwanted development on gardens (so-called ‘garden grabbing’)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a commitment in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition_programme_for_government.pdf" title="Coalition agreement"&gt;coalition agreement (PDF 475KB)&lt;/a&gt; to give people more power over development in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Localism Act 2011 introduced new powers for people to make neighbourhood plans and neighbourhood planning orders, with reduced interference from central government. These new powers are in addition to existing opportunities for community involvement, which are already part of the planning system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-weve-consulted"&gt;Who we’ve consulted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government consulted on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/neighbourhood-planning-regulations--2" title="Neighbourhood planning regulations consultation"&gt;proposed regulations for neighbourhood planning&lt;/a&gt; between October 2011 and January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consulted on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/community-infrastructure-levy" title="Community infrastructure levy consultation"&gt;proposed changes to the community infrastructure levy&lt;/a&gt; between October and December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also consulted on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/local-planning-regulations" title="Local planning regulations consultation"&gt;proposed changes to the regulations which govern the process by which local councils prepare their development plans&lt;/a&gt; between July and October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bills-and-legislation"&gt;Bills and legislation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neighbourhood planning provisions are contained in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/contents/enacted" title="Localism Act 2011"&gt;Localism Act 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/637/contents/made" title="The Neighbourhood Planning (General) Regulations 2012"&gt;Neighbourhood planning legislation&lt;/a&gt; came into effect in April 2012. Further legislation covering the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2031/made" title="The Neighbourhood Planning (Referendums) Regulations 2012"&gt;referendum stage of neighbourhood planning&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 2 August 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/987/contents/made" title="Community Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) Regulations 2011"&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) Regulations 2011&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 6 April 2011.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2918/contents/made" title="The Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Community Infrastructure Levy Functions) Order 2011"&gt;The Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Community Infrastructure Levy Functions) Order 2011&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 7 December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2975/contents/made"&gt;The Community Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) Regulations 2012&lt;/a&gt; came into force on 29 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Applications for witness anonymity orders: the prosecutor's role</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which came into force on 1 January 2010, replaced the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-foreword"&gt;A: Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A1. Every defendant has a right to a fair trial. An important aspect of a fair trial is the right of the defendant to be confronted by, and to challenge, those who accuse him or her.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A2. Making an application for a witness anonymity order is therefore a serious step, to be taken by the prosecutor only where there are genuine grounds to believe that the court would not otherwise hear evidence that should be available to it in the interests of justice; that other measures falling short of anonymity would not be sufficient; and that the defendant will have a fair trial if the order is made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A3. Anonymous witness testimony is not necessarily incompatible with Article 6, even when it is the sole or decisive evidence against the accused. But whether the measures used to allow a witness to give evidence anonymously in any particular case would make the trial unfair has to be evaluated with care on the facts of each case.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A4. When assessing whether and in what terms to make an application for a witness anonymity order, prosecutors have overriding duties to be fair, independent and objective. These guidelines set out the overarching principles by which a prosecutor should consider, and if appropriate apply for, a witness anonymity order in accordance with the considerations set out in the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="b-the-prosecutors-duties"&gt;B: The prosecutor’s duties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B1. The effect of a witness anonymity order is to prevent the defendant from knowing the identity of a witness. Without this information the defendant’s ability to investigate and challenge the accuracy or credibility of the witness’s evidence may be limited.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B2. When considering whether to make a witness anonymity order the court will consider to what extent the defendant needs to know the identity of the witness in order to challenge the witness’s evidence effectively. This question will often be central to the question of whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the witness anonymity order sought would be consistent with a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B3. The prosecutor’s role is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to act with scrupulous fairness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to examine with care, and probe where appropriate, the material provided in support of the application and the evidential basis for it. Prosecutors should in particular objectively assess any statement made by the witness or witnesses in question and the grounds on which it is based&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to be satisfied before making the application that, viewed objectively, it can properly be said that the order is necessary and in the interests of justice and that the defendant can receive a fair trial &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to put before the court all material that is relevant to the application. Courts will rely to a significant extent upon the prosecutor and the investigator to provide relevant material. Material will be relevant if the prosecutor relies upon it to support the application, or if it may tend to undermine or qualify the justification for making the order at all, or for making it in the form sought by the prosecutor. Material is particularly relevant if credibility is or may be in issue, for example if there is a known link between the witness and the defendant or a co-accused&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to disclose as much relevant material to the defence as possible without identifying the witness, including material that may tend to cast doubt on the credibility, reliability or accuracy of the witness’s evidence  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;B4. The role of the prosecutor as an independent and impartial minister of justice is of paramount importance. Applications should only be authorised by prosecutors at an appropriately senior level within the prosecuting authority.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B5. The interests of justice include the interests of the victim or victims, the interests of the witness or witnesses, the interests of the defendant and any co-defendants and the wider public interest.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B6. Prosecutors should take all necessary and reasonable steps consistent with a fair trial and the interests of justice to ensure the safety of a witness or the avoidance of real harm to the public interest or the protection of property.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c-applications-by-defendants"&gt;C: Applications by defendants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C1. The Act permits a defendant (as well as a prosecutor) to apply for a Witness Anonymity Order. Prosecutors should respond to such applications independently and objectively. Prosecutors should examine critically, but fairly, the basis for any application and any material put forward in support of any application.	 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C2. The prosecutor should provide the court with all material within the prosecutor’s possession or control that is relevant to the defendant’s application.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="d-appointment-and-role-of-special-counsel-in-applications-for-witness-anonymity"&gt;D: Appointment and role of Special Counsel in applications for witness anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D1. The Act makes no statutory provision for the appointment of Special Counsel.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2. A criminal court may invite the Attorney General to appoint Special Counsel. However, in line with authority, such an appointment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should be regarded as ‘… exceptional, never automatic, a course of last and never first resort.’ R –v- H and R –v- C [2004] UKHL 3. The need for Special Counsel has to be shown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the court will take account of the seriousness of the issue that the court has to determine in the particular case. Whether credibility is at issue is likely to be an important consideration. The court will also need to consider the extent to which Special Counsel could further the defendant’s case&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the court itself can be expected to perform a role of testing and probing the case which is presented on the application. When coupled with the prosecutor’s duty to put all relevant material before the court, this may often be sufficient to enable a fair and informed decision to be reached without the need to appoint Special Counsel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;D3. Where appointed, the role of Special Counsel is to make representations on behalf of the accused in any closed proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D4. The Attorney General will consider each invitation to appoint Special Counsel on its merits, having regard to the all the relevant circumstances of the case. In particular, in this context, to the basis of the application, whether it is opposed, the basis upon which it is opposed and the particular considerations that the court wishes Special Counsel to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D5. A prosecutor making an application for a witness anonymity order should always be prepared to assist the court to consider whether the circumstances are such that exceptionally the appointment of Special Counsel may be called for. When appropriate a prosecutor should draw to the attention of the court any aspect of an application for a witness anonymity order or any aspect of the case that may, viewed objectively, call for the appointment of Special Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D6. When a court decides to invite the Attorney General to appoint Special Counsel the prosecutor should (regardless of any steps taken by the court or any defendant) ensure that the Attorney General’s Office is promptly notified; and assist in ensuring that the Attorney General receives all the information needed to take a decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D7. Where Special Counsel is appointed, he or she will initially be provided by the prosecutor with any open material made available to the accused regarding the application (and any other open material requested by Special Counsel). Special Counsel may then seek instructions from the defendant and his legal representatives. Only then will Special Counsel be provided by the prosecutor with the closed or un-redacted material provided to the court.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the South West regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the South West regional planning guidance and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919194318/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationswrss"&gt;previous environmental report&lt;/a&gt; on the revocation of the South West regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the South West regional planning guidance and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S6 from the ‘Somerset and Exmoor National Park joint structure plan’ relating to the green belt in North East Somerset. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the coalition agreement to safeguard the green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the size of the documents this publication can also be supplied on a CD-ROM. Please email requests to &lt;a href="mailto:SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
