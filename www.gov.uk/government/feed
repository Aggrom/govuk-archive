    <title>Fishing industry regulations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fisheries regulations in England and Wales help maintain a compliant fishing industry in English and Welsh waters. Marine enforcement officers of the Marine Management Organisation (&lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt;) carry out inspections of fishing vessels to monitor compliance with &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and UK fisheries legislation. Inshore fisheries are separately managed by inshore fisheries and conservation authorities (&lt;abbr title="inshore fisheries and conservation authorities"&gt;IFCAs&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide outlines the procedures you need to be aware of regarding vessel inspections, both in harbour and at sea. It also explains the changes to inshore fisheries management and the powers that IFCA enforcement officers have to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-blue-book"&gt;The Blue Book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Book is a consolidated version of UK and &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; fisheries legislation. The &lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt; try to maintain The Blue Book with up-to-date legislation but cannot guarantee that it is up to date at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/regulations_bluebook.htm"&gt;More information on The Blue Book, including recent amendments and copies to download, on the &lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-to-expect-from-a-vessel-inspection-in-harbour"&gt;What to expect from a vessel inspection in harbour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine enforcement officers (&lt;abbr title="marine enforcement officers"&gt;MEOs&lt;/abbr&gt;) carry out inspections of fishing vessels either in harbour or at the time of landing to comply with &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and UK fisheries legislation. Inspections may be conducted at any time of the day or night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt; inspects vessels in a fair, courteous and professional way. During an inspection, &lt;abbr title="marine enforcement officers"&gt;MEOs&lt;/abbr&gt; will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify themselves when meeting you to inspect your vessel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;only board a vessel when they consider it safe to do so&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conduct a catch composition inspection on landing including a full box count and/or a check of weighing by species&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;undertake a vehicle inspection if the catch is to be transported to another port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-you-need-to-show-an-inspector"&gt;What you need to show an inspector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing vessel masters are expected to show full fisheries related documentation, catch and fishing gear. An inspector will check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;documents such as logbook, licence and variations and permits, fishroom plan and Certificate of Registry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;catch in the fishroom and compare this with the logbook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gear on deck, as it must conform to appropriate mesh sizes and dimensions for the fishing area and target species&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an onshore box count and of weighing methods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transport documents which must be carried for transportation of fish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;landing declaration for hake, cod and sole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/code-harbour.pdf"&gt;Download the code of conduct for vessel inspections in harbour from the &lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF 58KB).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an inspection, an MEO will advise fishers on fisheries regulations as appropriate. &lt;abbr title="marine enforcement officers"&gt;MEOs&lt;/abbr&gt; should investigate any apparent offences in a fair, impartial and professional manner, and avoid interfering unnecessarily with the landing of catches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a complaint about an inspection, you should contact your local marine area manager:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-to-expect-from-a-vessel-inspection-at-sea"&gt;What to expect from a vessel inspection at sea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="marine enforcement officers"&gt;MEOs&lt;/abbr&gt; carry out inspections of fishing vessels at sea to comply with &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; and UK fisheries legislation. Inspections at sea may happen during the day or night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt; inspects vessels in a fair and professional way and boarding teams aim to conduct inspections quickly so they do not hold up fishing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an inspection, fishing vessel masters should continue to use marine very high frequency (&lt;abbr title="very high frequency"&gt;VHF&lt;/abbr&gt;) radios and monitor &lt;abbr title="very high frequency"&gt;VHF&lt;/abbr&gt; channel 16 (the international calling and distress signal). They should respond when hailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspectors will usually give notice of an inspection and boarding, unless communication is not possible. Masters of fishing vessels should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure the safe embarkation of boarding teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provide a an appropriate boarding ladder &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provide a lee as necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-you-need-to-show-an-inspector-1"&gt;What you need to show an inspector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishing vessel masters are expected to show full fisheries-related documentation, catch and fishing gear. This includes checking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;documents such as logbook, licence and variations and permits, fishroom plan and Certificate of Registry &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;assessment of catch in fishroom and comparison with logbook and weighing check&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gear for appropriate mesh sizes and dimensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/code-sea.pdf"&gt;Download the code of conduct for vessel inspections at sea from the &lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF 55KB).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any offences will be dealt with in a fair, impartial and professional manner and the MEO will advise fishers on fisheries regulations where appropriate. If you have a complaint about an inspection, you should contact your local district marine officer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="inshore-fisheries-management"&gt;Inshore fisheries management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, ten inshore fisheries and conservation authorities (&lt;abbr title="inshore fisheries and conservation authorities"&gt;IFCAs&lt;/abbr&gt;) have replaced sea fisheries committees (&lt;abbr title="sea fisheries committees"&gt;SFCs&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each IFCA manages an IFC district that covers part of the English coast that goes out to six nautical miles and its inland boundaries align with those of its constituent local authorities. &lt;abbr title="inshore fisheries and conservation authorities"&gt;IFCAs&lt;/abbr&gt; also manage sea fisheries resources in estuaries that fall within their districts. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/documents/interim2/ifca-map.pdf"&gt;Download a map of the IFCA districts from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (&lt;abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"&gt;Defra&lt;/abbr&gt;) website (PDF 589KB).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="inshore fisheries and conservation authorities"&gt;IFCAs&lt;/abbr&gt; have powers in regards to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boarding and inspecting vessels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;entering and inspecting premises, dwellings and vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inspecting documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="inshore fisheries and conservation authorities"&gt;IFCAs&lt;/abbr&gt; have powers to make byelaws to manage sea fisheries resources within their districts and for wider environmental purposes - eg the protection of species and habitats from fishing activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each IFCA governing committee is made up of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one seat each for representatives from the Marine Management Organisation (&lt;abbr title="Marine Management Organisation"&gt;MMO&lt;/abbr&gt;), the Environment Agency and Natural England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;elected representatives of county and unitary local authorities in the district&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;members who understand the needs and opinions of the local fishing community, and who have knowledge of marine environmental matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Classify imports and exports using the UK Integrated Tariff</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All UK businesses must declare any imports or exports to &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; to ensure that any import VAT, duty, excise or levies due on them under UK and European law are collected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How different goods are classified largely determines what duties and controls apply to them. &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; uses commodity codes found in the UK Integrated Trade Tariff (the Tariff) to classify individual products. Classification of commodities is necessary for import and export declarations as well as Intrastat returns. Other government departments also rely on Tariff classification for licences and other documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out in this section about the role of the Tariff when classifying your goods. The guide also provides information about useful resources and services that are available to help you, including the Tariff Classification Service, which can provide legally binding advice and decisions on the classification of the goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"&gt;online UK Trade Tariff tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-classifying-your-goods"&gt;The importance of classifying your goods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you intend to move goods to and from the UK it’s essential that they’re classified in order to identify what duties and controls apply and ensure a correct customs declaration. Whether or not you have an agent who handles customs entries on your behalf, you have a legal responsibility to ensure the correct classification is applied. Incorrect classification can lead to delays in clearing goods, overpayment of duty and possible penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; uses classification information to collect data and trade statistics. Classify your goods correctly as it will help to ensure that you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay the correct amount of duty and VAT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;know if duty is suspended on any of your goods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;know if any preferential duty rates can be applied&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;know whether you need to obtain an import or export licence - for plant and animal products on health and conservation grounds or for firearms and hazardous materials&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;know whether excise or anti-dumping duties apply (dumping relates to goods that are exported from one country to another at a lower than normal price)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avoid paying interest on back-payments for incorrect classification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avoid seizure of your goods or delays to their movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many goods are subject to specific controls - eg those falling under the Common Agricultural Policy (&lt;abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy"&gt;CAP&lt;/abbr&gt;) of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; or those subject to anti-dumping duties or tariff quotas. By correctly classifying these products you’ll know what measures apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="call-to-action"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"&gt;online UK Trade Tariff tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tariff is based on the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;abbr title="Tariff Integre Communautaire"&gt;TARIC&lt;/abbr&gt; (TARiff Integre Communautaire). Member states of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; hold commodity codes in the &lt;abbr title="Tariff Integre Communautaire"&gt;TARIC&lt;/abbr&gt;. Commodity codes and other regulations are updated daily which ensures that importers and exporters can rely on the same standards and treatment throughout the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. The UK Trade Tariff uses the daily updates of the &lt;abbr title="Tariff Integre Communautaire"&gt;TARIC&lt;/abbr&gt; directly so that Tariff users have access to consistently accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally correct classification relies on supporting resources such as &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; industry specific classification guides, Harmonised System Explanatory Notes and Combined Nomenclature Explanatory Notes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-the-tariff"&gt;The role of the Tariff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to classify your goods you’ll need to make use of the Integrated Tariff of the UK - commonly known as the Tariff. This is a large document containing a product coding system which provides a comprehensive guide to importing and exporting. You can buy it in binder form or access it online. Volume 2 of the Tariff contains a list of commodity codes that &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; uses to determine the class under which exports and imports are entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commodity code is a ten digit number although an additional four digits may apply to certain products. For imports from outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; it’s necessary to provide the full Tariff classification. For exports the first eight digits are sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariff classification in the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; is based on the harmonised system which defines the first six digits. Although many countries subscribe to the same Tariff classification system, actual classifications may differ. The following diagram sets the structure of the &lt;abbr title="Tariff Integre Communautaire"&gt;TARIC&lt;/abbr&gt; codes and additional codes - ‘HS’ refers to ‘Harmonised System’ and ‘CN’ refers to ‘Combined Nomenclature’.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you rely on the classification from your overseas supplier, you’ll need to check whether it’s applicable to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;amp;propertyType=document&amp;amp;id=HMCE_CL_001194"&gt;Find out about the CPC on the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tariff is published as a whole every year, is updated monthly and is based on &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; legislation. It is made up of three volumes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume 1 contains essential background information for importers and exporters. It covers duty relief schemes, contact addresses for organisations such as the Department for Business Enterprise &amp;amp; Regulatory Reform, the Defra and the Forestry Commission. It also contains an explanation of excise duty, Tariff quotas and many similar topics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volume 2 contains a schedule of duty rates and trade statistical descriptions on 16,600 commodity codes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volume 3 contains a box-by-box completion guide for import and export entries - the Single Administrative Document (&lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt;), or form C88, the complete list of CPCs for importing and exporting, the country codes for the world, lists of UK docks and airports both alphabetically and by their Entry Processing Unit numbers, and further general information about importing or exporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="classifying-your-goods"&gt;Classifying your goods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before completing the &lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt; you need to know how to use the Tariff’s general rules to classify your goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="general-rules-for-classification-using-the-tariff"&gt;General Rules for classification using the Tariff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the correct code for your goods, use the General Rules contained in the Tariff. There are six rules which should be applied in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;covers the main headings under which goods are classed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;covers incomplete or unfinished articles and articles of mixed materials or substances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;covers goods which can be classified under more than one description - it also covers composite goods of different materials and sets for retail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;covers goods which can’t be classified using the first three rules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;covers packaging items that come with the goods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;covers subheadings under which goods are classed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to apply these rules correctly you’ll need to be able to describe your goods accurately. Many manufactured items are made up of several parts. If you’re trading in foodstuffs or domestic products, for example, you need to know what they contain before you consult the Tariff. This will help make your classification as accurate as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a fully assembled bicycle is classified as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Classification&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chapter 87&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;vehicles, other than railway or tramway rolling-stock and parts and accessories thereof&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Heading 8712&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;bicycles and other cycles (including delivery tricycles), not motorised&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Subheading 8712 00&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;other&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CN Code 8712 00 30&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;bicycles&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Tariff Integre Communautaire"&gt;TARIC&lt;/abbr&gt; 8712 00 30 00&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;(in this example there is no &lt;abbr title="Tariff Integre Communautaire"&gt;TARIC&lt;/abbr&gt; addition so the CN code is simply extended by two zeros)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules 2, 3 and 4 are used less frequently than the others and you should seek help from the Tariff Classification Service when referring to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt; is used to declare goods that are moved from one part of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; to another. This form can be completed manually or electronically although manual submissions may well take longer to process. You can register for electronic declarations via the government Gateway website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have found the commodity code matching the description of your goods enter it in box 33 of the &lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt; - a copy of which can be found in Volume 3 of the Tariff. Alternatively, you can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;amp;propertyType=document&amp;amp;id=HMCE_CL_000465"&gt;find the &lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt; form on the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also enter the customs procedure code that applies to you in box 37 of the &lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt;. These two entries will determine how your goods will be treated by customs officials in the country of importation. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;amp;propertyType=document&amp;amp;id=HMCE_CL_001193"&gt;Read about the &lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt; on the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="where-to-find-the-tariff"&gt;Where to find the Tariff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Trade Tariff is available online for most of the information you’ll need to import or export and there are helpful tools for managing your Tariff information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-tariff-classification-service"&gt;The Tariff Classification Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further clarification, contact the Tariff Classification Service (&lt;abbr title="Tariff Classification Service"&gt;TCS&lt;/abbr&gt;) who will provide advice on up to three items for import or export per call. Goods are divided into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 1: Food, animals, plastics, rubber and textiles including garments.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Option 2: Electrical and mechanical items, miscellaneous goods including printed matter, wood and vehicles. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Option 0: For a legally binding tariff information (&lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt;) application form or view the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; website at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/"&gt;www.hmrc.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; keying &lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; in the search engine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like customs to make a binding decision on correct classification of your goods, apply for Binding Tariff Information (&lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt;) from the &lt;abbr title="Tariff Classification Service"&gt;TCS&lt;/abbr&gt; using form C103.
 &lt;br&gt;
To obtain a &lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; application form call the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; Tariff Classification Service enquiry line on 01702 366 077. You can also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;amp;id=HMCE_PROD_010642&amp;amp;propertyType=document"&gt;find out about electronic &lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; on the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; will be legally binding throughout the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; for up to six years after the date of issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; is usually free. You will have to pay costs incurred through laboratory analysis, obtaining expert advice and returning your samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; provides you with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the correct commodity code for your goods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a detailed description of your goods, enabling any customs regime to identify them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;legal justification for the decision &lt;abbr title="Tariff Classification Service"&gt;TCS&lt;/abbr&gt; has reached&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a unique reference number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; can only be obtained before any customs procedures take place. Your request may be refused altogether if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t plan to import or export the goods in question&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have made a similar application in another &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; member state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can’t provide complete information about your goods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter your &lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; reference number in Box 44 of the &lt;abbr title="Single Administrative Document"&gt;SAD&lt;/abbr&gt; which must accompany your goods throughout the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. See declarations and the SAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should complete a separate application form for each type of item you want classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; appeals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unhappy with a &lt;abbr title="Binding Tariff Information"&gt;BTI&lt;/abbr&gt; decision you may lodge an appeal with &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt;. You have 45 days to request an independent review of the decision. If you’re unhappy with the review you have 30 days to apply for a tribunal hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-help-with-classification-of-import-or-export-goods"&gt;Further help with classification of import or export goods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many resources available to help you accurately classify your goods. Volume one of the Tariff provides much of this information. In Part 1, you’ll find a list of other publications which are available to help you with classification, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (HSENs). These give useful guidance on the scope of Tariff chapters, headings and sub-headings. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://wcoomdpublications.org/explanatory-notes-to-the-harmonized-system.html?___store=english&amp;amp;___from_store=english"&gt;buy HSENs on the World Customs Organisation (WCO) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combined Nomenclature Explanatory Notes (CNENs). These are supplementary to the HSENS. They are available on the European Commission site, and are updated once a year. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm"&gt;Find the CNENs on the Europa website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Compendium of Classification Opinions. These deal with decisions taken by the Harmonised System Committee which confirm classifications which were in doubt. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://wcoomdpublications.org/catalogsearch/result/?q=Compendium+of+Classification+Opinions"&gt;buy the Compendium of Classification Opinions on the WCO website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want practical help on how to use the Tariff and HSENs you may request education from the Tariff Classification Service. You can call the &lt;abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs"&gt;HMRC&lt;/abbr&gt; Tariff Classification Service enquiry line on 01702 366 077.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Changes to the driving licence and categories</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 19 January 2013 the European Union Third Directive on driving licences comes into force. All new driving licences from this date will have to meet the terms of the Directive. The changes will mainly affect motorcyclists, lorry, bus and minibus drivers and those who tow trailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="your-licence-explained"&gt;Your licence explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="changes-to-the-front-of-the-licence"&gt;Changes to the front of the licence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following changes will apply to the front of new driving licences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all dates will be shown as DD.MM.YYYY&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;categories shown will be separated by a slash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the date in 4b will show the licence expiry date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="changes-to-the-back-of-the-licence"&gt;Changes to the back of the licence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the 15 October 2012 to 18 January 2013, you’ll be issued with either photocard licence example A or example B. From 19 January 2013 you’ll be issued a photocard licence showing example B only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="New driving licence photocard licence Example A" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1154/Card_01_960x640_01.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example A - issued from 15 October 2012 to 18 January 2013

1 - New design showing full table of categories, pictograms, start and expiry dates and any codes that apply
2 - Legend containing explanation of each field's contents
3 - Overflow of information/restriction codes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="New driving licence photocard licence Example B" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1155/Card_02_960x640_02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Example B - issued from 15 October 2012 to 18 January 2013

1 - New design showing full table of categories, pictograms, start and expiry dates and any codes that apply
2 - Legend containing explanation of each field's contents
3 - Overflow of information/restriction codes&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expiry date of your licence will be shown on the front in section 4b and the expiry date of your entitlements will be shown on the back of your licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new style licence will look different to the current licence. All vehicle categories will be listed on the back of your licence with dates against those you are entitled to drive or ride. You won’t be entitled to drive any category of vehicle that has lines instead of dates. However, if you have passed a test in a larger vehicle you may still be entitled to drive or ride smaller vehicles of that type which have lines shown instead of dates, eg holders of full category A would be entitled to ride a category A2 vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="licence-counterpart"&gt;Licence counterpart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your photocard licence is accompanied by a paper counterpart. The counterpart will contain your provisional driving entitlements, driving offences and other relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="lorry-bus-and-minibus-licence-holders"&gt;Lorry, bus and minibus licence holders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you apply to claim your first lorry or bus test pass or renew your driving licence on or after 19 January 2013, the licence issued will be valid for a maximum of 5 years. This affects you if you have passed driving tests for categories C1, C, D1, D, C1E, CE, D1E or DE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve been issued with a 5 year licence you’ll need to renew the licence when it expires - the licence expiry date is shown in 4b. To renew the licence and to renew your lorry and/or bus entitlement you’ll need to fill in the application and medical questions on an ‘Application for a lorry, bus or minibus driving licence’ (D2) or the renewal reminder form which we send you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already passed a driving test in one of the above categories, the new rules will apply when you next renew your driving licence or when you renew your lorry and/or bus entitlement, whichever is earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="your-categories-explained"&gt;Your categories explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mopeds-am-and-q"&gt;Mopeds (AM and q)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All licences issued on or after 19 January 2013 will show moped categories as AM and q in place of category p. But if you held full category p before this date you’ll keep this entitlement and it will be shown on your licence together with new categories AM and q. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="motorcycles-a1-a2-and-a"&gt;Motorcycles (A1, A2 and A)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different minimum age restrictions and power outputs for the different categories. If you are an existing tricycle rider you won’t lose the entitlement you currently hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests for mopeds with 3 or 4 wheels, A1 and A tricycles and sidecar combinations will only be offered to physically disabled drivers or riders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tricycles-am-a-and-a1"&gt;Tricycles (AM, A and A1)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are varied minimum age restrictions and power outputs for the different categories. If you are an existing tricycle rider you won’t lose the entitlement you currently hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests for mopeds with 3 or 4 wheels, A1 and A tricycles and sidecar combinations will only be offered to physically disabled drivers or riders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="drivers-who-tow-trailers"&gt;Drivers who tow trailers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve passed your car (category B) test on or after 19 January 2013 and you want to tow a trailer weighing more than 3,500 kilograms with a car or small vehicle (category B and B+E), then you’ll need to pass a test for category C1E. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got your driving entitlement before 19 January 2013 you will retain it. There are no further changes to rules on towing trailers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further information on towing trailers please see booklet &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/forms/~/media/pdf/leaflets/INF30.ashx"&gt;Requirements for towing trailers in Great Britain (INF30)&lt;/a&gt;(PDF 488kB).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jury vetting: right of stand by guidelines</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-exercise-by-the-crown-of-its-right-of-stand-by-update-2012"&gt;The exercise by the Crown of its right of stand by (update 2012)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1988 the defence right to challenge jurors without cause was abolished, the prosecution right to do so was, however, retained.  This means that the prosecution can object to a potential juror without giving any reason. It is recognised that this is an exceptional power and so the Attorney General, therefore, issues guidance to prosecutors on its use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the use of the right of stand by is limited to those cases which involve National Security or Terrorism. The Guidelines outline the circumstances in which it is appropriate for the prosecution to exercise this power and the procedure which is to be followed. The Guidelines make clear that the authority to use this power is limited to the Attorney General. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of the Guidelines included an annex prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on the conduct of inquiries into a juror’s previous convictions. This is now done automatically by Her Majesty’s Courts Service and therefore the ACPO guidance is no longer relevant and, in consequence, is not included in these 2012 Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="guidelines"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attorney General has issued the following guidelines on the exercise by the Crown in England and Wales of its right to stand by. The guidelines update the previous guidelines issued in 1989 to coincide with the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 s.118, which abolished the right of peremptory challenge. These updated guidelines are to have effect from the 27th November 2012. The Attorney General has also issued amended guidelines on jury checks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Although the law has long recognised the right of the Crown to exclude a member of a jury panel from sitting as a juror by the exercise in open court of the right to request a stand by or, if necessary, by challenge for cause, it has been customary for those instructed to prosecute on behalf of the Crown to assert that right only sparingly and in exceptional circumstances. It is generally accepted that the prosecution should not use its right in order to influence the overall composition of a jury or with a view to tactical advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.The approach outlined above is founded on the principles that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. the members of a jury should be selected at random from the panel subject to any rule of law as to right of challenge by the defence, and  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. the Juries Act 1974 identifies those classes of persons who alone are disqualified from or ineligible for service on a jury. No other class of person may be treated as disqualified or ineligible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.The enactment by Parliament of s.118 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 abolishing the right of defendants to remove jurors by means of peremptory challenge makes it appropriate that the Crown should assert its right to stand by only on the basis of clearly defined and restrictive criteria. Derogation from the principle that members of a jury should be selected at random should be permitted only where it is essential.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Primary responsibility for ensuring that an individual does not serve on a jury if he is not competent to discharge properly the duties of a juror rests with the appropriate court officer and, ultimately the trial judge. Current legislation provides, in ss.9 to s.10 of the Juries Act 1974, fairly wide discretion to excuse, defer or discharge jurors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.The circumstances in which it would be proper for the Crown to exercise its right to stand by a member of a jury panel are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. where a jury check authorised in accordance with the Attorney General’s Guidelines on Jury Checks reveals information justifying exercise of the right to stand by in accordance with para.11 of the guidelines below and the Attorney General personally authorises the exercise of the right to stand by; or  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. where a person is about to be sworn as a juror who is manifestly unsuitable and the defence agree that, accordingly, the exercise by the prosecution of the right to stand by would be appropriate. An example of the sort of exceptional circumstances which might justify stand by is where it becomes apparent that, despite the provisions mentioned in para.4 above, a juror selected for service to try a complex case is in fact illiterate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="jury-checks"&gt;Jury checks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.The principles which are generally to be observed are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. that members of a jury should be selected at random from the panel,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. the Juries Act 1974 identifies those classes of persons who alone are either disqualified from or ineligible for service on a jury; no other class of person may be treated as disqualified or ineligible,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. the correct way for the Crown to seek to exclude a member of the panel from sitting as a juror is by the exercise in open court of the right to request a stand by or, if necessary, to challenge for cause.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Parliament has provided safeguards against jurors who may be corrupt or biased. In addition to the provision for majority verdicts, there is the sanction of a criminal offence for a disqualified person to serve on a jury. The omission of a disqualified person from the panel is a matter for court officials - they will check criminal records for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not a potential juror is a disqualified person.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.There are, however, certain exceptional types of case of public importance for which the provisions as to majority verdicts and the disqualification of jurors may not be sufficient to ensure the proper administration of justice. In such cases it is in the interests of both justice and the public that there should be further safeguards against the possibility of bias and in such cases checks which go beyond the investigation of criminal records may be necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.These classes of case my be defined broadly as (a) cases in which national security is involved and part of the evidence is likely to be heard in camera, and (b) security and terrorist cases in which a juror’s extreme beliefs could prevent a fair trial.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.The particular aspects of these cases which may make it desirable to seek extra precautions are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. in security cases a danger that a juror, either voluntarily or under pressure, may make an improper use of evidence which, because of its sensitivity, has been given in camera,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. in both security and terrorist cases the danger that a juror’s personal beliefs are so biased as to go beyond normally reflecting the broad spectrum of views and interests in the community to reflect the extreme views of sectarian interest or pressure group to a degree which might interfere with his fair assessment of the facts of the case or lead him to exert improper pressure on his fellow jurors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.In order to ascertain whether in exceptional circumstances of the above nature either of these factors might seriously influence a potential juror’s impartial performance of his duties or his respecting the secrecy of evidence given in camera, it may be necessary to conduct a limited investigation of the panel. In general, such further investigation beyond one of criminal records made for disqualifications may only be made with the records of the police. However, a check may, additionally be made against the records of the Security Service. No checks other than on these sources and no general inquiries are to be made save to the limited extent that they may be needed to confirm the identity of a juror about whom the initial check has raised serious doubts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.No further investigation, as described in para.6 above, should be made save with the personal authority of the Attorney General on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions and such checks are hereafter referred to as “authorised checks”. When a chief officer of police or the prosecutor has reason to believe that it is likely that an authorised check may be desirable and proper in accordance with these guidelines, he should refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In those cases in which the Director of Public Prosecutions believes authorised checks are both proportionate and necessary, the Director will make an application to the Attorney General. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.The Director of Public Prosecutions will provide the Attorney General with all relevant information in support of the requested authorised checks.  The Attorney General will consider personally the request and, if appropriate, authorise the check. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.The result of any authorised check will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Director will then decide, having regard to the matters set out in para.5 above, what information ought to be brought to the attention of prosecuting counsel.  The Director will also provide the Attorney General with the result of the authorised check.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.Although the right of stand by and the decision to authorise checks are wholly within the discretion of the Attorney General, when the Attorney General has agreed to an authorised check being conducted, the Director of Public Prosecutions will write to the Presiding Judge for the area to advise him that this is being done.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11.No right of stand by should be exercised by counsel for the Crown on the basis of information obtained as a result of an authorised check save with the personal authority of the Attorney General and unless the information is such as, having regard to the facts of the case and the offences charged, to afford strong reason for believing that a particular juror might be a security risk, be susceptible to improper approaches or be influenced in arriving at a verdict for the reasons given above.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.Information revealed in the course of an authorised check must be considered in line with the normal rules on disclosure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13.A record is to be kept by the Director of Public Prosecutions of the use made by counsel of the information passed to him and of the jurors stood by or challenged by the parties to the proceedings. A copy of this record is to be forwarded to the Attorney General for the sole purpose of enabling him to monitor the operation of these guidelines.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14.No use of the information obtained as a result of an authorised check is to be made except as may be necessary in direct relation to or arising out of the trial for which the check was authorised.  The information may, however, be used for the prevention of crime or as evidence in a future criminal prosecution, save that material obtained from the Security Service may only be used in those circumstances with the authority of the Security Service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The acceptance of pleas and the prosecutor's role in the sentencing exercise</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-foreword"&gt;A: Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A1. Prosecutors have an important role in protecting the victim’s interests in the criminal justice process, not least in the acceptance of pleas and the sentencing exercise. The basis of plea, particularly in a case that is not contested, is the vehicle through which the victim’s voice is heard. Factual inaccuracies in pleas in mitigation cause distress and offence to victims, the families of victims and witnesses. This can take many forms but may be most acutely felt when the victim is dead and the family hears inaccurate assertions about the victim’s character or lifestyle. Prosecution advocates are reminded that they are required to adhere to the standards set out in the Victim’s Charter, which places the needs of the victim at the heart of the criminal justice process, and that they are subject to a similar obligation in respect of the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A2. The principle of fairness is central to the administration of justice. The implementation of Human Rights Act 1998 in October 2000 incorporated into domestic law the principle of fairness to the accused articulated in the European Convention on Human Rights. Accuracy and reasonableness of plea plays an important part in ensuring fairness both to the accused and to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A3. The Attorney General’s guidelines on the acceptance of pleas issued on December 7, 2000 highlighted the importance of transparency in the conduct of justice. The basis of plea agreed by the parties in a criminal trial is central to the sentencing process. An illogical or unsupported basis of plea can lead to an unduly lenient sentence being passed, and has a consequential effect where consideration arises as to whether to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A4. These guidelines, which replace the guidelines issued in October 2005, give guidance on how prosecutors should meet these objectives of protection of victims’ interests and of securing fairness and transparency in the process. They take into account paragraphs IV.45.4 and following of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction, amended May 2009 and the guidance issued by the Court of Appeal (Criminal) Division in R v Beswick [1996] 1 Cr.App.R. 343, R v Tolera [1999] 1 Cr.App.R. 25 and R v Underwood [2005] 1 Cr.App.R 178. They complement the Bar Council guidance on written standards for the conduct of professional work issued with the 7th edition of the code of conduct for the Bar of England and Wales and the Law Society’s professional conduct rules. When considering the acceptance of a guilty plea prosecution advocates are also reminded of the need to apply ‘The Farquharson Guidelines on The Role and Responsibilities of the Prosecution Advocate’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A5. The guidelines should be followed by all prosecutors and those persons designated under section 7 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (designated caseworkers) and apply to prosecutions conducted in England and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="b-general-principles"&gt;B: General principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B1. Justice in this jurisdiction, save in the most exceptional circumstances, is conducted in public. This includes the acceptance of pleas by the prosecution and sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B2. The Code for Crown Prosecutors governs the prosecutor’s decision-making prior to the commencement of the trial hearing and sets out the circumstances in which pleas to a reduced number of charges, or less serious charges, can be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B3. When a case is listed for trial and the prosecution form the view that the appropriate course is to accept a plea before the proceedings commence or continue, or to offer no evidence on the indictment or any part of it, the prosecution should whenever practicable speak to the victim or the victim’s family, so that the position can be explained. The views of the victim or the family may assist in informing the prosecutor’s decision as to whether it is the public interest, as defined by the Code for Crown Prosecutors, to accept or reject the plea. The victim or victim’s family should then be kept informed and decisions explained once they are made at court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B4. The appropriate disposal of a criminal case after conviction is as much a part of the criminal justice process as the trial of guilt or innocence. The prosecution advocate represents the public interest, and should be ready to assist the court to reach its decision as to the appropriate sentence. This will include drawing the court’s attention to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any victim personal statement or other information available to the prosecution advocate as to the impact of the offence on the victim &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;where appropriate, to any evidence of the impact of the offending on a community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any statutory provisions relevant to the offender and the offences under consideration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any relevant sentencing guidelines and guideline cases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the aggravating and mitigating factors of the offence under consideration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;B5. The prosecution advocate may also offer assistance to the court by making submissions, in the light of all these factors, as to the appropriate sentencing range. In all cases, it is the prosecution advocate’s duty to apply for appropriate ancillary orders, such as anti-social behaviour orders and confiscation orders. When considering which ancillary orders to apply for, prosecution advocates must always have regard to the victim’s needs, including the question of his or her future protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c-the-basis-of-plea"&gt;C: The basis of plea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C1. The basis of a guilty plea must not be agreed on a misleading or untrue set of facts and must take proper account of the victim’s interests. An illogical or insupportable basis of plea will inevitably result in the imposition of an inappropriate sentence and is capable of damaging public confidence in the criminal justice system. In cases involving multiple defendants the bases of plea for each defendant must be factually consistent with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C2. When the defendant indicates an acceptable plea, the defence advocate should reduce the basis of the plea to writing. This must be done in all cases save for those in which the defendant has indicated that the guilty plea has been or will be tendered on the basis of the prosecution case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C3. The written basis of plea must be considered with great care, taking account of the position of any other relevant defendant where appropriate. The prosecution should not lend itself to any agreement whereby a case is presented to the sentencing judge on a misleading or untrue set of facts or on a basis that is detrimental to the victim’s interests. There will be cases where a defendant seeks to mitigate on the basis of assertions of fact which are outside the scope of the prosecution’s knowledge. A typical example concerns the defendant’s state of mind. If a defendant wishes to be sentenced on this basis, the prosecution advocate should invite the judge not to accept the defendant’s version unless he or she gives evidence on oath to be tested in cross-examination. Paragraph IV.45.14 of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction states that in such circumstances the defence advocate should be prepared to call the defendant and, if the defendant is not willing to testify, subject to any explanation that may be given, the judge may draw such inferences as appear appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C4. The prosecution advocate should show the prosecuting authority any written record relating to the plea and agree with them the basis on which the case will be opened to the court. If, as may well be the case, the basis of plea differs in its implications for sentencing or the making of ancillary orders from the case originally outlined by the prosecution, the prosecution advocate must ensure that such differences are accurately reflected in the written record prior to showing it to the prosecuting authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C5. It is the responsibility of the prosecution advocate thereafter to ensure that the defence advocate is aware of the basis on which the plea is accepted by the prosecution and the way in which the prosecution case will be opened to the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C6. In all cases where it is likely to assist the court where the sentencing issues are complex or unfamiliar the prosecution must add to the written outline of the case which is served upon the court a summary of the key considerations. This should take the form of very brief notes on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any relevant statutory limitations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the names of any relevant sentencing authorities or guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the scope for any ancillary orders (eg concerning anti-social behaviour, confiscation or deportation will need to be considered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the age of the defendant and information regarding any outstanding offences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;C7. It remains open to the prosecutor to provide further written information (for example to supplement and update the analysis at later stages of the case) where he or she thought that likely to assist the court, or if the judge requests it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C8. When the prosecution advocate has agreed the written basis of plea submitted by the defence advocate, he or she should endorse the document accordingly. If the prosecution advocate takes issue with all or part of the written basis of plea, the procedure set out in the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction (and in Part 37.10(5) of the Criminal Procedure Rules) should be followed. The defendant’s basis of plea must be set out in writing identifying what is in dispute; the court may invite the parties to make representations about whether the dispute is material to sentence; and if the court decides that it is a material dispute, the court will invite further representations or evidence as it may require and decide the dispute in accordance with the principles set out in R v Newton, 77 Cr.App.R.13, CA. The signed original document setting out the disputed factual matters should be made available to the trial judge and thereafter lodged with the court papers, as it will form part of the record of the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C9. Where the basis of plea cannot be agreed and the discrepancy between the two accounts is such as to have a potentially significant effect on the level of sentence, it is the duty of the defence advocate so to inform the court before the sentencing process begins. There remains an overriding duty on the prosecution advocate to ensure that the sentencing judge is made aware of the discrepancy and of the consideration which must be given to holding a Newton hearing to resolve the issue. The court should be told where a derogatory reference to a victim, witness or third party is not accepted, even though there may be no effect on sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C10. As emphasised in paragraph IV.45.10 of the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction, whenever an agreement as to the basis of plea is made between the prosecution and defence, any such agreement will be subject to the approval of the trial judge, who may of his or her own motion disregard the agreement and direct that a Newton hearing should be held to determine the proper basis on which sentence should be passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C11. Where a defendant declines to admit an offence that he or she previously indicated should be taken into consideration, the prosecution advocate should indicate to the defence advocate and the court that, subject to further review, the offence may now form the basis of a new prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="d-sentence-indications"&gt;D: Sentence indications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D1. Only in the Crown Court may sentence indications be sought. Advocates there are reminded that indications as to sentence should not be sought from the trial judge unless issues between the prosecution and defence have been addressed and resolved. Therefore, in difficult or complicated cases, no less than seven days notice in writing of an intention to seek an indication should normally be given to the prosecution and the court. When deciding whether the circumstances of a case require such notice to be given, defence advocates are reminded that prosecutors should not agree a basis of plea unless and until the necessary consultation has taken place first with the victim and/or the victim’s family and second, in the case of an independent prosecution advocate, with the prosecuting authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D2. If there is no final agreement about the plea to the indictment, or the basis of plea, and the defence nevertheless proceeds to seek an indication of sentence, which the judge appears minded to give, the prosecution advocate should remind him or her of the guidance given in R v Goodyear (Karl) [2005] EWCA 888 that normally speaking an indication of sentence should not be given until the basis of the plea has been agreed or the judge has concluded that he or she can properly deal with the case without the need for a trial of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D3. If an indication is sought, the prosecution advocate should normally enquire whether the judge is in possession of or has access to all the evidence relied on by the prosecution, including any victim personal statement, as well as any information about relevant previous convictions recorded against the defendant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D4. Before the judge gives the indication, the prosecution advocate should draw the judge’s attention to any minimum or mandatory statutory sentencing requirements. Where the prosecution advocate would be expected to offer the judge assistance with relevant guideline cases or the views of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, he or she should invite the judge to allow them to do so. Where it applies, the prosecution advocate should remind the judge that the position of the Attorney General to refer any sentencing decision as unduly lenient is unaffected. In any event, the prosecution advocate should not say anything which may create the impression that the sentence indication has the support or approval of the Crown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="e-pleas-in-mitigation"&gt;E: Pleas in mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E1. The prosecution advocate must challenge any assertion by the defence in mitigation which is derogatory to a person’s character, (for instance, because it suggests that his or her conduct is or has been criminal, immoral or improper) and which is either false or irrelevant to proper sentencing considerations. If the defence advocate persists in that assertion, the prosecution advocate should invite the court to consider holding a Newton hearing to determine the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E2. The defence advocate must not submit in mitigation anything that is derogatory to a person’s character without giving advance notice in writing so as to afford the prosecution advocate the opportunity to consider their position under paragraph E1. When the prosecution advocate is so notified they must take all reasonable steps to establish whether the assertions are true. Reasonable steps will include seeking the views of the victim. This will involve seeking the views of the victim’s family if the victim is deceased, and the victim’s parents or legal guardian where the victim is a child. Reasonable steps may also include seeking the views of the police or other law enforcement authority, as appropriate. An assertion which is derogatory to a person’s character will rarely amount to mitigation unless it has a causal connection to the circumstances of the offence or is otherwise relevant to proper sentencing considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E3. Where notice has not been given in accordance with paragraph E2, the prosecution advocate must not acquiesce in permitting mitigation which is derogatory to a person’s character. In such circumstances, the prosecution advocate should draw the attention of the court to the failure to give advance notice and seek time, and if necessary, an adjournment to investigate the assertion in the same way as if proper notice had been given. Where, in the opinion of the prosecution advocate, there are substantial grounds for believing that such an assertion is false or irrelevant to sentence, he or she should inform the court of their opinion and invite the court to consider making an order under section 58(8) of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, preventing publication of the assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E4. Where the prosecution advocate considers that the assertion is, if true, relevant to sentence, or the court has so indicated, he or she should seek time, and if necessary an adjournment, to establish whether the assertion is true. If the matter cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the parties, the prosecution advocate should invite the court to consider holding a Newton hearing to determine the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nomination of counsel from the Attorney General: how to apply</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the functions of the Attorney General is the appointment of all counsel who advise or appear on behalf of government. The recruitment process for the panel counsel system is designed to identify by open competition high calibre counsel willing to undertake government work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solicitor advocates or junior barristers are appointed either to the civil or criminal panel system. The civil panels consist of a combined regional panel and London A, B and C panels, depending on level of experience. The criminal panels are nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there will be occasions when it is necessary to instruct a QC and other occasions when no panel counsel with appropriate experience are available. In these circumstances, a department may ask the Law Officers to approve a nomination of counsel, either an off panel junior or a silk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-process-for-nominations"&gt;The process for nominations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a QC nomination or an off-panel civil junior counsel nomination the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off panel criminal juniors are appointed by the management board of the unified list (who report to the Law Officers). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subject to this, the system is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A department identifies a need to instruct a QC, or, having looked thoroughly, cannot find available panel counsel with appropriate experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They identify suitable counsel and complete an &lt;abbr title="Attorney General's Office"&gt;AGO&lt;/abbr&gt; nominations proforma detailing the reasons for their choice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The request is considered by the Law Officers and approval is either granted or denied&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If granted, the department is informed, and instruct counsel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If denied, the department is informed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; to request a nomination of counsel proforma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When filling out the proforma, please ensure that the boxes on question 4 are marked in this order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left double-click the boxes to check &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Click ‘Ok’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also ensure the name of the case is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once completed, send to &lt;a href="mailto:nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;nominations@attorneygeneral.gsi.gov.uk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
