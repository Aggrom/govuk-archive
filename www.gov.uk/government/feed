    <title>Foreign Office Minister deeply concerned by conflict in Burma</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Rt Hon Hugo Swire MP expressed dismay today at the ongoing violence in Kachin state in Burma.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Rt Hon Hugo Swire MP said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict between the Burmese Army and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in Burma’s Kachin State, including recent reports of air strikes in the state. An escalation in hostilities would put at risk the chance of a lasting peace in Burma. It is imperative that military commanders in Burma heed their President’s calls for an end to hostilities. I raised these concerns with the Burmese government during my visit last month. It is important that all sides, including the KIA, come to the negotiating table and make renewed efforts to work towards lasting peace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During my meetings with the Burmese government I highlighted the importance of normalising the role of the Burmese military. Lasting democratic reform in Burma will not be successful unless they come under the direct authority of the Burmese government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK continues to support the peace process in Burma directly. We are working with experts with experience of inter-communal trust and peace-building in Northern Ireland to encourage Burma’s own reconciliation efforts. The UK is also contributing £3.5 million in humanitarian food aid for civilians displaced by fighting across Kachin State, including in non-government controlled areas. During my visit I stressed the importance of allowing the unhindered supply of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population. We will continue to work closely with humanitarian partners to monitor needs in the event of any further civilian displacement.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Ministers urge progress between Sudan and South Sudan</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>UK, US and Norway say that Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan must seize the opportunity for peace now.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan are to meet in Addis Ababa on 4 January. In a joint statement, Foreign Ministers from the ‘Sudan Troika’ are calling for the two countries to implement agreements on border security and oil, and to resolve all other outstanding issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint statement by Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the news that the Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan are to meet in Addis Ababa on 4 January in a further effort to resolve outstanding issues between the two countries. We applaud the progress made at their Presidential Summit held in Addis Ababa at the end of September 2012, which demonstrated that a durable and equitable settlement is within reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We commend the continuing valuable role of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel led by former President Thabo Mbeki and the efforts of Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We regret that progress in implementing the Agreements signed on 27 September has stalled and in particular that the agreed security arrangements at the border are not yet in place. We call on the two leaders now to address concretely all outstanding issues and ensure that the armed forces of the two countries immediately withdraw from the demilitarised zone and deploy the Joint Border and Verification and Monitoring Mechanism (JBVMM), in line with what has been agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We stress the importance of making progress in parallel on other parts of the relationship between the two countries. Full implementation of all agreements on their own terms and without preconditions or linkages between them, will help build confidence and benefit the people of the two countries. The restart of oil production and export will be particularly valuable for both economies and should not be held up by negotiation on other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We underline our support for the approach taken by the African Union to the question of Abyei. The proposal made by former President Mbeki is based on the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, including the Abyei Protocol. The proposal, adopted by AUPSC on October 24, sets out a clear path towards determining Abyei’s final status in accordance with agreements already signed by both parties, while protecting the rights of all communities and ensuring Abyei can become a model for cross-border cooperation and coexistence. We note in particular that the proposal provides for Abyei’s continuing special status as a bridge between the two countries with guaranteed political and economic rights for both the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya, whatever the outcome of the referendum. We urge the two countries to meet to elaborate on these rights and to move toward agreement on Abyei’s final status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We remind the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan that the international community is fully committed to a vision of two viable countries at peace with one another, and that we stand ready to support them in realising that vision. We strongly urge them to seize the opportunity of the Summit meeting on 4 January to demonstrate their commitment to implement what they have agreed and make peaceful co-existence a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Office condemns persecution of religious minorities in Iran</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt has condemned the re-arrest of Christian pastor in Iran.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on reports that Christian Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani had been re-arrested in Iran, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa Alistair Burt said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I condemn Iran’s decision to re-arrest the Christian Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani, and to do so on Christmas Day. In September I welcomed his release from prison, where he was detained on baseless charges of apostasy. That he has now been re-arrested, on the grounds of serving the remainder of his sentence for “evangelising Muslims”, is a cynical move by the Iranian Government and yet further proof of Iran’s widespread and systematic persecution of religious minorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Religious freedom in Iran is a matter of ongoing and deep concern. Reports that more than 50 people were arrested for celebrating Christmas in a private home show the depths of intolerance with which the Iranian Government treats its own citizens. Amongst those arrested, Reverend Vruir Avanessian, who suffers serious ill health, remains imprisoned. I call on the Iranian Government to release immediately any citizens who remain in prison on the basis of their faith or belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Foreign Secretary discusses progress in Somalia with Foreign Minister </title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Foreign Secretary William Hague met the Somali Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Fawzia Yusuf H. Adam today.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the meeting, the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am delighted to have met Foreign Minister Fawzia Yusuf H. Adam in her first visit to the UK in her new role. Somalia has made tangible progress in recent months, both politically following the end of the transitional period, and in improving security, with Al Shabab pushed from major towns. It is critical that this momentum continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Minister outlined the Somali government’s plans to tackle the challenges ahead including improving security, increasing access to justice, transparent financial management, political reconciliation and economic development. The UK is committed to working in partnership with the Somali government to support these priorities and to ensure coordinated international assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Keeping the UK military on the map</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The experts at the Defence Geographic Centre near London are keeping UK Armed Forces worldwide on the right track. Report by Ian Carr.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Australian scientists went to have a look at Sandy Island in the South Pacific recently, they discovered that, despite having featured on maps and on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/earth/index.html" title="Google Earth UK homepage"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; for years, it doesn’t actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts working at the Defence Geographic Centre (&lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt;) may well have smiled wryly on hearing this. There is no room in their world for such errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt; provides geographic information to Defence, predominantly to the Army and the &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt;, but also to other government departments, and works in a world of international collaboration, sharing and co-producing geographical information where a reputation for accuracy matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt;’s geographers, or geospatial analysts as they prefer to be called, know that, if you rely on a map which hasn’t been created from entirely dependable source data, the result can get you into trouble. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A large printer at the Defence Geographic Centre" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5847/Replication.JPG"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Defence Geographic Centre has a full range of modern print and production equipment [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even the best maps are the result of compromise and estimate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unless you are on the ground looking at something, geographical information is always an approximation,” said Ian Spencer, Head of Geo Research. “We know how accurate our sources are, and the technical parameters of our sensors, so we know how accurate our products are. We have to work within a defined margin of error for each military product. If it’s outside that margin it’s considered unfit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that the &lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt; augments some of their products with open source material, such as Google Earth pictures, to provide pop-up images of features, but they do it knowing where the risks lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt; produces more than just maps, whether on paper or on a screen. After all, a map is just one way of presenting geographical information, and it might not be the best solution for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you might need a database of geographic data to put in a weapons system, or a 3D simulation created from stereoscopic photographs to prepare yourself for the environment through which you may have to fly and control a missile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt; specialises in making sense of a huge mass of data and presenting it to the customer in a way that is going to help them make sense of the world, spot relationships, and make informed plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We get 2 types of request,” said Operations Officer Major Jim Danks. “These are ad hoc for a single event or operation, such as disaster relief or support to the Arab Spring operations. And longer term planned work which can include Afghanistan tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A geospatial analyst using stereographic imagery" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5848/Workstation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A geospatial analyst using stereographic imagery to produce simulations [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A request may start as a one-off and then develop into a long-term requirement. When Camp Bastion was established more than a decade ago it started as an ad hoc request. Now, as a home for thousands of troops, it is a standard request requiring the provision of many different types of data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="international-co-operation"&gt;International co-operation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for Lionel Fewson, Head of Collection, are 5 Collection Officers who could be described as the geographic equivalent of Indiana Jones. They scour the globe in search of useful, creditable data, visiting countries of interest gathering information and making new contacts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making maps from scratch is time consuming and very expensive, so international collaboration and data-sharing is very cost effective. Lionel said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have memorandums of understanding with 50 countries and links with many trusted commercial suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the digital side, the &lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt; is part of a 29-nation programme to capture digital data from various places of interest around the world. In return for their contribution, the &lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt; has access to the entire output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of the benefit of co-operation is the award-winning work producing image-based mapping of compounds in Helmand province to improve battlefield and situational awareness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the US Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, the project has to date captured and referenced more than 200,000 compounds and produced more than 1,100 large-scale maps covering more than 11,000 square kilometres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Defence Geographic Centre personnel" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5849/Research.JPG"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Defence Geographic Centre personnel meet to identify sources for new products [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to future products, there is a revolution taking place, and the &lt;abbr title="Defence Geographic Centre"&gt;DGC&lt;/abbr&gt; is leading the way. The move is towards making more use of human geography in an ordered way. Ian Spencer said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We want to develop standards with our overseas partners to define database structures so that we can start capturing information like ethnicity demographics, economics, religion and water control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you go on the internet you will see lots of people doing things in different disciplines, but at the moment it isn’t connected. We want to pull all this information together in a systematic way so that decision makers and analysts have a better understanding of what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we have the basic geographic foundation we can overlay that with all kinds of human activities. Once data is organised then you can share it and exploit it, and when it has a spatial element you can model these factors and see what effect their interaction has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian believes that marrying physical and social sciences will open up a new world of understanding, as long as you take into account the assumptions and approximations that have been made. Asking how does factor A affect element B is OK as long as you keep an eye out for any more fictitious islands on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <category>Detailed guidance</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Measurement Office (&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;) - previously known as the National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) - regulates the development and use of weighing and measuring equipment to ensure that weights and measures are accurate, fair and legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain and enforce weights and measures regulations, the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; works with local authorities’ trading standards departments and inspectors, local weights and measures authorities and approved verifiers of weights and measures equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s consulting services help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to develop specific measuring products, processes or services. It also helps SMEs to understand the regulations covering their weighing and measuring instruments and how to comply with the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; still provides services under the name of NWML including product certification, quality management systems certification and calibration services to several sectors of industry and local government, all or most of which have some element of weighing or measuring either in their manufacturing processes or in their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; works with WELMEC (the European co-operation in legal metrology) and OIML (the International Organisation of Legal Metrology) to maintain UK consumer and business confidence in legal measurement abroad. It also takes part in preparing OIML recommendations and represents the UK at the OIML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide also outlines the work of the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; Enforcement Authority, the part of the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; responsible for enforcement work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-work-of-the-national-measurement-office"&gt;The work of the National Measurement Office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Measurement Office (&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;) - previously known as the National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) - is an executive agency of the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; is responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;policy on measuring instruments that are used in trade - eg preparing legislation under the Weights and Measures Act 1985 and European Communities Act 1972, and proposals for reforming Weights and Measures Act&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ensuring that the UK implements European directives on measuring instruments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;legal metrology - ie requirements for legal verification of measuring instruments - in the UK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal metrology makes it possible to buy and sell accurate quantities of goods. Without accurate measurements, there would be no possibility of a fair marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; helps ensure the accuracy of the majority of measuring instruments used for trade and pre-packaged goods in the UK - including pre-packaged goods in supermarkets, check-out scales, petrol pumps and beer glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; provides guidance to industry and the public, and enforces UK and European Union weights and measures legislation. Key regulations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Weights and Measures Act 1985 and secondary legislation, including the Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations 2006&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Deregulation (Weights and Measures) Order 1999&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Measuring Instruments Directive 2004/22/EC and the Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments Regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;, the National Measurement System (NMS) unit is responsible for scientific and industrial metrology. Scientific metrology deals with the organisation, development and maintenance of measurement standards. Industrial metrology ensures the adequate functioning of measurement instruments used in industry, production and testing processes. The NMS carries out its tasks in a UK network of measurement laboratories, which include the National Physical Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nmo.bis.gov.uk/content.aspx?SC_ID=484"&gt;Read information on the National Measurement system on the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="nwml-services"&gt;NWML Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NWML Calibration Team, approved under the UK Accreditation Service maintains standards for mass, volume and length measurement. In addition to calibration, NWML provides testing, product and QMS certification services for industry and local authorities - eg local authority Trading Standards. For more information, see the page in this guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-measurement-office"&gt;product certification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also provides a consultancy service to manufacturers that are developing new weighing and measuring equipment. For more information, you can also see the page in this guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-measurement-office"&gt;consultancy and consulting services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses should be aware that NWML Certification Services is changing its name to &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; Certification Services as of 1 April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="nmo-enforcement-authority"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; Enforcement Authority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the role of the National Measurement Office (&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;) has expanded to include the enforcement of regulations aimed at protecting the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; Enforcement Authority, part of the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;, is responsible for enforcing environmental legislation under the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2008 (RoHS Regulations) which limits the levels of certain potentially hazardous substances in new electric and electronic equipment for sale in the European Union (EU). &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/nmo/enforcement/rohs-home"&gt;Find out about RoHS on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; Enforcement Authority also acts as the UK Batteries Regulations enforcement body, to ensure compliance with the Batteries and Accumulators (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2008. This limits the levels of cadmium and mercury in new batteries for sale within the EU, controls the marking of batteries and sets design requirements for battery-operated electrical and electronic equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/nmo/enforcement/batteries-home"&gt;Find out about the Batteries Regulations on the BIS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the Market Surveillance Authority (MSA), under the EU Energy Using Products (EuP) and Energy Labelling Framework (ELF) Directives. This means the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; ensures that manufactures meet their product claims under energy labelling - eg A-rated fridges - and minimum energy standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/nmo/enforcement/ecodesign"&gt;Find out about EuP on the BIS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/nmo/enforcement/elf-home"&gt;Find out about ELF on the Energy Labelling website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="nmo-enforcement-partners"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; enforcement partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; works with various other public and private sector organisations that help to enforce weights and measures regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the local level, the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; works with the Local Government Regulation (formerly the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services), the local government central body responsible for overseeing local authority regulatory and related services in the UK, the Trading Standards Institute and regional groups of local authorities’trading standards departments and inspectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notified bodies are local weights and measurements authorities (LWMA) that assess whether weighing and measuring equipment meets CE marking requirements. CE marking is a manufacturer’s declaration that the product complies with the standards set out in relevant European directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law"&gt;Find a local notified body to evaluate your weighing/measuring equipment with the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approved verifiers have permission from the Secretary of State to test, pass, stamp and verify weighing and measuring equipment that they manufacture, install or repair. Approval may be for non-automatic weighing instruments or for measuring instruments that come under the EU Measuring Instruments Directive. A condition of approval is that the verifier operates an acceptable quality system and receives regular audits and inspections from both the LWMA and the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law"&gt;Apply to become an approved verifer with the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="legal-and-regulatory-activities"&gt;Legal and regulatory activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Measurement Office (&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;) works with trading standards departments in local authorities to deliver enforcement of most of the UK’s weights and measures legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weights and measurements regulations help ensure consumers have accurate information about their purchases. This protects them from being sold short measures. The regulations also protect businesses against dishonest competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/nmo/regulation/weights-and-measures-enforcement/guidance-and-reference-documents/legislation-guidance-notes"&gt;find weights and measures legislation guidance notes on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law"&gt;Search for legislation on weights, measures and hallmarking which may affect your business with the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hallmarking"&gt;Hallmarking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; is responsible for the sponsorship of the British Hallmarking Council. This involves the testing and marking of items of precious metal to indicate they conform to legal standards of purity (fineness), across four assay offices in the UK (London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="water-gas-and-electricity-metering"&gt;Water, gas and electricity metering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; also regulates the metrology of water, gas and electricity meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="better-regulation"&gt;Better regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; complies with Statutory Code of Practice for Regulators (the Regulators’ Compliance Code). This requires regulators to plan regulation and inspections in a way that causes the least disruption to businesses, to impose sanctions and penalties in a transparent and proportionate way and to report annually on their enforcement activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file45019.pdf"&gt;download Regulators’ Compliance Code from the BIS website (PDF, 107K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="consultancy-and-consulting-services"&gt;Consultancy and consulting services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Measurement Office (&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;) offers individually tailored consultancies for UK and international organisations, providing a range of highly skilled engineers and a network of specialist collaborators covering the whole range of legal metrology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It carries out consultations on weights and measures policy and regulatory issues. It has signed up to the government’s Code of Practice on Consultation. This outlines best practice in running public consultation exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file47158.pdf"&gt;download the Code of Practice on Consultation from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS) website (PDF, 223K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nmo.bis.gov.uk/content.aspx?SC_ID=366%20"&gt;find out about previous consultancy projects on the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="measurement-for-innovators-scheme"&gt;Measurement for Innovators scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Measurement for Innovators (MfI) scheme is a BIS programme helping small and medium-sized enterprises to develop and improve new weighing and measuring products, processes and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nmo.bis.gov.uk/content.aspx?SC_ID=495"&gt;Find MfI information on the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="product-certification"&gt;Product certification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the National Measurement Office (&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;), &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; Certification Services provides product certification services to businesses and public sector organisations in the UK and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; Certification Services is a notified body under European directives relating to Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments (NAWI) 2009/23/EC and Measuring Instruments (MID) 2004/22/EC. As a notified body, it can issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European Commission (EC) Type Approval Certificates (TACs) for weighing and measuring instruments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a range of the International Organisation of Legal Metrology (OIML) certificates of conformity - which bring instrument approval in many countries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK National Approvals - under section 12 of the Weights &amp;amp; Measures Act 1985&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s product certificates cover a wide range of weighing and measuring equipment. If you are unsure whether your product will pass the certification process, you can submit your instruments to &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s pre-assessment service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law"&gt;apply for pre-assessment with the online industry service forms from the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out about notified bodies, see the page in this guide on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-measurement-office"&gt;legal and regulatory activities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="nawis"&gt;NAWIs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; can issue European TACs for all electronic and most mechanical NAWIs. These are valid throughout Europe. If you want to sell your NAWI outside Europe, &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; can approve it in accordance with the relevant OIML recommendations. In this case, &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; issues an OIML Certificate of Conformity and test report. These are valid in countries which are signed up to the OIML mutual acceptance arrangements (MAAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to submit your NAWI for &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; certification processes, you will need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fill in an application form - which you can do online&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;forward your supporting documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;send in your equipment for testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To simplify the process, &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; can test separate modules of a NAWI and issue individual Test Certificates (TCs). You can quote these TCs in a TAC. This modular approach is useful for indicators, load cells and point of sale devices, and peripheral devices, such as computers and printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law"&gt;apply for product certification with the online industry service forms from the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring instruments covered by MID include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automatic weighing instruments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fuel dispensers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;material measures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;water meters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a period of 10 years from 30 October 2006, existing European Economic Community and UK National TACs will remain valid for instruments that now come under the MID Directive. You can contact the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; to find out how to convert an existing TAC to an MID approval, as well as applying for approval for a new instrument under MID. However, you should note that the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; is not a notified body for gas and electricity meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="temperature-and-humidity-testing-equipment"&gt;Temperature and humidity testing equipment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; can test and certify temperature testing equipment from 55°C to -25°C, and humidity testing equipment up to 95 per cent relative humidity. You can access the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt;’s environmental test chambers for research or pre-compliance testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uk-national-type-approvals"&gt;UK National Type approvals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All measuring instruments that are used for trade purposes in the UK require a UK National Type Approval certificate. These include measuring instruments for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intoxicating liquor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dynamic axle weighers - automatic vehicle weighbridges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cubic measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can apply to the &lt;abbr title="National Measurement Office"&gt;NMO&lt;/abbr&gt; for product certification or for pre-assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Press Release: Commenting on the latest UCAS 2013 cycle applicant figures</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesperson said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is too early to form a definitive picture about university applications for the 2013/14 academic year. Traditionally fewer than 50 per cent of applicants have submitted their applications by this point in the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students will not pay upfront, there will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments than they do now once they are in well paid jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-for-editors"&gt;Notes for editors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Better choices, better deals</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>A radical new approach to give more power to consumers in their relationships with business.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister Edward Davey has announced today new plans on how businesses will provide key information to their customers on how they use and buy goods and services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help people get the best deal possible, and make business more dynamic in response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new approach is published in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-choices-better-deals-strategy-helping-consumers-make-better-choices"&gt;Better Choices, Better Deals: Consumers Powering Growth&lt;/a&gt; and marks a shift away from legislating to make change happen. Instead it announces new ways to help consumers help themselves and challenges business to innovate, which in turn will drive growth in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="midata"&gt;Midata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the initiative published today will be a project called &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/providing-better-information-and-protection-for-consumers"&gt;midata&lt;/a&gt;, which will assess how to give people their personal data in a format that is safe to pass onto third parties, such as price comparison sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an application or website can pick out the one perfect deal based on your user information, this will help to make consumer choices simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Davey said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an important new initiative that will radically change how consumers relate to business. By giving you more power in your relationship with businesses you will be better placed to get the deal you want, and that deal may put a bit of money back in your pocket.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will in turn reward the most competitive and innovative businesses.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-people-are-saying-about-better-choices-better-deals"&gt;What people are saying about ‘Better Choices: Better Deals’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Professor Nigel Shadbolt, Chair of Midata: **   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Information about how we shop, travel, communicate and live our lives is a powerful source of insight, so it’s important that each of us should be able to access our own data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very much looking forward to chairing the mydata group, which aims to make accessing this data much simpler, and should be a watershed on how we use data to get a better deal every day.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice Chief Executive: **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Citizens Advice is an active champion for consumers. We help people get a better deal and make it simpler and easier to get information and advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are thrilled to be part of this new consumer empowerment strategy alongside Citizens Advice Scotland and Consumer Focus.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In particular we are really pleased to see recognition that in new technology is not good news for everyone. Some vulnerable groups can be excluded from best value deals and methods of redress.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our experience helping over 2 million clients a year shows that consumers have many varied needs. We look forward to helping ensure that provision for consumers really is inclusive and services and products are equally available to all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christine Farnish, Chair of Consumer Focus, said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It’s good news that government is looking at how more powerful consumers can create more effective markets and public services. While there are companies who want to provide better value and service, the truth is that if you don’t have demanding consumers, then you won’t have responsive markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A challenge for the government strategy is how it removes the barriers and opens the field for consumers to take action. This also needs to go hand in hand with making the most effective use of regulation and tackling the wider problems exhibited by consumer markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since its creation Consumer Focus has campaigned for better customer information and complaints handling. Increasingly we have been pushing new ways to unlock the ability of consumers to band together and either discipline poor companies or reward good ones. The opportunity for coordinated consumer action through online and social media is growing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The success of this approach will depend on whether it really helps consumers to mobilise their market power by coming together and showing companies the benefits of providing the value and customer service that people want.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Richard Thaler, co-author of Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness: &lt;br&gt;
** &lt;br&gt;
“This is a very exciting initiative that shows how modern technology can create entirely new ways of thinking about the government’s role in business regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is of course true that we cannot replace all laws and regulations with nudges. However, this approach will give honest, high quality firms an edge in their battle with competitors who use obfuscation as their chief marketing strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Simple electronic disclosure is not costly for large firms to provide, and can provide enormous benefits to consumers. Eventually, this approach has the potential for replacing much more intrusive and burdensome regulations that firms inevitably find ways to evade.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the growing interest in collective purchasing, from both government and from consumers. We are pleased to be working with BIS to launch the Innovation Prize. The best way to empower consumers is to enable them to come together co-operatively.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Wermann, Director of Corporate Affairs - Home Retail Group, Argos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Argos always puts the customer first. Being at the forefront of multi-channel retailing in the UK we believe any successful retailer will need to evolve their product range, services and accessibility to ensure the customers get the best choice and value most suited to their needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government’s consumer empowerment programme is a great way to enable this to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Chan, CEO, Barclaycard Consumer Europe:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Barclaycard believes that digital technology - through simple online tools such as mybarclaycard, its award winning online servicing site which enables customers to analyse their spending, has the potential to really empower consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just imagine if people could easily access and review all their financial transaction data from all their banks, in one place, using simple web-based tools. We believe that could make a real difference to people, and that’s why we support mydata.”   &lt;/p&gt;
