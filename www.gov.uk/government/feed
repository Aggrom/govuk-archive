    <title>Improving the quality of further education and skills training</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further education (&lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt;) system – the colleges and training providers that teach vocational qualifications and skills – needs to guarantee students high quality teaching and courses to help students into jobs or university and create the skilled workforce employers need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve quality and efficiency in &lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt; and skills training, the government is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introducing a new funding system based on student loans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;freeing colleges from central government control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improving apprenticeships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making &lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt; teacher training more professional&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;providing better careers advice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for funding post-16 learning in England is shared between the Department for Education (16-18 year olds) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (19 year olds and over).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2011, an independent review of further education, &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/The%20Wolf%20Report.pdf"&gt;the Review of Vocational Education&lt;/a&gt; made a number of recommendations including that we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move to ‘per-student’ funding instead of ‘per-qualification’ funding, to make institutions more accountable to learners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve the quality of apprenticeships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government then carried out a public consultation to invite opinions on these recommendations &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-challenges-new-chances-next-steps-in-implementing-the-further-education-reform-programme"&gt;New challenges, new chances: next steps in implementing the further education reform programme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the responses to the consultation, the government published its plans, in December 2011, for the &lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt; sector in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-investment-statement-for-2011-to-2014-new-challenges-new-chances" title="New challenges, new chances: further education system and skills reform plan"&gt;New challenges, new chances: further education system and skills reform plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will shortly publish an update on ‘New challenges, new chances’. This will explain the progress we have made in reforming the further education and skills system. We have already published a number of reports and plans on aspects of the system, including: &lt;/p&gt;

It means that &lt;abbr title="Further education"&gt;FE&lt;/abbr&gt; colleges can now borrow money without needing permission from the government. Colleges can also change the way they govern themselves, and those rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted no longer have to face routine inspections. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The National Careers Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s vision for a better quality of information, advice and guidance on learning and work is set out in the document &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-careers-service-the-right-advice-at-the-right-time"&gt;The Right Advice at the Right Time&lt;/a&gt; , published in April 2012, the month the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121205150610/http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/further-education-skills/national-careers-service-for-england"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/a&gt; was launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strand Leader: David Mc Nerney in association with Ruth Spellman, OBE, Rajay Naik and Steve Higginbotham.&lt;/p&gt;

This was followed by meetings on 12 June 2012 and 24 September 2012 with John Hayes, MP, then Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning (jointly with the Department for Education) and government policy-makers, to discuss and agree the proposed Council work strands for 2012-2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="evidence-to-lord-heseltine-review"&gt;Evidence to Lord Heseltine Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 30 August 2012 members of the NCC met with the Lord Heseltine Review team of how spending departments and other relevant public sector bodies interact with the private sector, and to assess their capacity to deliver pro-growth policies. The meeting covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raising the work-readiness of school leavers and those acquiring tertiary qualifications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remedying skills deficiencies in the current workforce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;addressing the longstanding NEETs problem and encouraging apprenticeships and support for the lower skilled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the written evidence submitted to Lord Heseltine’s Review can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ncc-workplan"&gt;NCC Workplan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Careers Council is currently auditing key policy themes and has identified seven major challenges that will inform its ongoing work. A workplan, formally presented to the minister on 2 July 2012, sets out key priorities and plans for 2012 to 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further update will be produced in September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="next-stage-plans"&gt;Next stage plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two Council meetings are scheduled to be held on 14 January 2013 and 18 April 2013. Dr Hughes will be meeting with interested parties to find ways of connecting organisations and individuals to feed into the Council’s work. The Council will develop a more detailed work plan for each of the three work strands and look at ways to involve others in its work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Louise Casey calls for family intervention approach</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a look at the academic evidence, alongside consultation with practitioners and families themselves, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/louise-casey"&gt;Louise Casey&lt;/a&gt; today published a new report that shows the life-changing results that good family intervention can have on even the most challenging households, along with a guide to best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-with-troubled-families-a-guide-to-evidence-and-good-practice"&gt;‘Working with Troubled Families’ report&lt;/a&gt; outlines that family intervention reduces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;involvement in anti-social behaviour by 59%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;involvement in crime by 45%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;truancy, exclusion, bad behaviour at school by 52%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also points to the 5 key features of effective family intervention being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dedicated worker, dedicated to a family&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;practical ‘hands on’ support &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a persistent, assertive and challenging approach &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;considering the family as a whole - gathering the intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;common purpose and agreed action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise Casey is now calling on councils to review their own ways of working with troubled families and adopt these principles in order to ensure that the significant momentum that has built up behind the programme - with all eligible local authorities in England on board and committed to working with over 40,000 families in this financial year - continues in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to push on with this work and make further progress towards the Prime Minister’s pledge to turn around the lives of 120,000 troubled families by 2015, the Department for Communities and Local Government will also be holding a series of training academies for local authorities in the new year to help share best practice on family intervention and provide masterclasses from some of its leading exponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head of the government’s Troubled Families programme Louise Casey said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My last report was about listening to troubled families themselves and some of the stories from families were truly appalling. However these were families successfully going through family intervention and the results were impressive - so I wanted to ensure that this practice is adopted as widely as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This report makes a strong case about what works - family intervention that involves one dedicated worker for each family, providing tough but persistent challenge and support, has a dramatic impact, not just on the life chances of those within the families, but on the communities around them who suffer from the effects of truancy, youth crime and anti-social behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This important piece of work is a crucial step towards building a wide campaign of support behind the work we are doing to break an inter-generational cycle of misery and failure with these families. It will put rocket boosters under the Prime Minister’s pledge to turn around 120,000 troubled families by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Effective family intervention also demonstrates that savings can be made for taxpayers by putting families back on the right track for the long run, rather than wasting money on simply reacting to their problems. We must have aspiration for every family and this work will reach all corners of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dame Clare Tickell, Chief Executive of Action for Children, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since developing the initial model, we’ve seen how family intervention can really help vulnerable families facing multiple difficulties in their lives. It works by forming effective relationships with families and building on their strengths. This timely guide is a welcome resource, which will help people understand the key features of the model, learn what really works and ensure that projects are delivered to a high quality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All eligible local authorities are running troubled families programmes in their area and between them have committed to start work with 41,835 families across England by the end of this financial year, over a third of the 120,000 the Prime Minister wants to see turned around by the end of this parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government is today also publishing management information on the work of family intervention projects and services in England up to 31 March 2012. This reports the latest data at a national level for all participating family intervention services. It includes information on the families worked with and the percentage of families considered to have a successful outcome in relation to family functioning and risk, crime/ anti-social behaviour, health and education/ employment. This data was collected by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) which ran a secure web-based information system into which family intervention project staff recorded details of the families they worked with between 2007-2012. It can be found at Annex B of the ‘Working With Troubled Families’ report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Plant Breeders' Rights</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved plant varieties and good quality seeds are essential for safe, reliable and efficient crop and food production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an incentive for plant breeding, breeders of any species of plant - whether agricultural, horticultural or ornamental - can apply for Plant Breeders’ Rights (&lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt;). These give the breeder legal rights in the UK over the varieties they have developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Plant Variety Rights Office, which is part of the Food and Environment Research Agency, administers PBRs in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, plant breeders can make a single application for protection throughout the 27 member states of the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; to the Community Plant Variety Office, which has offices in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-are-plant-breeders-rights"&gt;What are Plant Breeders’ Rights?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; in the UK are administered through the Plant Varieties Act 1997. They give breeders legal rights over any new varieties of plants they have developed and allow them to charge royalties for using these ‘protected’ varieties. This provides a means for breeding companies to fund their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hold &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; this will mean that no-one else, unless specifically authorised, can use your plant species for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production or reproduction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;selling or offering for sale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conditioning for the purpose of propagation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exporting or importing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stocking for any of the above purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These rights only apply if the plants are being used for commercial purposes - they do not apply to any act done for private and non-commercial purposes, for experimental purposes or for the purpose of breeding another variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All applications and enquiries should be made to the Plant Variety Rights Office (&lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt;) at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whitehouse Lane&lt;br&gt;
Huntingdon Road&lt;br&gt;
Cambridge&lt;br&gt;
CB3 OLF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also call the &lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt; helpline on 01223 342 379, or email them at &lt;a href="mailto:pvs.helpdesk@fera.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;pvs.helpdesk@fera.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; is valid for 25 years, except for trees, vines or potato varieties which will be protected for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may give up your rights at any time and rights may be terminated if the variety no longer fulfils its criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-rights-are-there-for-dependent-varieties"&gt;What rights are there for dependent varieties?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also have &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; in respect of any variety which is ‘dependent on’ your protected variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies to varieties that require the repeated use of your protected variety (such as hybrids), or those which are ‘essentially derived’ from it - meaning that they were bred from it and retain its fundamental characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="application-procedure-and-fees"&gt;Application procedure and fees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When making an application for &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; you must submit the following to the Plant Variety Rights Office:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an application form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a completed technical questionnaire for the correct species of the plant variety&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for ornamental species - a colour photograph of the representative features of the variety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All applications and documents must be in English or have an English translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When making payments you must also submit an RAS 1 or RAS 2 form which must be sent to &lt;abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency"&gt;Fera&lt;/abbr&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency"&gt;Fera&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sand Hutton&lt;br&gt;
York&lt;br&gt;
YO41 1LZ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can contact the &lt;abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency"&gt;Fera&lt;/abbr&gt; helpline on 01904 462 000, or fax them on 01904 462111.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/feesForms/plantBreedersRights.cfm"&gt;find all the forms and questionnaires on the &lt;abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency"&gt;Fera&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fees"&gt;Fees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must pay an administration fee for each application made. Additionally, other fees payable may include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a ‘distinct, uniform and stable’ (&lt;abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable"&gt;DUS&lt;/abbr&gt;) test fee and a reference variety fee, both payable for each year of testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the purchase price of a testing report from another country, when the report is available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For details of the current application fees, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantVarieties/nationalListing/documents/fees2011.pdf"&gt;download a table of fees for National Listing (PDF, 34K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-applications-are-processed"&gt;How applications are processed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The candidate variety will be &lt;abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable"&gt;DUS&lt;/abbr&gt; tested and considered by experts to check whether all the requirements have been met. Proposed decisions will be announced through the UK National Lists and Seeds Committee on behalf of the Controller of Plant Variety Rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcements of a proposal to grant rights will be published in the Plant Varieties and Seeds Gazette. The announcement gives any person who can show that he or she has an interest in the decision the right to make written representations or to request a hearing in person against the proposed decision. A period of 18 days is normally allowed for such purposes. If none are received and providing all information has been submitted and fees paid a UK Grant of Rights will be issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; will be enforceable at any point after it is granted. However, you are entitled to reasonable compensation if your rights are infringed at any time after receipt of the application has been published in the Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-can-apply-for-plant-breeders-rights"&gt;Who can apply for Plant Breeders’ Rights?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can apply for &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; if you have bred, discovered or developed the plant variety in question, or if you have been designated by the breeder as the successor in title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you have bred, discovered or developed the plant as part of your normal employment, your employer is entitled to the rights and you are not - unless you have an agreement in place that allows you to apply for &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; in your name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="agents"&gt;Agents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; can be applied for either in person or through an agent. Applicants from outside the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; must give an address for an agent within the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt;. If you decide to use an agent you must give the &lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt; written authorisation for the agent to act on your behalf. Likewise, if you are acting as an agent the breeder must give written proof that you are allowed to act for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/forms/documents/DEF-PVS11-FERA-0709.pdf"&gt;download an authorisation of agent form from the &lt;abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency"&gt;Fera&lt;/abbr&gt; website (PDF, 519K)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If as a breeder you apply for your &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; through an agent you should be aware that all correspondence and requests for fees from &lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt; will be sent to the agent. This means that although you hold the rights you will not receive any correspondence directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you act as an agent it is your responsibility to process any correspondence from &lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt; and do all that is necessary to obtain and maintain the rights such as paying fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="criteria-for-a-plant-variety-to-obtain-plant-breeders-rights"&gt;Criteria for a plant variety to obtain Plant Breeders’ Rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have applied for &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt;, the Plant Variety Rights Office will ask you to send them material of the plant variety for distinctness, uniformity and stability (&lt;abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable"&gt;DUS&lt;/abbr&gt;) testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="distinctness"&gt;Distinctness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety must have one or more major characteristics, which can be precisely described, that makes it different from any other variety ‘in common knowledge’. A variety is said to be ‘in common knowledge’ if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is, or has been, the subject of &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; in any country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is, or has been, entered in an official register of plant varieties in any country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an application for &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; or entry in an official register is under consideration in any country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A variety may also be in common knowledge if it is already in cultivation, has been exploited for commercial purposes, is held in a recognised reference collection or has a precise description in any publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uniformity"&gt;Uniformity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety must be sufficiently uniform in the characteristics which make it distinct, subject to normal and expected variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="stability"&gt;Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify for stability, the plant characteristics which make it distinct must remain unchanged after repeated propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="novelty"&gt;Novelty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety is said to be new if it has not been sold or otherwise exploited with the consent of the applicant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the UK, earlier than one year before the date of application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;outside the UK, earlier than four years (six years in the case of trees or vines) before the date of application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="testing-organisations"&gt;Testing organisations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing is carried out by approved organisations. They include the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in England and Wales, Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture and the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some species, testing is carried out by testing authorities in other European member states under bi-lateral agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-long-do-the-tests-take"&gt;How long do the tests take?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually &lt;abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable"&gt;DUS&lt;/abbr&gt; testing of ornamentals takes one year, herbage varieties four years, trees three years, and other species two years. This is just a guideline and may vary if there is difficulty in establishing distinctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hybrid varieties tests may also need to be conducted on the parental lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantVarieties/nationalListing/dusTestingRequirements.cfm"&gt;Find information on the protocols for &lt;abbr title="Distinct, Uniform and Stable"&gt;DUS&lt;/abbr&gt; testing of specific plant species on the &lt;abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency"&gt;Fera&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="community-plant-variety-rights"&gt;Community Plant Variety Rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to have protection for your plant variety throughout the &lt;abbr title="European Union"&gt;EU&lt;/abbr&gt; you can apply to the Community Plant Variety Office (&lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office"&gt;CPVO&lt;/abbr&gt;) for Community Plant Variety Rights (&lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cpvo.europa.eu/main/en/home/filing-an-application/online-forms"&gt;find online application forms and technical questionnaires on the &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office"&gt;CPVO&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offices of the &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office"&gt;CPVO&lt;/abbr&gt; are located in France:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office"&gt;CPVO&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;

B.P. 10121&lt;br&gt;
FR - 49101 Angers Cedex 02&lt;br&gt;
France&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also call the &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office"&gt;CPVO&lt;/abbr&gt; helpline on +33 241 25 64 00 or e-mail them at &lt;a href="mailto:cpvo@cpvo.europa.eu"&gt;cpvo@cpvo.europa.eu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure for applying for &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt; is very similar to the procedure for applying for UK &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt;). You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cpvo.europa.eu/main/en"&gt;find guidance on all aspects of &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt; and which forms and fees to submit on the &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Office"&gt;CPVO&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt;, once &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt; is granted it is valid for a maximum duration of 25 years, or 30 years for vine, trees and potatoes, provided that the annual fees are paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cpvrand-pbr"&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt; and UK &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; are separate and you cannot hold both simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt; is granted for a variety which already has a national &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt;, the national rights are suspended for the duration of the &lt;abbr title="Community Plant Variety Rights"&gt;CPVR&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="royalty-payments-on-farm-saved-seed"&gt;Royalty payments on farm-saved seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holders of &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; are entitled to charge farmers if they use farm-saved seed (seed that they have harvested from crops they have grown themselves) of the protected variety. This applies to plant varieties of the following species:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cereals - oats, barley, rice, canary grass, rye, triticale, wheat, durum wheat and spelt wheat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fodder plants - chickpea milkvetch, yellow lupin, lucerne, field pea, berseem/Egyptian clover, Persian clover, field bean and common vetch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil and fibre plants - swede rape, turnip rape and linseed - with the exclusion of flax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers who use farm-saved seed should pay you a fair fee - which should be sensibly lower than the royalty charged on the sales of certified seed. Farmers are required by law to declare their use of farm-saved seed (&lt;abbr title="Farm-saved Seed"&gt;FSS&lt;/abbr&gt;) of eligible varieties to the British Society of Plant Breeders (&lt;abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders"&gt;BSPB&lt;/abbr&gt;), which is responsible for collecting &lt;abbr title="Farm-saved Seed"&gt;FSS&lt;/abbr&gt; payments. You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://returns.bspb.co.uk/"&gt;make your &lt;abbr title="Farm-saved Seed"&gt;FSS&lt;/abbr&gt; Declaration and arrange payment of royalties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can contact them at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also call the &lt;abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders"&gt;BSPB&lt;/abbr&gt; helpline on 01353 653 200 or email them at &lt;a href="mailto:enquiries@bspb.co.uk"&gt;enquiries@bspb.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bspb.co.uk/fssd/introduction.html"&gt;find out about farm-saved seed payments on the &lt;abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders"&gt;BSPB&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="apply-for-a-compulsory-licence"&gt;Apply for a compulsory licence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a two-year period after &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; are granted, the &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; holder is free to decide who they will grant licences to, and any other terms and conditions. After this time, compulsory licences may be granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any person who has applied for a licence to use a protected species and feels that the &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt; holder has unreasonably refused to grant the licence or has imposed unreasonable terms, can apply for a compulsory licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compulsory licence applications are made to the &lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt;. A compulsory licence will not be granted by the Controller of Plant Variety Rights unless he is satisfied that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a licence is necessary to ensure the variety is available to the public at a reasonable price, is widely distributed, or quality is maintained&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the applicant is in a position to - and intends to - exploit the variety in a professional way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-effect-of-a-compulsory-licence"&gt;What is the effect of a compulsory licence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Controller may grant any licence that might have been granted by the holder of the &lt;abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights"&gt;PBR&lt;/abbr&gt;. The Controller can also extend, limit, vary or revoke a compulsory licence and impose terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-to-apply-for-a-compulsory-licence"&gt;How to apply for a compulsory licence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get an application form from the &lt;abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office"&gt;PVRO&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Small businesses to benefit from £1.1 million innovation boost</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation is vital for business growth. The aim is simple – to accelerate economic growth by stimulating and supporting business-led innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £2 million fund has been created for the Innovation Vouchers scheme, running over the next three years. The vouchers provide £5000 for a UK start-up, micro, small or medium-sized businesses to work with external experts and gain new knowledge to help their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £1.1 million announced today is for companies who want to use public open data to commercialise their ideas and develop products and prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open data business innovator or inventors could use an Innovation Voucher by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow ing services and solutions using open data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developing an idea into a working prototype&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrating open data with other data sources to develop products and prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeking Intellectual Property advice in respect of ideas incorporating open data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme is already open to businesses who want to develop ideas relating to the Agri-food, Built Environment, Space industries, Energy, Water and Waste sectors, with a hundred vouchers allocated every three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures from round one show that over 200 projects were successful in the draw for Innovation Vouchers for Agri-Food, Built Environment and Space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This new wave of Innovation Vouchers will give SMEs a great opportunity to bid for funding that can make a real difference to the growth of their business ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They will be able to develop exciting proposals that can make use of open data, which have the potential to unlock great value and boost economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="innovation-vouchers"&gt;Innovation Vouchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will be able to apply for the Innovation Vouchers directly through the &lt;a rel="external" href="https://vouchers.innovateuk.org/"&gt;Technology Strategy Board&lt;/a&gt; and the Open Data Institute (ODI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business can use their Innovation Vouchers to work with knowledge suppliers such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universities and further education colleges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research and technology organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical consultancies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catapult centres&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design advisers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intellectual property advisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional funding for open data vouchers comes after BIS announced this week new measures &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-funding-to-accelerate-benefits-of-open-data-684c1.aspx"&gt;to open up access to public data&lt;/a&gt;, including a new £7.5 million Data Strategy Board Breakthrough Fund and a new £850,000 open data Immersion Programme which will assist public organisations and companies in opening up new opportunities for data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making the labour market more flexible, efficient and fair</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="issue"&gt;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses say current employment laws are difficult to cope with and put them off taking on staff. This slows the growth of businesses and the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simpler, more flexible employment laws will make it easier for companies to hire and manage staff, while protecting basic workers’ rights. This should encourage employers to create new jobs, supporting enterprise and growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the labour market more flexible, efficient and fair the government is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed to review employment law in May 2010 as part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/coalition-agreement-may-2010_0.pdf" title="Coalition Agreement"&gt;Coalition Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extended the time you need to be employed to be able to claim for unfair dismissal from 1 to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enterprise-and-regulatory-reform-bill-policy-paper" title="Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill"&gt;Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill&lt;/a&gt; which will make changes to the employment tribunal system, including ensuring all employment tribunal claims go to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461" title="Acas"&gt;Acas&lt;/a&gt; and introducing a simpler process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;removed the compulsory retirement age, making it easier for older people to carry on working&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launched a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Regional-Mediation-Pilot-Schemes-up-and-running-67b90.aspx"&gt;pilot scheme&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the use of mediation to resolve disputes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reviewed how employment rights are enforced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-we-are-consulting"&gt;Who we are consulting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve carried out consultations on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>This week at the Foreign Office </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h4 id="syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary outlined the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-remarks-at-the-friends-of-syria-meeting" title="Foreign Secretary remarks at Friends of the Syrian People meeting"&gt;immediate priorities for the Friends of the Syrian People&lt;/a&gt; at the meeting in Marrakesh this week. He said “Syria needs a political transition leading to an inclusive new government, with full executive authority. This is the course most likely to achieve stability in the country.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="international-human-rights-day"&gt;International Human Rights Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On International Human Rights Day Baroness Warsi launched the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-baroness-warsi-marks-human-rights-day" title="Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi marks Human Rights Day"&gt;UK’s campaign for election to the Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;. She said: “We believe in a Human Rights Council that can make its voice heard, even when the issues are unpopular or difficult to hear.” The Foreign Office marked &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/" title="16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence"&gt;16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&lt;/a&gt; ending on Monday with a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/post/37632415718/helen-pankhurst" title="guest post"&gt;guest post from Dr. Helen Pankhurst&lt;/a&gt; from CARE international. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="foreign-office-website-moves-to-govuk"&gt;Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-website-moves-to-gov-uk" title="Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK"&gt;Foreign Office began publishing its news&lt;/a&gt;, speeches, policy, publications and corporate information on GOV.UK – the single home for all government services and information. Our travel advice and consular information, and our Embassy and High Commission websites will follow by March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-condemns-dprk-s-satellite-launch" title="Foreign Secretary condemns DPRK’s satellite launch"&gt;condemned the DPRK’s satellite launch&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday saying that the launch was a clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 because it involved the testing of ballistic missile technology. The Permanent Under Secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/north-korean-ambassador-summoned-to-foreign-and-commonwealth-office" title="DPRK Ambassador summoned"&gt;summoned the DPRK’s Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in London to the Foreign Office to make clear to the UK’s condemnation of the DPRK’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="parental-child-abduction"&gt;Parental Child Abduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New figures revealed that the number of parental child abduction cases dealt with by the Foreign Office has risen by 88% in under a decade.
