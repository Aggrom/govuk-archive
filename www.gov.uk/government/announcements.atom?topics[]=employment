    <title>Reform of flexible parental leave</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 Nov 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has announced reforms that will allow parents to share up to a year’s leave after the birth of a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government plans to legislate on this next year, and will introduce the changes to flexible working in 2014 and to flexible parental leave in 2015. Under the new system, parents will be able to choose how they share the care of their child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employed mothers will still be entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave. However, working parents will have much greater flexibility about how they ‘mix and match’ their leave. They may take it in turns or take it together, providing it is not more than 52 weeks in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="greater-choice"&gt;Greater choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mothers will have to take at least the initial two weeks of leave after birth as a recovery period, but can then choose to end the maternity leave and the parents can opt to share the remaining leave. It will be up to both parents to decide how they share the remaining weeks. Nick Clegg welcomed the announcement, saying;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Reform is long overdue and the changes we are making will shatter the perception that women have to be the primary care-givers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the future, both mothers and fathers will be able to take control of how they balance those precious first months with their child and their careers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is good news not only for parents and parents-to-be, but employers too who will benefit from a much more flexible and motivated workforce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="engaged-employees"&gt;Engaged employees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers will benefit from being able to make the most of the entire talent pool that the increased flexibility allows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Employment Relations, Jo Swinson, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we are to deliver sustainable, strong growth we need to get the best out of both men and women in the workforce.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Current arrangements are old-fashioned, inflexible and gender-biased. People should have the right to choose how they balance their work and family commitments.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These proposals bring good news for business - not least a more motivated and productive workforce. Employers will be able to recruit and retain staff from a wider pool of talent in turn helping to diversify our economy and drive growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Extending the right to request flexible working will enable all employees to discuss flexible working with their employer, and move the discussion away from why the employee needs to work flexibly, and onto how flexible working will work for the business.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regional Growth Fund projects selected</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 Oct 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has announced how the Regional Growth Fund will create or safeguard thousands of jobs over the long term, benefitting 130 projects and leveraging £6 billion of private sector investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment will help manufacturing firms, small businesses and local partnerships across England to expand their operations, create new jobs and stimulate growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/regional-growth-fund"&gt;Full list of the round three selected bidders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This £1 billion boost for growth in towns and cities across England is creating jobs that will last in the parts of the country that need it most.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have seen for myself the real difference this makes on the ground - from iconic businesses like Eddie Stobart expanding in Widnes and creating 3,450 jobs in the local area, to the Sunderland car parts factory, Unipres who have used their funding to buy a new 3,000 tonne press, letting them accelerate production and take on an extra 316 people.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around £697 million of the £1.05 billion pot will go to over 100 companies in the private sector, with a further £358 million going to local authorities and local enterprise partnerships (LEPs), ensuring that funding gets to the right parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="boosting-local-growth"&gt;Boosting local growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Business Secretary, Vince Cable visited &lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Vince-Cable-delivers-funding-boost-for-Liverpool-pharma-company-681da.aspx"&gt;Redx Pharma in Liverpool yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based pharmaceutical company which has been allocated £4.7 million in round 3 for research into drugs against microbial infection, influenza, hepatitis C and HIV. The project is expected to create 119 jobs over five years. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Regional Growth Fund is creating the long-term growth and jobs that this country needs. The projects support important local priorities and there is a good alignment with key sectors in our Industrial Strategy including automotive, aerospace and life sciences.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Redx Pharma’s previous award of £5.6 million in round two has already helped them establish an impressive oncology research centre and has created over 50 new jobs since April this year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon visited Rochdale, and a manufacturing company with a 150 year history. Thanks to money from the Regional Growth Fund they will be building a new European headquarters in the area. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Holroyd Precision is a prime example of how we can help companies achieve their aspirations and create jobs in a timescale that works for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The company will maintain its strong links with Rochdale thanks to the Regional Growth Fund and build its new European headquarters in the area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So not only are they staying here in the North West, but they are expanding and creating new jobs. Success stories like this are happening up and down the country thanks to the Regional Growth Fund.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employee owner plans to boost growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 Oct 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a package to support growth, a consultation has been published today. It sets out plans for a new employment status called an ‘employee owner’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give workers a financial stake in their firm’s growth and success through tax-free shares.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move follows the Chancellor’s announcement on 8 October and will provide companies with a new option to increase the flexibility of how they hire people and help their companies grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new employment status, employee owners will have a different set of employment rights and they will be given shares in the company of between £2,000 and £50,000. Any increase in value of these shares will not be subject to capital gains tax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister, Jo Swinson, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know that engaged employees are more productive and motivated. This scheme increases the options for business and brings greater flexibility to companies and employees in determining their employment relationship.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By responding to the flexible needs of fast growing companies, it will help them take people on, providing a real incentive for employers and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/consultation-on-implementing-employee-owner-status?cat=open"&gt;Find out more about the proposals and have the chance to submit your views on the consultation&lt;/a&gt;. It will close on 8 November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="employee-owners"&gt;Employee Owners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees taken on this way will have all of the rights associated with other employees except for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfair dismissal rights (apart from automatically unfair reasons and where dismissal is based on discriminatory grounds). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rights to redundancy pay. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certain statutory rights to request training. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The statutory right to request flexible working. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee owners will have to give more notice to if they want to return from maternity or adoption leave early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be entirely voluntary for the employer to offer the new status - and for an individual to choose to accept it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An employer will be able to choose the new status and still choose to offer more rights to their staff (e.g. the right to request flexible working or higher levels of contractual redundancy pay).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies of any size will be able to use this new kind of contract, but it is intended for fast growing small and medium sized companies that would benefit most from a flexible workforce.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation sets out the proposal in detail and asks for views on how the government can implement it. This consultation is focused on both employment law and company law issues. The Treasury will be consulting on the tax matters separately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation to bring in the new employee owner contract will be introduced today via the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, with the aim of companies being able to offer the new type of contract from April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New proposals to streamline employment law</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;14 Sep 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s package comes in response to calls from business to simplify and speed up the process of ending the employment relationship when it breaks down, for the benefit of both employers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has given details of: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its support for settlement agreements to help end employment relationships in a fair and consensual way. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consultation on how best to make this work in practice starts today and Acas has agreed to provide a new code of practice. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How it might reduce the cap on compensation for unfair dismissal claims. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposals to streamline employment tribunals by making it easier for judges to dismiss weak cases &lt;br&gt;
responses to its call for evidence on the TUPE rules, when staff transfer to a new employer. Government has heard that businesses want this to be more efficient, and will consult on specific proposals before the end of the year. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendations on how to improve guidance for small businesses on the Acas code of practice on discipline and grievance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have been looking across the range of employment laws with a view to making it easier for firms to hire staff while protecting basic labour rights.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our starting point is that Britain already has very flexible labour markets. That is why well over one million new private sector jobs have been created in the last two years, even when the economy has been flatlining.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we acknowledge that more can be done to help small companies by reducing the burden of employment tribunals, which we are reforming, and moving to less confrontational dispute resolutions through settlement agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/d/12-1143-dismissal-for-micro-businesses-response.pdf"&gt;responded formally to the call for evidence on proposals for compensated no fault dismissal for micro-firms.&lt;/a&gt; Based on the evidence presented by business the Government will not be taking forward the proposal.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a lightly regulated, flexible labour market that the OECD considers to be amongst the best in the world, behind only USA and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report cited the flexibility of the UK’s labour market as one of the main reasons for its improvement in the global rankings to 8th from 10th.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Government has committed to look at ways to make it more responsive to businesses through a parliament long review of employment law, in conjunction with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; on employment law, with the aim of clearing away unnecessary and complex regulation that has damaged flexibility, created perverse incentives, increased business risk and unnecessary administration. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Future of Employment Law</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for asking me to speak today. I’m sorry I can’t be with you in person, but the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill is currently passing through Parliament and I have to be at today’s Committee session to debate the Government’s plans for reforming employment law.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to begin by paying tribute to the fantastic work the CIPD does to foster high standards in HR management. In a former life I was an employment lawyer and I spent a lot of time working with excellent HR professionals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you don’t always get the recognition you deserve, but your work helps to underpin the success of the UK economy in a very real sense. Investing the time and effort that’s required to nurture positive relationships between employers and employees - as all of you do every day - generates real benefits for a company’s bottom line.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis by Aon Hewitt, for example, found that organisations with employee engagement levels above 65% outperformed the total stock market index, and posted total shareholder returns around 22% above average. This indicates that companies which recruit well, treat people properly and invest in developing their employees’ skills will reap the rewards of greater productivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="government-reforms"&gt;Government reforms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Government has an important role to play, too, in ensuring that the UK’s employment law regime operates as flexibly and as effectively as possible. That’s why we are introducing a series of reforms, which safeguard workers’ rights while streamlining the system to reduce the sometimes onerous and unnecessary demands made on employers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexible labour markets are a critical part of a successful economy. It’s essential they function in a way that gives employers the confidence to create new jobs, so people out of work can get that vital first foot in the door.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the framework we inherited contains perverse incentives that can dissuade responsible employers from hiring new staff for fear of the costs and time incurred if it doesn’t work out.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to overstate the problem - according to the OECD, the UK labour market is among the most flexible in the world - but we can’t afford to be complacent, and where we can make it better we should.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller businesses, in particular, have told us the fear of ending up in an employment tribunal is a real disincentive to hiring new staff. The decision to expand is one of the most important steps a growing business ever takes, so if we are serious about job creation we have to strike the right balance between security for the worker and flexibility for the employer.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we have doubled the period of time a staff member must have been in post before they can claim unfair dismissal, from one year to two. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="encouraging-recruitment"&gt;Encouraging recruitment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, we have to ensure that all parties have accurate information about their current rights and responsibilities. No employer should be put off recruiting new staff because of misconceptions about the obligations they would be taking on.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason we launched the Employer’s Charter, a simple one-page document that sets out for employers the rights and options they have for dealing with various staff management issues.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also launched an online toolkit for first-time employers which provides a guide to their obligations. It includes information on setting pay, getting the right insurance, understanding tax requirements, and checking a new employee’s right to work in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ending-the-employment-relationship"&gt;Ending the employment relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that the vast majority of businesses treat their staff with respect - it is in their commercial interests to have motivated staff and a culture of mutual respect in the workplace.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, however, there will be times when it becomes clear a member of staff is not right for their role. And in those circumstances we want to reduce the number of disputes that go to an employment tribunal each year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be aware that the Government launched a call for evidence on the concept of compensated no-fault dismissal for micro businesses. The CIPD responded to this call, and was by no means alone in highlighting the problems associated with such an approach. We are currently analysing the evidence to see if there might be a case for change, but I have to say I am not persuaded of its merits.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, tribunals are a costly, stressful and time-consuming process for everyone involved. So we are encouraging greater use of mediation as a means of resolving disputes.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are setting up two mediation networks in pilot form to explore the potential benefits of this approach. And, in future, all prospective claimants will have to contact Acas before they can lodge a tribunal claim, thereby maximising the chances of an early and agreed solution. The aim is to preserve the employment relationship, wherever possible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where relations have broken down, we want to enable all parties to reach an agreed solution, at an earlier stage. Settlement Agreements will allow for no-fault arrangements without the fear that the deal, or the discussions around it, can subsequently be used as evidence of unfair dismissal in a tribunal claim.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will provide employers with model letters, templates and guidance enshrined in a Statutory Code of Practice to encourage the use of Settlement Agreements. However, I want to be clear that no employee can be forced out - agreements will only be binding if they are genuinely voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="employment-tribunals"&gt;Employment tribunals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, there will always be those cases that cannot be settled through negotiation. Even in these instances, we believe there is substantial scope for improving the current unwieldy, expensive and delay-ridden system of employment tribunals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average claim now takes 24 weeks. No wonder some employers, especially smaller firms, choose to settle rather than sacrifice the time and expense required to defend themselves.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are introducing a range of measures to streamline and speed up the tribunals system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judges can now sit alone in hearings for unfair dismissal cases, rather than having to convene a tripartite panel. Witness statements no longer have to be read in full at a hearing.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judges can award costs of up to £20,000 to either party. And judges can order the claimant to pay a deposit of up to £1,000, where they consider that claims have little chance of success.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Government has consulted on introducing fees for Employment Tribunals. For those with a genuine claim, fees will not be a barrier to justice. But their introduction will encourage claimants to consider their cases carefully, leading to more realistic expectations for individuals and greater certainty for employers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tribunal reforms will mean that employers can once again have the confidence to hire the staff they need to grow and thrive. Of course, that doesn’t mean that all the issues associated with being an employer have been solved at a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the UK’s labour law originates in Brussels, so we are examining whether there is scope for removing or simplify laws that implement European Directives.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this work, we have been examining the rules governing collective redundancies. Lengthy consultation periods are not always necessary, and cause stress, uncertainty, and low morale for employees. Businesses also need flexibility to react to changing market condition. Moreover, it’ clear the UK is out of kilter with most other EU countries, with a much longer consultation period   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just launched a consultation on a set of proposals, which include developing a new Code of Practice and reducing the minimum timescale from 90 days to 30 or 45 days. Any changes will be implemented from April 2013.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also reviewing the TUPE Regulations, which preserve employees’ terms and conditions when a business is transferred to a new employer. These are complex rules. But we want to see whether we can make improvements whilst remaining compliant with the Acquired Rights Directive. We are currently analysing responses to our call for evidence and will respond soon.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, we are working hard to ensure proposals from Brussels do not jeopardise the UK’s growth prospects. That includes taking a close look at the existing EU rule book.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious example is how the European Court of Justice has interpreted the Working Time Directive. Most employees do not seriously expect to be given extra annual leave if they happen to fall ill while on holiday. But the court has ruled they have this entitlement.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions of this sort merely pile more burdens on employers and hamper their ability to expand and create new jobs. At a time when businesses are already feeling the pressure this is not a sensible way forward.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as a Government, we are determined to do everything we can to help businesses grow and create new jobs and new economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="modern-workplaces"&gt;Modern Workplaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same commitment- helping people to find work and keep it - also underpins our plans to extend the right to request flexible working, and to modernise maternity leave so it becomes shared and flexible parental leave.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family life has been transformed in recent decades. Most women now go out to work and men shoulder more of the duties at home. As roles and responsibilities have changed, our lives have become increasingly complex.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reforms will help millions of people juggle their commitments at work with their responsibilities at home. They will also ensure employers are able to recruit from the widest possible pool of talent.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also the thinking behind the decision to abolish the Default Retirement Age, doing away with the outdated notion that anyone who reaches the age of 65 has nothing to contribute economically.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflexible rules that fail to keep pace with the profound shifts we have seen in society serve no one, least of all employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am conscious that I have focused on legislative changes in my remarks today. But I’d like to finish by emphasising that this is just the beginning. We want to see a wider change in the employment relations culture in this country.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A culture that establishes dialogue rather than confrontation as the norm between employers and employees. That trusts people to do the right thing rather than relying on regulation to deal with every single issue that may arise. And that ensures businesses have the confidence to hire the talented and committed workforce they need in order to thrive.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have a way to go to get there. So the expertise of the CIPD and its members will be invaluable, as we work together to modernise employment relations and fuel the economic recovery we are all striving to achieve.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Collective redundancy rules to be changed</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;21 Jun 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new measures propose a more flexible regime and better consultation with staff. They seek to help companies respond to changing economic conditions. They also improve communication between managers and their staff to reduce uncertainty during the collective redundancy process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="consultation-on-collective-redundancies"&gt;Consultation on collective redundancies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has published a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/c/12-808-collective-redundancies-consultation.pdf"&gt;consultation on collective redundancies (PDF, 298 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;. This outlines the proposed measures and seeks views on a number of proposals by 19 September 2012. The proposals include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing a new, non-statutory, Code of Practice to give clearer information on how to conduct good quality consultations &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reducing the 90-day minimum consultation period for large scale redundancies (over 100 staff) to 45 or 30 days &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving the guidance for employers and employees on the support on offer from government &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes will mean that employers can restructure more effectively whilst ensuring that employees have access to good quality consultations. This should lead to better decision-making and limit the uncertainty and stress of the redundancy process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment Relations Minister Norman Lamb, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is never easy for employers or employees when redundancy is a possibility, but it’s clear that the current arrangements are not working in the best interests of either staff or managers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our reforms are about improving the quality of consultations - this really is a case of quality over quantity. The call for evidence showed that the current arrangements are not fit for purpose for the modern labour market and I would encourage people with an interest to get involved in the consultation. At present fear and uncertainty can hang over a workforce for three months, sometimes resulting in some of the best employees choosing to leave, even if they would not have ultimately been made redundant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some elements that government proposes to leave unchanged, including the Protective Award. This Award currently stands at a maximum of 90 days’ pay for each employee affected by a failure to consult and is paid by the employer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Beecroft report on employment law</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;21 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to the publication of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/r/12-825-report-on-employment-law-beecroft.pdf"&gt;the Beecroft report, (PDF, 184 Kb) &lt;/a&gt; Business Secretary Vince Cable said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are today publishing Mr Beecroft’s final report as submitted to our department to dispel some of the myths that have become associated with the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because of ongoing interest we reached a view that it is in the public interest to allow people to have access to its content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have always been clear that sensible and well thought-through reforms need a strong evidence base behind them, not just anecdotal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK already has one of the most flexible labour markets in the world, as evidenced by the deal struck by the Vauxhall workforce in Ellesmere Port last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At a time when workers are proving to be flexible in difficult economic conditions it would almost certainly be counterproductive to increase fear of dismissal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The government also has a duty to ensure the labour market provides economic and employment opportunities and has therefore set out a parliament-long review of employment law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As part of that review we have issued a call for evidence on no-fault dismissal for micro firms of fewer than 10 employees. I shall be examining the evidence when this is submitted to me after 8 June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mr Beecroft came and spoke to officials in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills last year whilst compiling his report. Consequently, the vast majority of proposals in Mr Beecroft’s final report reflect ongoing work by the department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In response to widespread concerns from small businesses we are simplifying employment tribunals with further measures in the planned &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/May/queens-speech-2012"&gt;Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill&lt;/a&gt;. And across government we have announced a number of measures for CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] checks, work permits and pensions auto-enrolment to help ease the burdens on business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has all happened independently from Mr Beecroft’s recommendations and were part of the government’s existing programme of reform and agenda for growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of Mr Beecroft’s recommendations was a suggestion to bring in no-fault dismissal. In my daily conversations with businesses, this has very rarely been raised with me as a barrier to growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Businesses are much more concerned about access to finance or weak demand than they are about this issue.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Help in hiring your first employee</title>

It also explains their core legal obligations, and guidance on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information on setting pay. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting the right insurance. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding tax requirements. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Checking a new employee’s right to work in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;** _ &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/employment-matters/employment-law-review/common-employment-myths"&gt; ** &lt;em&gt;Find out about more common myths when employing someone for the first time.&lt;/em&gt; ** &lt;/a&gt; _ **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new tool is part of the Business in You campaign, to encourage more people to start or grow their business throughout 2012 using a range of existing support services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment Relations Minister Norman Lamb welcomed the new guide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For many one-person businesses there is a belief that the process for taking on their first member of staff can be a daunting and overly complicated process. And with no one easily accessible source of guidance it can really feel burdensome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taking on an Employee toolkit aims to tackle this problem and will help empower our sole-traders, our one person businesses, to take that next step.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Red Tape Challenge and the online toolkit we are launching today are just two of the many measures we are taking to tackle employment regulation and to make sure it doesn’t act as a deterrent in hiring staff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we can provide the advice and information in a simple format, showing first-time employers that taking on staff can be a simple process, this will ultimately help in our efforts in creating jobs and encouraging growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback during the employment theme on the Red Tape Challenge highlighted that previous guidance and information was too complex and not readily available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Taking on an Employee toolkit aims to tackle these problems, by clearly outlining what an employer must do, why they must do it and how they can comply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call for evidence on workplace dismissal rules</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is examining current levels of understanding of the dismissal process in the workplace, and wants to hear from employees, businesses and all other interested parties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will include:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• awareness, understanding and use of the Acas Code of Practice on Discipline and Grievance. &lt;br&gt;
• the idea of compensated no-fault dismissal for micro-businesses with less than 10 employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_ &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/d/12-626-dismissal-for-micro-businesses-call"&gt;Take part in the call for evidence&lt;/a&gt; _&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK already has one of the world’s most flexible, adaptable labour markets, making it one of our strengths and it stands up very well in international comparisons. However, we recognise that there is room for improvement which balances the needs of business while ensuring that the necessary employment protections are upheld.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are already implementing a radical package of reforms to the employment tribunal system and increasing the qualifying period for unfair dismissal from one to two years. These are all measures that will help improve the way businesses hire, manage and end a working relationship.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we also recognise that not all jobs work out for both parties - the staff member doesn’t quite fit or simply the relationship has irretrievably broken down. And for micros in particular, who often don’t have legal or HR teams, the process to let a staff member go can be a daunting and complicated process.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want to give businesses the confidence to hire new staff and make sure when a dismissal needs to be made, they aren’t tied up in red tape. This is an effort to see how extensive the problem is and shed some light on the desire for a change to the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="employment-law-review"&gt;Employment Law Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government also published the annual update on the Employment Law Review.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes an update to the Employer’s Charter, which now includes pointers on sickness absence and recruitment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Charter aims to counter the misconception that employment protections are all one-way - towards the employee. It gives greater clarity to managers on what they can already do to deal with issues in the workplaces, on subjects such as performance, sick leave, maternity leave, requests for flexible working and redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>British Chambers of Commerce Annual Conference speech 15 March 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon. I’m grateful for this opportunity to speak to the British Chambers of Commerce and its many members. I value the strong and honest relationship that we enjoy: one fully maintained with John Longworth as your CEO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say you have played a critical role over the past year, working extensively with the government as we have got on with our core task of implementing a new economic strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One centred on boosting rates of private investment, increasing exports to growing markets in Asia and beyond, and encouraging start-ups throughout the country. You are providing valuable help to UKTI up and down the country to encourage inward investment, and are vital partners in our Business in You campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, it is visits to local chambers that tell me what business conditions are really like, rather then how they appear from Westminster. I am sometimes accused, for example, of being somewhat OTT in my criticisms of banks; this is at least in part the result of talking to Chambers across the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BCC’s frankness and insight have been invaluable, if at times rather bracing, and I am grateful for it. In particular, you have kept the government on its toes over efforts to hack through the thicket of red tape and bureaucracy that we inherited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I concentrated on the deregulation agenda when I spoke at this conference a year ago, and I would like to do so again today, outlining the progress we have made and where we intend to go next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain where I am coming from. I am not a believer in laissez faire. Government has a useful role in promoting innovation, training, better infrastructure and creating a framework of rules and standards which business needs to function. Thanks to a Whitehall mole my views on the need for an active industrial strategy are well known (and actually what a lot of business leaders say). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also believe that heavy-handed interventions from government - reaching for the statute book every time a new policy issue arises - have a negative effect on enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say all regulation is harmful. It isn’t. Carefully calibrated consistent interventions can help markets function better, give certainty to business, and confidence to consumers. But I do believe that an unthinking rush to regulate has been the default position in Whitehall for too long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="red-tape-challenge-and-oioo"&gt;Red tape challenge and OIOO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Tape Challenge, which I launched at this conference last year, has begun the process of drastically reducing the number of regulations affecting business to a more sensible level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are systematically working our way through all of them, organising the regulations by theme and publishing them on the website, so companies can tell us which ones are causing problems. Which ones are out of date. Which are out of all proportion with their original purpose. Which ones are just outlandish and need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have examined 16 themes and announced plans for five - retail; manufacturing; hospitality, food and drink; road transport; and employment law. I am pleased to report that of the 1,200 rules examined so far, well over 50% are being scrapped, consolidated or simplified. The first of these decisions were implemented in October last year, with more to follow in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the Red Tape Challenge, we are, for example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;completely overhauling the entertainment licensing system to help small venues;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising food labelling regulations - down from 31 to 17;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and bringing together 12 separate items of consumer legislation into one streamlined consumer bill of rights. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will shortly be announcing the results of the environmental theme in the Budget, which will simplify the requirements business must meet while maintaining essential protections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken individually, these may seem like small steps. Yes, they are. But that is how the burden built up - in small steps. The BCC has always been clear that it is the cumulative burden than is unbearable, and removing that burden will also take many small steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside these efforts to clear the welter of regulations already on the statute book - and more importantly - we are also changing the prevailing culture of government, which has historically viewed regulation as the easy option rather than the last resort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The One In, One Out rule - the first of its kind anywhere in the world - has begun to turn back the tide since it took effect in January 2011. Under its provisions, a minister who wants to introduce a new rule which generates costs for business must first identify a corresponding cut in regulation elsewhere with the same value. The process is designed to force departments to exhaust all the alternatives before seeking to legislate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to tell you that most of my ministerial colleagues regard One In One Out as an absolute pain; every time they bring forward a new regulation there is a big hurdle to cross. There will normally be a wounded-sounding letter saying “I am 100% with you on fighting regulation. But you surely didn’t mean me? My regulations are good!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So cultures do not change overnight. And proving progress to you will not be easy - after all, it is hard to show you what we stopped. But this simple yet revolutionary principle will enable us to cap and, over time, cut the costs of regulation borne by business - especially small business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is backed by a commitment to publish regular progress reports. The latest such report, the third Statement of New Regulation, was published just over a fortnight ago. It shows that the volume of deregulation far outweighs measures introduced - in the first six months of this year the government will introduce 19 deregulatory measures, generating net savings of over £16 million for business. It also shows that, since the introduction of the One In, One Out regime, it has delivered a net reduction in regulation costs for business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any successful attempt to cut back on red tape and bureaucracy must take account of the fact that a substantial proportion of the burden emanates from Brussels. Our first step was to end the gold-plating of new European Union directives. We are now looking at how to scrape off the accumulated gold plate of recent decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we want to tackle the issue at its roots we have to be much more active and engaged with the EU, and at a much earlier stage in the process. That means building alliances with other likeminded member states, so we speak with a louder voice and are better able to protect the interests of UK businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had some success in winning over a growing number of Member States to the view that reducing the overall burden of EU regulation is critical for the continent’s long-term growth prospects. Italy’s recent shift in favour of deregulation is a very welcome development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alliance-building has started to yield real results. In November we secured from the Commission a presumption that micro-businesses will be exempt from future EU legislation, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary. Alongside that was a commitment to examine current and forthcoming EU legislation to identify areas where SMEs could be subject to a light-touch regime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the UK’s persistent lobbying has finally delivered an exemption for micro-businesses from EU accounting rules - benefiting around 1.2 million UK SMEs and saving small firms across the EU up to €3.5 billion each year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, following UK lobbying, a new impact assessment unit is to be set up within the European Parliament to quantify the costs of its amendments to legislation. This should foster greater awareness among MEPs of the cost implications of their proposals and encourage more responsible decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where EU rules have proved most contentious is in relation to employment law. So let me make it clear that I am completely committed to fighting hard against intrusive and unnecessary burdens coming from EU that are damaging to Britain, with the working time directive as an obvious example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will delay and obstruct bad EU regulation using every means at our disposal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can’t blame the EU for everything, convenient as that would be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="employment-law"&gt;Employment law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of employment law, there are undoubtedly problems that have been created in Westminster rather than Brussels, and we have been striving over the past year to unblock them in a systematic way, where the evidence is compelling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading certain newspapers you could be forgiven for believing that nothing was happening or that government was rent by ideological conflict on this issue. Nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great deal of work is taking place to reform employment law. This is all set out in the report that I’m publishing today on our Parliament-long review of employment law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are right to proceed carefully, because uniquely in this area, employment law affects millions of employees - themselves a huge part of the economy. Acting clumsily might have serious consequences for certainty and confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this work has focused on overhauling employment tribunals which, for many businesses, have proved to be bureaucratic, time-consuming and costly - even when tribunals ultimately find in their favour. The fear of a tribunal has a particularly chilling effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large companies will, in most cases, have a specialist HR team which can deal with any cases that arise. Small firms do not have that luxury, so a tribunal means valuable days lost from getting on with the day job of building the business. The average tribunal claim costs £4,000 and takes 24 weeks to resolve: small wonder that some employers settle rather than contest the claim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And large numbers of employers are finding themselves caught up in the system - over 200,000 claims a year, on latest figures. It’s time to reform and streamline the regulatory framework that governs them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first set out our plans to tackle the issue in the government’s formal response to the Resolving Workplace Disputes late last year. The overriding objective is to cut the number of disputes going to tribunals each year - and cut the associated costs for business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, from next month, the qualifying period for the right to claim unfair dismissal will double from one to two years. The legislation was debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday. This will encourage employers to recruit new staff, and allow more time for these new relationships to take root. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will legislate so all claimants have to submit their complaint to ACAS, ensuring the two sides have the option of resolving their differences through conciliation before they can go to a tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even where conciliation doesn’t succeed, it should be possible in many cases to reach a settlement without a tribunal. So we are taking steps to simplify compromise agreements, which enable the parties to reach a no-fault deal in exchange for a guarantee not to bring future claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, some complaints will not be resolved through negotiation, and in these cases we are looking to improve the current system. Work is underway to develop a ‘Rapid Resolution’ scheme as a quicker and cheaper process for straightforward matters, and we will consult on our proposals in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also substantial scope for improving the bureaucratic and expensive tribunals system. I have asked Mr Justice Underhill to undertake a root-and-branch review of the rules governing employment tribunals, in order to modernise them and ensure we have a system that supports business expansion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have moved towards introducing fees for individuals who wish to take their employer to a tribunal, consulting on two options. They will not be a barrier to justice for those with a genuine claim. But fees will encourage potential claimants to think carefully about the validity of their case - leading to more realistic expectations for individuals and greater certainty for employers, and getting the users of the system to bear some of the costs. That consultation has closed and the Ministry of Justice is considering the responses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these reforms are tackling the unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy; the excessive costs; and the time wasted on lengthy employment tribunals. Our governing principle has been to do away with the perverse incentives that can dissuade responsible employers from hiring new staff, for fear of what may ensue if it doesn’t work out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some suggestions that it’s too difficult in the UK to deal with under performing employees, and that this is a barrier to effective workforce management. Small companies, which don’t have in-house legal or HR expertise, may be particularly affected. It is sometimes said that if it was made easier for small firms to fire there would be more hiring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are obvious risks for millions of good, conscientious employees and denting job security at a time when the economy and consumer confidence remain fragile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have launched a call for evidence on where the balance of the argument lies: whether dismissal might be made simpler, quicker and clearer; but without weakening the confidence and security of employees. We are also seeking views on the concept of ‘compensated no-fault dismissal’ for businesses with fewer than 10 employees. But let me stress that no decisions have been made to go down that path: we would only do so if there is strong and credible evidence to justify it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to remember, in the politically heated debates around dismissal, that on almost every measure Britain has one of the Western world’s most flexible labour markets. That is how many firms managed to get through the financial crisis and recession. And compared with France, or even Germany, our laws are very accommodating to employers. We have put out the Employers Charter to remind managers of the rights and flexibilities they enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progress we are making on all these fronts - the Red Tape Challenge; the One In One Out regime; stemming the flow of EU legislation; overhauling the employment law framework - adds up to a co-ordinated plan of action designed to change the regulatory culture within government and seriously to cut back on red tape. The Coalition Government is working together to deliver this agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>£1 billion Youth Contract</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting next April the Youth Contract will provide at least 410,000 new work places for 18 to 24 year olds. This will be over a three-year period.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes wage subsidies worth £2,275 handed to employers to take on 160,000 18 to 24-year-olds.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching the initiative at a college in Leeds, Nick Clegg said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The aim of the Youth Contract is to get every unemployed young person earning or learning again before long term damage is done.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a £1bn package and what’s different about it is gets young people into proper, lasting jobs in the private sector.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But it’s a contract, a two-way street: if you sign up for the job, they’ll be no signing on for the dole. You have to stick with it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="youth-contract"&gt;Youth Contract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new programme will help the most disengaged 16 and 17 year olds by getting them back to school or college, onto an apprenticeship or into a job with training.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra funding for apprenticeships and a £50 million programme to help persistently NEET 16 and 17-year-olds will be on offer too.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Youth Contract is open to all businesses, including those that already employ large numbers of young people (like retail and construction) and emerging sectors (like the green economy, creative industries and ICT).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor will announce the details of all spending changes, including the Youth Contract, in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/as2011"&gt;Autumn Statement on 29 November. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Reforms to job laws to help business</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the Government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/growth"&gt;plan for growth &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, Business Secretary Vince Cable has proposed cutting unnecessary demands on business while safeguarding workers’ rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A package of measures will retain key protections for employees, but also fundamentally improve the way employers take people on, manage disputes and let people go. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overhaul of employment tribunals, which is expected to deliver £40 million a year in benefits to employers. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a call for evidence on whether the 90 day minimum consultation period for collective redundancies is restricting businesses and should be reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our labour market is already one of the most flexible in the world. This flexibility benefits businesses, staff and the wider economy. But many employers still feel that employment law is a barrier to growing their business.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re knocking down that barrier today - getting the state out of the way, making it easier for businesses to take on staff and improving the process for when staff have to be let go.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="unfair-dismissal"&gt;Unfair Dismissal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the suggestion that dismissal laws are too onerous for small businesses in particular, the Government will launch a call for evidence on two proposals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly it will seek views on a proposal to introduce compensated no fault dismissal for micro firms, with fewer than 10 employees. Secondly, it will look at ways to slim down existing dismissal processes, how they might be simplified, including potentially working with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) to make changes to their Code, or supplementary guidance for small businesses.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplifying the employment tribunals system for businesses will result in fewer claims each year. These reforms will deliver direct net savings to business of more than £10 million a year with wider benefits to employers estimated at more than £40 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let me be clear: we are not re-balancing employment law simply in the direction of employers. Our proposals strike an appropriate balance and we are keeping the necessary protections already in place to protect employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our proposals are not - emphatically not - an attempt to give businesses an easy ride at the expense of their staff. Nor have we made a cynical choice to favour flexibility over fairness.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know that disputes at work cost time and money, reduce productivity and can distract employers from the day-to-day running of their business. Tribunals should be a last resort for workplace problems which is why we want disputes to be solved in other ways.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cutting-employment-regulation"&gt;Cutting employment regulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 159 regulations examined in the employment theme of the Red Tape Challenge more than 70 regulations, over 40 per cent, are to be merged, simplified or scrapped. The Government will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish a call for evidence on proposals to simplify the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) - TUPE - rules which many businesses say are too complex and bureaucratic. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Close a whistleblowing case law loophole which allows employees to blow the whistle about their own personal work contract. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merge 17 National Minimum Wage regulations into one set. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consult in the spring to streamline the current regulatory regime for the recruitment sector. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a universally portable CRB check that can be viewed by employers instantly online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="response-to-resolving-workplace-disputes"&gt;Response to Resolving Workplace Disputes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requiring all employment disputes to go to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) to be offered pre-claim conciliation before going to a tribunal and from April 2012 increasing the qualification period for unfair dismissal from one to two years.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing a consultation in the new year on ‘protected conversations’ which allows employers to discuss issues like retirement or poor performance in an open manner with staff - without this being used in any subsequent tribunal claims.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appointing Mr Justice Underhill to lead an independent review of the existing rules of procedure governing employment tribunals. This review will look to address concerns that they have become increasingly complex and inefficient over time and are no longer fit for purpose.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consultation on measures to simplify compromise agreements, which will be renamed ‘settlement agreements’. A compromise agreement is a type of employment contract, which means when the working relationship has broken down to an irretrievable status, employees receive a negotiated financial sum to end their contract, and agree to not bring further claims against their employer.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcing plans to consider how and whether to develop a ‘rapid resolution’ scheme which will offer a quicker and cheaper alternative to determination at an employment tribunal. Any proposals would be the subject of a consultation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modifying the formulae for up-rating employment tribunal awards and statutory redundancy payments to round to the nearest pound. We anticipate that the reduction in redundancy pay and subsequent reduction in associated compensation payments made in employment tribunals will have a direct net saving to business of £5.4. million each year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these changes will require the Government to introduce primary legislation, subject to the Parliamentary timetable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>Reforming employment relations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning. My thanks to Terry Scuoler and the EEF for organising this event today. I think it is fair to say we have an extremely good and fruitful relationship with this organisation. It is not empty flattery for me to say you have worked with us extensively on a series of tasks in government - particularly on the review of manufacturing, which is absolutely central to our economic strategy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m not here to talk about that today. The EEF has contributed to another review - our comprehensive review of employment legislation - with the same degree of frankness and insight. Emphasising the critical importance of flexibility and spelling out the impact of the laws governing unfair dismissal; employment tribunals; and regulations emanating from Brussels such as the Pregnant Workers Directive.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The willingness to speak truth to power is more important than it has ever been, because we are meeting against a backdrop of immense uncertainty in the global economy. The Eurozone sovereign debt crisis is reverberating through financial markets and it is affecting the real economy, here and elsewhere, depressing demand. How it plays out is going to have far-reaching consequences for the country.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is no reason for us to give into pessimism and resign ourselves to anaemic growth in the years ahead. That’s why in government we have embarked on a comprehensive review of growth and how we can clear away the structural barriers to economic recovery.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I want to set out our plans to radically reform employment relations - we want to safeguard workers’ rights, while deregulating to reduce the onerous and unnecessary demands on businesses.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with the proposition that flexible labour markets are an essential component of a successful economy. It’s essential they function in a way that employers have the confidence to take on new workers, create new jobs, so people out of work can get that first foot in the labour market.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our starting point is that Britain’s employment practices stand up very well to international comparison. According to the OECD, the UK has one of the most effective and lightly regulated labour markets among developed economies: it describes us as a ‘successful employment performer’.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is one of the reasons the unemployment rate remained lower than many forecasters had suggested during the recent crisis and recession. Many private sector managers and trades unions - including many in the manufacturing sector - showed remarkable wisdom and flexibility when they were really up against it. They agreed flexibility, pay cuts and part-time working in order to save jobs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think businesses increasingly recognise this government’s determination to address the flaws that are present within a system that in general works very well. A recent survey of SMEs, commissioned by BIS, revealed that the proportion regarding regulation, including employment regulation, as the main obstacle to business success was only 6% - and it has halved over the last two years. We still have a way to go, clearly, but we are moving in the right direction and we are committed to addressing the remaining concerns.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we want to remove the perverse incentives in current employment framework that can dissuade responsible employers from hiring new staff for fear of the costs and the time incurred if it doesn’t work out.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important step a growing or new business ever takes is to recruit its first employee. So the need to ensure flexibility for the employer and security for the staff member has to be very carefully balanced, otherwise it damages the incentive to make the relationship work.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the underlying reason why we launched a comprehensive review of employment laws, which my colleague Ed Davey has been leading in the department. And why today we are outlining a package of measures to improve the way businesses hire, manage and end relationships with employees, when this proves to be necessary.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to stress that our proposals are not - quite emphatically not - an attempt to give businesses an easy ride at the expense of their staff. This is not about introducing a ‘hire and fire’ culture. We are not making a cynical choice to favour flexibility over fairness.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what we are doing here is hacking through the excessive red tape and regulation that prevents too many businesses from creating new jobs in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="reducing-workplace-disputes-measures"&gt;Reducing Workplace Disputes measures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this more apparent than in the employment tribunal system, which employers have told me time and again is far too costly, and time-consuming, and complex.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a very big company you can afford the dedicated and expensive HR personnel to deal with cases that arise. But for small business owners, it means days dealing with it themselves personally - valuable time lost from running and growing their company.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And workplace disputes are increasingly being settled through tribunals - over 200,000 claims last year. We are in danger of getting away from the principle that they should be the last resort, not the first option. But there is a widespread feeling it is too easy to make unmerited claims - and that the whole system militates against early resolution of disputes through dialogue rather than confrontation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tackle these problems, and to remove the incentives that exist for employers not to hire, we intend to radically reform the tribunals system. Our plans are set out in the government’s formal response to the Reducing Workplace Disputes consultation which we conducted earlier this year, and we estimate they will deliver £40m in direct savings to employers each year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost we want to reduce the number of tribunals happening in any one year - because we believe the only winners from that are the lawyers. So in future, all claimants will be obliged to submit their complaint to ACAS, in order that parties are given an opportunity to resolve their dispute through conciliation before it can be taken to a tribunal.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are introducing a system of ‘protected conversations’. These will allow employers to raise issues such as poor performance or retirement plans in an open way, free from the worry it will be used as evidence in a subsequent tribunal claim. We will be consulting on the detail of this proposal in the New Year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where relations have broken down, we want it to be as easy as possible for both parties to reach a settlement without a tribunal. Therefore we will consult on simplifying compromise arrangements, to enable the two sides to reach a no-fault settlement in exchange for an agreement not to bring future claims.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there will always be those cases that cannot be settled through negotiation. But for more straightforward matters such as a dispute over holiday pay, a tribunal with all its costs is an unnecessarily burdensome way of finding a resolution. So I am today announcing our intention to look at ways of providing a quicker and cheaper alternative to a tribunal hearing - a ‘Rapid Resolution’ scheme.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are looking at a variety of options - but it could involve an independent legal expert reaching decisions based on written evidence. We will be working on the detail in the months ahead and the scheme will be subject to a full public consultation before being implemented.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in those instances where an employment tribunal is the only way a claim can be resolved, we believe there is substantial scope for improving the current very unwieldy, expensive and delay-ridden system.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average claim costs £4,000 and takes 24 weeks, which may not be an issue for a major employer but it is for an SME. And what often happens is that some employers decide to settle rather than face the time and expense required to defend themselves.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I have asked Mr Justice Underhill to undertake a root-and-branch review of the rules governing employment tribunals, in order to modernise them and ensure we have a system that meets the needs of an economy which is striving to recover and grow.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we believe it is reasonable there should be a cost to starting a tribunal case - especially if it encourages an individual to think long and hard about the validity of the claim. Too many people have unrealistic expectations about the scale of award they may receive, and perhaps don’t think carefully about the type of claim they should bring.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing different fees for different kinds of claim will encourage potential claimants to fully consider their cases - leading to more realistic expectations for individuals and greater certainties for employers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to make it very clear that for those with a genuine claim, fees will not be a barrier to justice. We will ensure that there is a remissions system for those who need help.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm therefore that the Ministry of Justice will shortly publish a consultation on introducing fees for anyone wishing to take a claim to an employment tribunal. We will be seeking views on two options. The first proposes a system that involves payment of a fee to lodge a claim, and a second fee to take that claim to a hearing. The second option proposes introducing a £30,000 threshold, so those seeking an award of more than £30,000 will pay more.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to close a loophole in the Public Interest Disclosure Act relating to whistle-blowing. It has become apparent through case law that employees are able to blow the whistle about breaches to their own personal work contract. This is not what the legislation is designed to achieve and we are going to stop this in future.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these measures will address the unnecessary bureaucracy associated with employment tribunals; the excessive costs, and the time wasted on lengthy hearings. A coherent and far-reaching programme of reform in this area is essential and that is what we are pursuing.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to do is balance our support for job creators to grow their businesses with the need to provide job security in these uncertain times. And that’s why we are doubling the qualifying period for the right to claim unfair dismissal from one year to two years.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of increasing the qualifying period is to give greater confidence to employers in recruiting new employees, without undermining workers’ sense of job security at a time when consumer confidence is low.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there have been some suggestions over recent weeks that our dismissal procedures are too onerous, particularly for small businesses, and questions over whether they lead to fair outcomes for employees and employers.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is required is a cool analysis of the evidence, the views of employees and employers, and the implications for job creation and productivity. And that is why, alongside the measures I have set out, we will begin a call for evidence on two proposals for reform of our employment laws. I want to hear the different views of employees, business organisations and other interested parties.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we are seeking views on a proposal to introduce compensated no-fault dismissal for micro firms - that is those with 10 or fewer employees. Now I stress that we are seeking evidence on both sides. We don’t want to dent job security and consumer confidence and we have to seek a balance here.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we will look at radically slimming down our existing dismissal processes. These can be, and are often perceived to be, lengthy and unfair to both employers and employees. So we will also be seeking views on how we might move to a simpler, quicker and clearer dismissal process - including, potentially, by working with ACAS to make changes to their Code, or by introducing supplementary guidance for small businesses.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our objective is to strike a sensible balance between the need to give poorly performing workers reasonable warning that they should improve their performance; and the need to ensure that employers, especially SMEs, have the flexibility to manage their staff if they are not performing adequately in spite of warnings. And to do so without getting tangled up in red tape and bureaucracy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we will consider all the evidence and representations we receive over the coming weeks, and then decide how best to take forward the government’s twin objectives of supporting private sector job creation while ensuring employment security.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, I am struck as I travel the world promoting British businesses and exports how far behind Germany we are, particularly in many emerging markets. Yet the Germans have a model of employee relations where they treat their employees as a resource, an asset - they don’t think of them as a cost, a liability. Their employees help to run companies, and indeed set executive pay. I think we could do with a bit more ‘Vorsprung durch Technik’ in British businesses.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the vast majority of UK businesses do treat their staff with respect - it is in their commercial interests to do so, to have motivated staff and a culture of mutual trust in the workplace. Our reforms to employment tribunals, and commitment to reviewing dismissal procedures, will mean that businesses can once again have the confidence to hire the staff they need to grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="red-tape-challenge-on-employment-law"&gt;Red tape challenge on employment law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean that all the issues associated with being an employer have been solved at a stroke.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Tape Challenge on employment law, which saw all the rules and regulations published online so businesses could tell us what was causing them problems, has identified a number of other areas ripe for reform. As a result, of the 159 regulations looked at, over 40% are to be merged, simplified or scrapped.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the bureaucracy associated with a Criminal Records Bureau check has been a long-standing complaint for employers and staff alike. The length of time it can take has meant some people are not able to start the job they have been offered. And the need to get fresh clearance every time a person changes jobs just adds to the frustration and expense, actually £44 a time.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Home Office has pledged that, from 2013, once a CRB check has been conducted the results will be available and instantly accessible online, for employers to confirm no new information has been added since the check was conducted. For a small annual fee, the individual’s record will be kept up to date - putting an end to agonising delays and repeated expensive applications.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This long overdue reform will be a particular relief to employers and self-employed people who have to obtain a new check for each new contract. It is a simple change that will bring real benefits and make the search for a job that little bit easier.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we have plans to simplify and streamline the UK’s recruitment sector to help smooth the path into work. It is an absolutely key part of our flexible labour market, enabling companies to respond to fluctuating demand and giving individuals an important entry point into the jobs market.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around two million people find work through the recruitment sector - but the rules that hiring businesses must comply with are hugely complex. We are going to consult next year with a view to scrapping unnecessary rules and making the remaining ones more comprehensible to business, so they can use agency workers as flexibly as possible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside this, we are committed to reviewing the paperwork around implementation of the Agency Workers Directive, in 18 months’ time, with a focus on looking for opportunities to simplify it.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will also simplify the National Minimum Wage regulations, merging the current body of 17 different regulations into a single consolidated set, and complementing the work the Low Pay Commission is already doing to streamline the regime.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be absolutely clear this is not an attempt to reopen discussion on the principle of a National Minimum Wage - our commitment to that is absolute. We merely want to ensure that its administration is as light touch as possible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suite of measures will help to make the process of employing a new staff member less daunting, with less time wasted on form-filling and box-ticking merely to please the bureaucracy.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just as importantly, we need to ensure businesses have the flexibility to manage their workforce in a way that enables them to respond to changing demand and market patterns.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today we are launching two further calls for evidence. The first is on the rules governing statutory consultations on Collective Redundancies. We often hear that the 90-day period is too long and consequently it holds up the implementation of agreements that have already been struck.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inability to get on with the necessary restructuring can make the process even more painful than inevitably it will be. We want to explore the consequences of reducing the current 90-day limit to 60, 45, or possibly even 30 days. But we are looking for evidence and we have an open mind.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we understand that there are real benefits to having effective consultation periods. So we want to explore how employees’ representatives use consultation to limit the impact of the redundancies on employees. And how Government can use the minimum periods to work with affected employees to help them find new employment or training opportunities. When we have all the information - both sides of the argument - we will make a decision based on the facts.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second call for evidence is on the current TUPE rules. Businesses have expressed concerns that the arrangements are overly bureaucratic and may, in some areas such as service provision, unnecessarily gold-plate European rules.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are therefore seeking views on how the rules might be simplified to enable necessary business restructuring, while continuing to provide appropriate levels of protection to employees.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plans we are setting out today will give businesses the confidence to take on new staff - and create new opportunities for people looking for work. It is important to remember that fact, because the guiding principle is to ensure that everyone who wants to work, and is able to so, can do so.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we specifically asked Dame Carol Black and David Frost to undertake their review into sickness absence. They published their report on Monday, setting out recommendations to ensure people are not shut out of the labour market purely because of ill-health. We will look at them in detail and respond to the report next year.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same principle - helping people to find work and keep it - also underpins our commitment to extend the right to request flexible working, and to modernise maternity leave so it becomes shared and flexible parental leave. These reforms will help millions of people juggle their commitments at work with their responsibilities at home.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family life has been transformed in recent decades. Most women now go out to work and men shoulder more of the duties at home - at least we hope they do. As roles and responsibilities have changed, our lives have become increasingly complex. And that’s not just true of parents with young children. Many have to combine working with looking after an elderly parent, a sick partner, or a grandchild. Extending the right to request flexible working to everybody will make that difficult job easier.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are committed to extending flexibility at work in a way that avoids imposing any unnecessary burdens or costs on companies. We want to deliver the real economic and business benefits that flexible working brings. Research by the CBI, for example, has found that 63% of firms offering flexible working report lower staff turnover - producing savings on recruitment and training costs. It is in their interests, too.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater flexibility is also required in relation to parental leave, to keep up with the profound shifts in society we have witnessed in recent decades. Nearly all fathers, 94%, take time off when their child is born, but around 30% are supplementing their paternity leave with their holiday entitlement. There is a demand here that is not being met.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed research by the Fatherhood Institute has found that a quarter of fathers change jobs, often in the first two years after a child is born, so they can spend more time with their families. This inevitably generates costs for employers, so the answer lies in a system of leave that reflects modern patterns of parenting, but in a way that does not mean extra costs or regulation for business.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans empower individuals to balance work and home life, helping to keep them in the labour market, and they give businesses a larger pool of potential recruits. They will also enable companies to hold onto skilled and experienced staff and keep down costs. So everyone should benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let me just say in conclusion, I am conscious that the plans I have outlined today focus on legislative changes to the employment law framework. But changing the legislation is only a beginning. We want to see a wider change in the employment relations culture.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A culture that establishes dialogue rather than confrontation as the norm between employers and employees. That trusts people to do the right thing rather than relying on regulation to deal with every single issue that arises. And that ensures businesses have the confidence to hire the talented and committed workforce they need in order to thrive.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package of measures I have announced today carefully balances the needs of employers with the rights of individuals. But we still have to work through the fine detail in the months ahead to make sure we get it absolutely right.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that is why, as we focus on implementation, we are asking for your input - to ensure our ambitious plans to deregulate and modernise employment relations genuinely help fuel the economic recovery we are striving to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Tackling employment law red tape</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next three weeks &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/employment-related-law/"&gt;the Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; will focus on more than 160 different cross-Government employment related regulations that businesses have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign asks how regulations can be improved, simplified or even abolished, whilst also ensuring that the current standard of employment rights for employees are maintained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister David Willetts said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Businesses regularly tell us that the burden of regulation is too high. So today we are giving them a chance to tell us exactly which rules they think need to be reformed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they are fit for purpose and easier for businesses to understand, examples of regulations you can comment on include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules on collective redundancies. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employment agencies. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immigration checks. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The National Minimum Wage. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Statutory sick pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employment Relations Minister Edward Davey said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We often hear from businesses that employment related regulation holds them back from growing their firms and employing more people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whether it is the filling out of endless forms when you hire your first member of staff, the complexities of letting somebody go, or simply manage staff on a day-to-day basis, we want to review these regulations with the aim of giving business more confidence in employing people and creating more jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/employment-matters/employment-law-review"&gt;The Employment Law Review&lt;/a&gt; is a Parliament long review looking at all aspects of employment law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discussion paper, entitled &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/F/11-1308-flexible-effective-fair-labour-market"&gt;‘Flexible, effective, fair: Promoting economic growth through a strong and efficient labour market,’&lt;/a&gt; has also been published today. This paper sets out the principles that are guiding our approach to reform of the labour market framework along with a number of thematic questions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Davey added: “We are determined to tackle unnecessary, burdensome red tape that harms job creation and means employers spend less time running their business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But this does not mean this will result in a watering down of employee rights. Today we are launching a real debate with employers and employees, to listen to their thoughts and act on what regulations can be simplified, merged and abolished. This is your time to get involved and have your say on your employment law bugbears.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government will publish the results of the employment related law Red Tape Challenge theme later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Modern Workplaces</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few days we have marked the first anniversary of the Coalition. In the year since its formation, our central task has been to overcome our dire economic inheritance, and stabilise the country’s public finances and achieve sustainable growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth must come from private enterprise, from businesses investing, hiring, exporting and expanding. But government must play its part, too, clearing away the barriers to expansion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexible labour markets are an essential component of a successful economy, enabling companies to respond to demand and create new employment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain’s employment practices already compare well internationally - they are one of the reasons the unemployment rate remained lower than many forecasts suggested during the recession. Many private sector managers and their unions showed remarkable elasticity under pressure, adopting pay cuts and part time working to save jobs. But the current framework also contains perverse incentives that can dissuade responsible employers from hiring new staff for fear of ending up in a tribunal if it doesn’t work out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s essential the labour market functions in a way that gives employers the confidence to create new jobs, so people out of work can get a foot in the door. We are therefore proposing simplifying employment tribunals, insisting on more mediation and extending the period before a claim can be brought, to encourage employers to expand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also have to increase participation rates - so that those who want and are able to work can do so, and we keep skilled workers in the labour force - not least to protect the investment employers have made in them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, this requires recognition of the profound shifts that have taken place in British society. Family life has been transformed in recent decades, and the traditional stereotypes no longer apply. Most women now go out to work and men - hopefully - shoulder more of the duties at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As roles and responsibilities have changed, our lives have become increasingly complex. And that’s not just true of parents with young children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of people have responsibilities to live up to - whether looking after an elderly parent, a sick partner, or a grandchild - while holding down a job. Keeping all these plates spinning at once can be tough. Unlike some of my colleagues I haven’t had to juggle the responsibilities of being a minister and a father of young children; but as an MP I had to act as a carer for a terminally ill partner and soon came to appreciate the enormous practical and emotional demands which this creates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need modern workplaces that reflect modern Britain. Otherwise we run the risk of people cracking up, dropping out of the labour force, and losing essential skills from the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I am launching a consultation on proposals that respond to these social trends, leaving behind outdated notions of family life and giving individuals the ability to balance their commitments at work with their responsibilities at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret some business groups are wary of changes in this area, concerned that new legislation will tie their members up in red tape or weigh them down with new regulations. That’s the last thing we want, so nothing will change until the nuts and bolts of the system have been examined in discussion with all the interested parties; including business groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this consultation is to extend flexible at work in a way that avoids imposing any unnecessary burdens or costs on companies, while delivering the real economic and business benefits that flexible working brings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research by the CBI, for example, has found that 63% of firms offering flexible working report lower staff turnover - producing savings on recruitment and training costs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And according to the British Chambers of Commerce, nearly six out of ten small firms have reported improvements to productivity as a result of flexible working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our reforms will extend these benefits to more businesses. So let me outline what we are proposing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="flexible-parental-leave"&gt;Flexible Parental leave&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current arrangements for maternity and paternity leave are too rigid, resting on antiquated notions of family life and, bizarrely, letting the state dictate which parent should look after a new child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time we got away from lazy assumptions about women in the workplace. Today, 44% of women earn as much as or more than their partner, meaning that for many families it makes clear financial sense for the leave to be split more evenly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new system of flexible parental leave we are proposing will give families the freedom to make their own decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are proposing giving families four months paid maternity leave, and five months paid parental leave that can be taken by either parent, so couples have more say over how they share childcare. We are also looking at introducing a month of ‘use it or lose it’ leave for fathers, to encourage them to be more involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want the system to be properly flexible. Currently, there is no way new parents can take leave at the same time if that’s what they want to do, save for the two weeks of statutory paternity leave. Mothers have no way to engineer a gradual return to work, and parents are unable to take leave in anything other than single, monolithic blocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know our plans to allow parents to take leave in chunks have caused some consternation. So I would like to clear up the misconception this is a new legal right: it isn’t. It will only be possible if employers agree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our proposals are about encouraging a grown-up conversation between the staff member and the company. If it doesn’t work for the business, the employer is entitled to reject the request. So an SME that would find it too disruptive can and should say no. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many companies will find the extra flexibility gives them the ability to manage their workforce better, allowing them to bring staff back in to deal with big projects or peaks in demand, such as the pre-Christmas rush. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And administration will be kept to an absolute minimum: parents will provide self-certified notice of their leave plans to their employer, signed by both parents to demonstrate the request is genuine. We don’t anticipate employers having to talk to one another to check the validity of a claim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from harming companies’ prospects, analysis suggests measures like these help to boost business performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research by the London School of Economics has found that organisations which offer a range of family-friendly policies perform better than average. In particular, those offering parental leave are 60% more likely to perform well financially and 35% more likely to have above average productivity, than those offering none. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, giving women more control over when and how they return to work makes them more likely to stay with their employer, retaining their skills for the company and producing a better return on investment in training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our proposals will also be important steps in tackling the underlying causes of the gender pay gap, in particular by helping to reduce the impact on women of taking time out of the labour market to have children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where discrimination does happen, however, it should be stamped out. So we are going further, by requiring employers who lose Employment Tribunal cases on equal pay to carry out a pay audit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are not overlooking the needs of men. Nearly all fathers, 94%, take time off when their child is born, but around 30% are supplementing their paternity leave with their holiday entitlement. There is a demand here that is not being met. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed research by the Fatherhood Institute has found that a quarter of fathers change job, often in the first two years after a child is born, so they can spend more time with their families. This inevitably generates costs for employers, so the answer lies in a system of leave that reflects modern patterns of parenting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And fathers involved in caring for their children early on are more likely to remain in the child’s life, even if the family breaks up. Sustaining that relationship reaps clear social dividends: children with strong paternal relations have fewer behavioural problems, lower rates of criminality and better qualifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So supporting responsible parents, and enabling them to harmonise the rhythms of their lives at work and home, is good for society, good for the economy and good for business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="flexible-working"&gt;Flexible working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I noted at the start, it’s not just parents who struggle to maintain that balance. Demographic trends and the redefinition of modern family structures are just two of the reasons why people today face increasing demands in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to work flexibly can ease these pressures and enable individuals to remain in the labour force - a fact recognised by the 95% of employers which already offer at least one form of flexible working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its benefits for business were vividly illustrated during the recession, when - as I noted above- many companies used flexible working to manage the collapse in demand without losing the workforce skills they had invested in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a perception still exists that flexible working is only an option for women with children. It is reinforced by the experience of employees, with less than half reporting their manager actively promotes it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a clear right to request flexible working will raise awareness and give employees the confidence to discuss options with their employers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as is the case with the existing rules, it is purely a right to request: businesses will still be able to reject applications on business grounds. And we are also proposing to give employers the ability to consider the individual’s circumstances where they have competing requests from employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure these changes don’t generate a wave of extra form-filling and box-ticking for companies, we are proposing scrapping the statutory process and replacing it with a code of practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this approach, employees will be clear about their rights, but employers can deal with requests without wasting time and money on unnecessary red tape - they just need to handle requests reasonably. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it would be wrong to imagine that suddenly everyone will request flexible working: many people don’t want it. The predictability that comes from having a set pattern of working hours is itself a useful way of balancing work and home life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who do, however, our proposals will help keep them in the labour market, giving businesses a larger pool of potential recruits. They will also enable companies to hold onto skilled and experienced staff, keeping down costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility is also a good way of boosting staff commitment and loyalty, which can have beneficial effects in terms of better productivity and higher profitability. And research by the BCC found that 70% of companies said offering flexible working had improved workplace relations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For businesses still feeling the aftershocks of the worst recession in sixty years, that can only be a good thing. It’s also good for the UK economy. Now more than ever, our economy needs the private sector to grow and expand, and flexible labour markets are a crucial ingredient of success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we help people manage their lives and stay in employment, we can avoid losing the skills, talent and energy of millions of people to the UK economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are not about to make life more difficult for companies by imposing onerous new regulations. That’s why, starting with the consultation being launched today, we want your input so the introduction of flexible working fuels the economic recovery we all want to see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Creating a modern workplace</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government today launched &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/modernworkplaces/"&gt;a consultation on plans to introduce a new system of flexible parental leave from 2015 &lt;/a&gt;as part of its plans to create a modern workplace for the modern economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the proposals, once the early weeks of maternity and paternity leave have ended, parents will be able to share the overall leave allowance between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the current system this leave could be taken in a number of different blocks and both parents could take leave at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-being-proposed"&gt;What is being proposed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Parental Leave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18 weeks maternity leave and pay - in one continuous block around birth. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four weeks of parental leave and pay exclusive to each parent to be taken in the first year. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30 weeks of additional parental leave available to either parent - of which 17 weeks would be paid and can be broken in blocks between parents. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending the right to request for all workers who have been with their employer for 26 weeks. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Government will consider publishing a statutory Code of Practice for businesses. It will propose that employers should be allowed to take into account employees individual circumstances when considering conflicting requests. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are no plans to alter the current 8 business reasons for a business to turn down a request. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Government recognises that legislation is not the only answer to promoting flexible working practices. Non-legislative measures are being developed to promote flexible working opportunities both for those with a job and for those looking for one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Equal Pay **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employment Tribunals that have found an employer to have discriminated on gender in relation to pay, will order the employer to conduct a pay audit and publish their results (except in some circumstances, such as where an audit has already been conducted). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our proposals will encourage greater choice by giving employees and their employers the flexibility to find arrangements to suit them both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New parents should be able to choose their childcare arrangements for themselves, rather than being dictated to by rigid Government regulation as is currently the case. And employers should be encouraged to come to agreement with employees on how work and family responsibilities can be met simultaneously.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These measures are fairer for fathers and maintain the existing entitlements for mothers - but crucially give parents much greater choice over how to balance their work and family commitments.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course I’m mindful of the need to minimise the costs, bureaucracy and complexities on businesses. This has been at the forefront of my mind throughout the development of our proposals. So we will ensure that businesses will still be able to take into account their needs when agreeing how leave can be taken. But I’m also confident that we have a good case to make on the wider benefits to business - not least from a motivated and flexible workforce and we will be making this case to employers over the next few years before these changes are introduced.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next steps in employment law review</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing review into employment law is an important part of the Government’s plans to deliver growth by breaking down barriers, boosting opportunities and creating the right conditions for businesses to start up and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New areas that will be reviewed include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collective redundancy consultation periods. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/tupe"&gt;Transfer Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations (TUPE). &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compensation for discrimination awarded by employment tribunals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will start reviewing these areas this year. It wants to ensure that the regulations are fit for purpose, and legislation will not necessarily be the route to implement any change if there is a case for reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment Relations Minister Edward Davey detailed the plans during a speech at the Institute of Economic Affairs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Davey said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The areas we are reviewing are priorities for employers. We want to make it easier for businesses to take on staff and grow.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will be looking carefully at the arguments for reform. Fairness for individuals will not be compromised - but where we can make legislation easier to understand, improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy we will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="employment-law-review"&gt;Employment Law Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Employment Law Review was announced last summer the Government has: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2011/Jan/workplace-dispute-reforms-and-employers-charter"&gt;Consulted on a package of reforms to the employment tribunal system&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at encouraging earlier resolution of disputes in the workplace and reducing the number of tribunal cases (which are costly for employers, employees and Government). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launched an &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/e/employerscharter.pdf"&gt;Employer’s Charter&lt;/a&gt; that reassures employers about what they can already do to deal with staff issues in the workplace. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launched a review of the compliance and enforcement regimes for employment law, with the aim of streamlining the system. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2011/Jan/default-retirement-age-to-end"&gt;Removed the Default Retirement Age&lt;/a&gt;, thus removing significant paperwork obligations for employers and bringing wider benefits to the economy, making it easier for older people to continue working &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Announced the proposed abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board and Agricultural Minimum Wage, pending consultation and the Parliamentary process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commissioned an independent review jointly with DWP (from David Frost and Dame Carol Black) of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/sickness-absence-review/"&gt;system for managing sickness absence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repealed the planned extension of the right to request flexible working to parents of 17 year olds &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decided not to bring forward the dual discrimination provision in the Equality Act &lt;br&gt;
not extended the right to request time to train to companies with fewer than 250 staff. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Government will also look for ways to simplify the burden of paperwork, particularly in the areas of flexible working and parental leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government believes that a flexible labour market is not simply about making life easy for employers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also determined to help people who want to work. Next week it will launch a consultation on plans to extend the right to request flexible working to all employees and introduce a new system of shared parental leave from 2015 - to make it easier for parents to work whilst bringing up a family.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employer's guidance for new agency laws</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/a/11-949-agency-workers-regulations-guidance.pdf"&gt;The guidance (PDF, 329 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;will help hirers and agencies understand the requirements of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/employment-matters/strategies/awd"&gt;Agency Workers Regulations&lt;/a&gt;. Separate guidance for agency workers will be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Regulations implement the EU Agency Workers Directive as agreed in 2008, following social partner agreement between the CBI and TUC. These will come into force in the UK on 1 October 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will give agency workers the right to the same basic employment and working conditions as if they had been recruited directly by a company, if and when they complete a 12 week qualifying period in a job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment Relations Minister Edward Davey said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The agency sector is a key part of the UK’s flexible labour market. It provides the flexibility needed for employers to meet surges in demand, cover temporary absences or cope with seasonal fluctuations and provides a route into employment for thousands of individuals.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Agency Workers Regulations have been on the statute book since January 2010 and followed negotiations between the CBI and TUC. We looked carefully at the possibility of amending the Regulations to address employers’ concerns but were forced to conclude that we could not do so without putting the 12 week qualifying period at risk. This qualification period is something that is a key flexibility that we know is vital to business.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our focus therefore has been providing the best possible guidance to help everyone affected understand these regulations. We have collaborated with key organisations including employment agencies, employers, trade unions and representative bodies to develop this guidance and I believe the resulting document will help prepare everyone for the forthcoming changes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the 12 week qualifying period, the key changes as a result of the Regulations include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key elements of pay. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Duration of working time. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Night work. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest periods and breaks, annual leave and paid time off for ante-natal appointments. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New Task Force for employee engagement</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron gave his backing to a new independent Employee Engagement Task Force launched today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading professionals from the public and private sector joined the Prime Minister and Business Minister Edward Davey alongside the Chair of the Task Force, David MacLeod, at Number 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force will ensure that there will be opportunities for organisations wanting to learn about engagement. It will share good practice, generate debate and offer support via a new website, details of which will be announced shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It builds on the report &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file52215.pdf"&gt;‘Engaging for Success’&lt;/a&gt;, which David MacLeod and Nita Clarke produced in 2009 for BIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This taskforce has my full support because I know that it will work to bring together two of my government’s top priorities - delivering sustainable growth across the UK, and coming up with new approaches to help people improve their wellbeing.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the public and private sectors can learn a lot from each other. This initiative fits well with our agenda of devolved power and authority and shows how effective companies can be when they feel empowered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that the Employment Engagement Taskforce has come together to develop practical ways to help all employers learn from the best, to break down barriers to engagement and to raise the profile of this whole agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="next-steps"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force will work with leading academics, practitioners and think tanks. It will report back next year on the strategies it recommends that organisations should adopt to promote best practice and learning.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also tackle key issues identified in the MacLeod Review such as barriers to wider adoption of engagement, how to harness engagement for innovation, and how to maintain morale through difficult challenges such as downsizing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sickness absence system to be reviewed</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;amp;post=60723"&gt;In a speech,&lt;/a&gt; delivered as the Government’s Welfare Bill was announced, the Prime Minister David Cameron has announced &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/welfare-reform/sickness-absence-review/"&gt;a review into sickness absence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jointly chaired by David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce and Dame Carol Black, National Director for Health and Work, the review will explore radical new ways on how the current system can be changed to help more people stay in work and reduce costs.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting later this year, the review will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore how the current sickness absence system could be changed to help people stay in work, reduce and share costs for the taxpayer and businesses, and contribute to economic growth. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine whether the balance of these costs are appropriately shared between individuals, employers and the State. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make tangible recommendations for change. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure that recommendations for change are consistent with promoting private-sector growth and minimising burdens on business - in particular small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the current system employers bear the costs of short term sickness with the State, and ultimately the taxpayer, absorbing the cost of longer-term ill-health, with over 300,000 people leaving work to claim sickness-related benefits each year - making up around half the total flow on to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review, which is jointly sponsored by &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/"&gt;the Department for Work and Pensions&lt;/a&gt; and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, will include a panel of experts from business, trade unions and health representatives and will be conducted in the context of the Growth Agenda.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also feed into the wider Employment Law Review, which is looking at measures to reduce red tape and remove the burdens on business, encourage growth and maximise flexibility for employers and employees.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment Relations Minister Edward Davey said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an important review which will help tackle the problems faced by business and individuals. Managing sickness absence more effectively will be a win-win situation for all - businesses, individuals, the taxpayer and crucially, the economy. It could improve productivity, boost growth and mean that many more people no longer have to rely on taxpayer handouts.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sickness absence undoubtedly has a huge impact on businesses - particularly on smaller firms that struggle with the processes and procedures required, not to mention the direct costs involved. The private sector must focus on growth if we are to sustain the recovery, so it is right that the Government has chosen to look at ways to reduce sickness absence in the workplace and get people back into employment.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to working with Dame Carol Black to reduce the unsustainable bill on both employers and the state caused by sickness absence, and making radical recommendations to achieve this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="additional-funding-for-health-and-work-programmes"&gt;Additional funding for health and work programmes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also announced today is an additional £12 million of funding for programmes including the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/health-work-and-well-being/our-work/fit-for-work-services/"&gt;Fit for Work Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/health-work-and-well-being/our-work/oh-adviceline/"&gt;Occupational Health Advice lines&lt;/a&gt;. Both have already proved highly successful in providing support for both employers and individuals in the early stages of sickness absence.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fit for Work Services bring together support such as healthcare, employment, skills, housing and debt advice, and will benefit employers, employees, and in turn the taxpayer by reducing pressure on general practice and other health-related services.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national Occupational Health Advice lines are valued by employers and provide practical occupational health advice for small and medium-sized businesses on handling individual employee health problems at work. &lt;/p&gt;
