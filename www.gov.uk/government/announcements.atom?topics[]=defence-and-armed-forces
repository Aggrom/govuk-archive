    <title>UK forces' contribution to Libya campaign</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a media briefing held earlier today, 27 October, in the Ministry of Defence Main Building, Air Marshal Peach began with a brief narrative of the operation recalling that, in February, as a result of the deterioration of the situation in Libya, there was quite a lot of work for Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) to do in terms of getting entitled persons out of the country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to say about that is to say thank you to the government and the people of Malta for letting us form a base there. In terms of geography, that gave us a special advantage to deal with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PJHQ, under the Air Marshal’s command, is a high-readiness group of people, ready to deploy rapidly around the world when something happens. In this case, they formed a non-combatant evacuation coordination cell, and by doing this avoided the situation where potentially three different countries could have sent three different aircraft in a disorganised way to pick up the same group of people: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a very soft attempt to coordinate across a group of nations who were all trying to do the same thing,” said the Air Marshal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was very successful. It was quite a tough call. We took a risk on the Sunday in particular, when we went deep with a C-130 into the desert. It was uncertain because of the number and nationality of the people there kept fluctuating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the same objective, Type 22 frigate HMS Cumberland was then moved into Benghazi harbour, which the Air Marshal also described as very uncertain at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it was a very successful part of the story, we evacuated 1,400 people out of a total of 4,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An added advantage gained from this operation, known as Op DEFERENCE, was that it built up knowledge of the country and provoked some thinking about what might happen next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were a bit surprised at how quickly things moved on,” said the Air Marshal. “We had the USCR 97 at the end of February, the National Transition Council established 5 March and then the no-fly zone was established. In quick time, some very successful operations were developed leading up to the hand over to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost a maritime embargo was established in which the Royal Navy played a key role with a number of ships and people who understood very well command and control in these situations and how to do boarding and embargo operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The influence of UK officers and men and women in command and control throughout this operation is something we should pay tribute to,” said Air Marshal Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A no-fly zone was quickly established. Having been personally involved in four of these in previous times, the Air Marshal said that, “we know how to do that.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO then took over, naming the operation ‘UNIFIED PROTECTOR’, and set up its HQ in Naples, a traditional NATO control centre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the important features of this operation is the harmony and the importance of the role of Italy,” said Air Marshal Peach, “harmony because the Italian military authorities have been extremely good hosts for the UK, and the importance of the geography is pretty obvious. The amount of support they gave us, bases, fuel, logistics, command and control was and is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In supporting civilians who were being “quite aggressively killed by the Libyan forces,” Air Marshal Peach said that what he wanted to highlight above all was the importance of the precise application of force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We judged, and I continue to judge, that unnecessary damage, or worse, the causing of civilian casualties would be a strategic liability for the campaign. The discipline of the ship, aircraft and helicopter crews are something I want to record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with NATO partners, Apache attack helicopters were introduced, mounted from HMS Ocean, to provide a useful tactical capability and, at the request of the NTC special advisers, “not Special Forces,” were introduced and who played a useful role in supporting the NTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key military objective at this point in addition to protecting civilians from pro-Gaddafi forces was reducing the command and control of the regime to stop the attack on their own people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding what was going on inside Libya was a key task throughout, not just along the coastal strip but deep inside the country as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also had some unusual tasks,” said Air Marshal Peach, “which I would not have predicted - for example, guarding Libyan dinars contained in a RAF C17 flown into Benghazi to get the money flowing; done, for obvious reasons, in complete secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Army Air Corps Apache and United States Air Force HH60 helicopters on board HMS Ocean, supporting Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR in the Mediterranean " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5335/UK_forces__contribution_to_Libya_campaign-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Army Air Corps Apache and United States Air Force HH60 helicopters on board HMS Ocean, supporting Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR in the Mediterranean  [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Guy Pool, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Gaddafi regime fell back on traditional homeland areas the fighting in and around Sirte was very difficult as the need for the disciplined application of force was more important than ever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point after all this investment of effort, we were not going to spoil it by being wanton in the application of force. So a number of times we held back, we held off, we made sure that the rules of engagement were strictly followed,” said Peach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have now reached the point where we are continuing to support operations awaiting direction from the North Atlantic Council, which we expect in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The themes and lessons that have been identified by PJHQ include precision in the use of weapons which has been, the Air Marshal felt, world class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The accuracy, the consistency, and the predictions of the serviceability of our weapons has been confounded. The British weapons in particular have been world class. The low collateral damage of Brimstone is at the top end of anybody’s inventory in the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this precision, the Air Marshal argued, was not just because the bombs were good, but because of the ways in which the ships crews and the air crews are using and interpreting the rules of engagement, using their weapons in a disciplined way, guided by the AWACS aircrews operating 24-hours-a-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The helicopters that deployed provided the ability to go as deep as 50 miles (80km) inland against a series of military targets. Video footage shows a crew taking out a target with two hellfire missiles; the second being fired and destroying the vehicle after those on the ground had been given time to flee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At no point,” said the Air Marshal, “have British servicemen targeted individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tornados carried British-designed and British-built Brimstone missiles, which proved to be a world class weapon system. The Tornado, although undeniably an old platform, is bang up to date in terms of what’s going on inside the cockpit as far as control software, intelligence and reconnaissance is concerned, the Air Marshal said, and he also praised the ground crews who worked round the clock to make sure the aircraft kept flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a new aircraft is the Typhoon, and the Air Marshal said the aircraft had been adapted to carry weapons such as laser-guided bombs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained that the complimentary way Typhoons worked alongside the Tornados, using their targeting pods to create additional intelligence and reconnaissance, was very important: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Typhoon has been a great success on this operation,” he said. “We have also been very pleased with the way that the Army Air Corps adapted to life on the ocean wave aboard HMS Ocean; a first for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Marshall Peach closed by saying that the UK did not do all this alone, and that the success of the operation had depended on the input of 19 partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-forces-transfer-responsibility-for-security-in-sangin-to-us"/>
    <title>UK forces transfer responsibility for security in Sangin to US</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transfer of authority, first announced by the Defence Secretary in July this year, is the last move in the current rebalancing of ISAF forces across Helmand. It follows an increase in ISAF and Afghan security forces in Helmand over recent months and will ensure an equal distribution of ISAF forces amongst the Afghan population living there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handing over Sangin will allow UK forces to focus their effort in central Helmand where they will continue to deliver effective counter-insurgency operations, working alongside the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces have been in Sangin, a key economic and transport hub, since 2006. Alongside the ANSF, they have provided vital security for the local population on behalf of the Government of Afghanistan, enabling development and preventing the insurgency from using Sangin as a base from which to mount attacks across Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 Commando Royal Marines, currently deployed with 4th Mechanized Brigade, have handed over to the US Marine Corps (USMC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British forces have served in Sangin over the last four years and should be very proud of the achievements they have made in one of the most challenging areas of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The level of sacrifice has been high and we should never forget the many brave troops who have lost their lives in the pursuit of success in an international mission rooted firmly in our own national security in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The handover of Sangin by UK forces represents sound military rationale and reflects the increase of both ISAF and Afghan forces across Helmand over the course of the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops will redeploy to central Helmand in support of ISAF’s main effort, where they will continue to lead the fight against the insurgency and assist in building a stable and secure Afghanistan that can stand on its own two feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Gordon Messenger, the Chief of the Defence Staff’s Strategic Communications Officer, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops redeploying from Sangin are handing over a strong, forward-looking operation which has, over the last four years, ensured that the authority of the Afghan Government exists even in an area that the Taliban regard as their heartland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our troops operating in Sangin have been taking the fight to the Taliban and by doing so have reduced the threat of violence spreading elsewhere. The progress and momentum in central Helmand would not have been possible without their endeavour and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is and will continue to be a challenging area because of its strategic importance to the Afghan Government, ISAF and the insurgency - that is why ISAF forces will remain there to build upon the progress already achieved by UK forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A member of the Police Mentoring Troop during a routine patrol around Sangin's bazaar " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5333/UK_forces_transfer_responsibility_for_security_in_Sangin_to_US-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A member of the Police Mentoring Troop during a routine patrol around Sangin's bazaar  [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Si Ethell, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The transfer of responsibility for Sangin to the USMC is the latest in a series of practical and sensible reconfigurations that have occurred as a result of the significant uplift in ISAF troops in Helmand over the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It allows British forces, with their Danish and Estonian allies, to focus their efforts in the critical central Helmand area, building on the strong momentum that has already been achieved there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Richard Mills, Commander of Regional Command (South West), the military headquarters responsible for Helmand and Nimruz provinces, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UK forces have carved out a solid security bubble that we are moving US forces into. They are leaving solid professional relationships with the people and the ANSF in Sangin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will continue to build on the successes and continue to work with the local population and forces there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being an economic and transport hub, power lines route through Sangin, supplying power from the Kajaki hydroelectric station to central Helmand and Kandahar, and Sangin is one of the most fertile areas in Helmand. Building and maintaining security and governance in Sangin is therefore vital for the long-term stability and development of Helmand and the wider region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sangin has moved forward since 2006 with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the reform of Sangin’s district governance with a new District Governor and senior staff appointed in March 2010. The new Governor is actively working with members of the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team and local community leaders to improve governance in Sangin and win the support of local tribal groupings, some of whom have previously supported the insurgency;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• over 850 shops trading in Sangin’s bazaar, twice as many as summer last year; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the improvement of Route 611 from central Helmand through Sangin to Kajaki - increasing access to agricultural land and markets for local people; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• local administrators, supported by the Provincial Reconstruction Team, working to distribute grain and promote the production of legal alternatives to narcotics; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• trained Afghan medics at the new health clinic, which opened in October 2009, treating 300 patients per week - men, women and children from Sangin and its surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, Commanding Officer of 40 Commando Royal Marines, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s been a hard fight for 40 Commando Royal Marines in Sangin, but we have achieved much. We have sought to protect the local people and have worked hard to support the Afghan National Security Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our partners in the ANA and ANP [Afghan National Police] have improved tremendously. They have provided the security for the District Governor to spread the influence of the Afghan Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bazaar itself, central to the economy of the area, is thriving and a much more bustling place than when we arrived with new shops opening all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is still work to do, and we are confident that our American partners will build on what we have achieved. We have lost brave Marines, but we will do them proud and return home with our heads held high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces will redeploy to central Helmand where they will join their British colleagues who are operating alongside Afghan and other ISAF forces and where the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team is carrying out major governance and socio-economic development projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Governor of Sangin, Mohammad Sharif, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The attitude, service and sacrifice that has been paid by the Royal Marines has been exemplary and has set a very good example for the people of Sangin. As 40 Commando goes, they will be missed by the people of Sangin and they will be in our thoughts and minds forever as we will always remember their hard work and efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces support Afghan operation in Lower Gereshk Valley</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operation BIG FISH was planned at a meeting of Afghan security officials including the District Governor and the Chief of Police, which was attended by the Commander of Task Force Helmand, Brigadier Doug Chalmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security shura meets regularly to discuss the district’s security priorities and the allocation of police and army resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Rupert King-Evans, Fire Support Company Commander, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The operation was to clear insurgents, IED components and IED-making facilities from the Lower Gereshk Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key point from this operation is that it was an Afghan operation supported by ISAF, and not the other way around. The Afghans planned the operation. We offered advice and, when they requested, we provided support for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task fell to the Afghan National Army (ANA) 3/215 Brigade, led by Brigadier General Sherin Shah. At dawn on the day of the operation, more than 400 Afghan warriors from the brigade flew into the contested area. By conducting several ‘dummy’ landings at various locations, the insurgents were kept on the back foot, and the Afghan forces achieved the element of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan warriors, accompanied by their British advisors, patrolled up the valley, clearing the area of insurgents and searching compounds for weapons and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Major Nathan Love from a Kandak Advisory Training Team said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sheer mass of Afghan force on the ground was enough to deter the enemy and show the people that the Afghans are leading. The Taliban saw this and most of them decided not to fight, so the ANA were able to find 14 of their IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Afghan warrior sweeps for explosive devices during Operation BIG FISH" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5331/UK_forces_support_Afghan_operation_in_Lower_Gereshk_Valley-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An Afghan warrior sweeps for explosive devices during Operation BIG FISH  [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Afghan soldiers searching the area and keeping the local residents safe, it was a point of pride to be leading a major operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jawid Afghanyar, an ANA officer with the 6th Kandak, 3/215 Brigade, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have mine-defusing teams, infantry teams and many others bringing security and peace to the area. It has been a while since the Afghan National Security Forces have been in the area and the people now know that we will help make this area safe and secure, so the people here can continue their work in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British soldiers involved in mentoring the Afghan forces have seen them rise to a very high level of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major King-Evans concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s seriously impressive how well the Afghan Army is operating. They are really swept up. Their low-level tactics, skills and drills are excellent, and they conducted the operation almost as if they were ISAF themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They’ve shown the local population that the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan National Army and Police are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces praised as new command stands up in South West Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes, announced on 21 May, see Regional Command (South West), based in Helmand, overseeing Helmand and Nimruz provinces, while Regional Command (South) [RC(S)], headquartered in Kandahar, continues to control ISAF forces in Kandahar, Daykundi, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the majority of ISAF forces based in southern Afghanistan, the formation of the new headquarters permits commanders in the south to focus on geographically smaller areas, ensure greater partnering between the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and ISAF, and deliver the levels of security required for governance and development to continue to spread in the region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Richard Mills of the United States Marine Corps is in charge of the new Command. He leads a combined force of some 27,000 personnel, with units drawn from eight nations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a distinct privilege for all of us to stand up Regional Command (South West),” he said. “We are truly building on the outstanding work of all that have served here in Helmand and Nimruz provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The establishment of Regional Command (South West) is a natural military progression based on the number of troops serving here and the priority placed on Helmand and Nimruz provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the first time that the US Marine Corps has led an ISAF Regional Command. The British officers serving in my coalition headquarters as well as Task Force Helmand have brought invaluable experience and knowledge to the command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are partnered with ANSF at all levels and conducting joint operations throughout Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tough fighting remains,” he added, “but I see evidence daily of progress that will bring about lasting stability across southern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will be a significant year for the future of Afghanistan. Coalition forces, alongside our Afghan counterparts, will continue to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as it delivers legitimate governance, improved security and lasting economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant General David Rodriguez, Commander of ISAF Joint Command, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The establishment of Regional Command (South West) significantly increases the ability of the Afghan National Security Forces to partner with the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Mills praised the work of British forces in Helmand province:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I remain very much impressed by the momentum and achievements of RC(S) under General Carter,” he said. “My predecessors in the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the British troops of Task Force Helmand have distinguished themselves in the service of the Afghan people here. Because of their efforts, real and tangible progress is being made here every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional Command (South), led by Major General Nick Carter, will continue to direct ISAF operations in the provinces of Kandahar, Zabul, Uruzgan and Daykundi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 30,000 troops continue to operate in RC(S). No troops have been realigned during the formation of the new command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces help transform Helmand hospital</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than twelve months ago Gereshk District Hospital was in a poor state; all of the buildings were in need of urgent repair, there were no inpatients, the incinerator was broken, and medical waste littered the hospital grounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), working with a Military Stabilisation Support Team (MSST), has completed 23 renovation projects at the site in Nahr-e Saraj (North).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hospital is now one of the leading medical facilities in Helmand, able to provide treatment to a much larger number of patients from Now Zad and Sangin - more than 20km away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renovated hospital has a 24-hour accident and emergency ward, a maternity wing, and vaccination and dental clinics, as well as a drop-in service for more common ailments. All the services are free to patients thanks to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and non-governmental agencies, who manage the funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Abdul Latif is the Director of Health in Gereshk and has worked at the hospital for the last six years. He has worked closely with the MSST, PRT and GIRoA, and has been the driving force behind the renovation. All of the work has been carried out by Afghan contractors using local materials, and this has helped to boost the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Air Force Sergeant Karen Swallow is from the MSST, part of Task Force Helmand. She says the most significant change at the hospital has been in the maternity facilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Previously the maternity ward was what can only be described as a broom cupboard with two old beds side-by-side. Now, it’s a completely new building with up-to-date facilities giving privacy and respect to the women before, during and after their labour,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="nside the new maternity wing at Gereshk District Hospital " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5326/UK_forces_help_transform_Helmand_hospital-05.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;nside the new maternity wing at Gereshk District Hospital  [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Hamish Burke, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif says as a result they’re seeing more and more mothers at the hospital:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most women give birth at home, but now the new maternity wing offers an ante and postnatal care facility, waiting rooms and bathrooms, and we have three female midwives and one female nurse working at the hospital,” he explained. “Increasingly, more women are taking advantage of the improved medical care rather than risking having their babies at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only the medical facilities that have been upgraded. A new incinerator, designed and built by an Afghan contractor, has been put in place so surgical rubbish is no longer left lying around, posing a health risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kitchen, which previously had no electricity and little equipment, now has lights and utensils, allowing the chef to prepare and store food for inpatients and staff. A new well has also been installed, along with a parking area, a mortuary, a new footpath and repairs to the boundary wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrant Officer Class 2 (Artificer Quarter Master Sergeant) Mike Wright from the MSST said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything has been completed to a high standard by the local contractors, providing a much needed improvement to services for the people of Gereshk. Without the dedication of the staff here to their hospital, the projects there would not have been such a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those treated at the hospital include victims of road traffic accidents, gunshot wounds and mine injuries from either insurgent-laid improvised explosive devices or legacy munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding and better facilities mean that the medical care is no longer constrained to the hospital. Various outreach programmes are also run by the medical teams to ensure that provision is extended to the more rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every day nurses from our hospital travel out into the district taking vaccines and health supplies to those who are unable to reach us. These health workers also spread information about basic hygiene and how important it is. The advice spread by word of mouth reaches far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Latif and the staff are keen to further expand the hospital and provide even better access to facilities for the local people. Sergeant Swallow is confident this will be achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This project has been the greatest success project which I have been involved in during my time with the MSST,” she said. “Dr Latif and his staff are fully committed to making further changes to the hospital, improving its service in the future. It is obvious that this facility will be sustained well after ISAF troops have vacated Afghanistan, which makes it the success story it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK commits more troops to Balkans peacekeeping mission</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company of soldiers will be based in the UK, ready to deploy at short notice to the region if required as part of EUFOR (European Union Force) Operation ALTHEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation ALTHEA has the backing of a UN mandate and provides a military presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina to help maintain a safe and secure environment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the announcement, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This contribution reflects the UK’s strong political support for EUFOR Operation ALTHEA and our determination to help maintain a safe and secure environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the security situation in the region remains calm and stable, it is essential that we provide EUFOR with the necessary resources to perform the mission’s mandate in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EUFOR provides an important safeguard underpinning stability and ensuring that Bosnia and Herzegovina can continue to make progress on its path towards EU and NATO accession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pledge of more troops in support of Operation ALTHEA will not take place until December in order not to impact on the Armed Forces’ commitment to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR Operation ALTHEA became the legal successor in December 2004 to NATO’s SFOR (Stabilisation Force) mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EUFOR has the backing of a UN Chapter VII Mandate and its aim is to ensure continued compliance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the continuance of a safe and secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK forces help Afghan police hold community party</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 300 people from the local area attended the party, which was organised entirely by the Afghan Uniform Police (AUP), who also provided the security for the event - the largest gathering of its kind in the Babaji area of Lashkar Gah district for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment was in the form of a band and traditional Afghan food was provided and served to the guests by the AUP. The band had travelled from Lashkar Gah and many of the police present had also come from areas outside the Babaji precinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ‘community concert’ marks a milestone in the continued success of the police to provide security and influence in the area. Within the last few months several ISAF checkpoints have been closed or handed over to the Afghan police and the final transition of Babaji to Afghan control is due to take place later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Babaji bazaar, which has been closed for the last two years due to security concerns, has recently reopened - a sign that the local population now feel secure enough to return to a state of normality that has not existed in the region for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money for the event was provided by the Operations Coordination Cell (OCC), run by the Police Monitoring and Advisory Group, which is led by 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment (1 PWRR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Paddy Munns, from 1 PWRR, is the Officer Commanding of OCC Babaji, and in the run up to the event he assisted the AUP precinct commander with planning the concert and the necessary security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day, soldiers from Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment (1 YORKS), provided overwatch, but security at the event was provided solely by the Babaji AUP and the day went without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, dancing with Lieutenant Esmeri at the community concert  " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5324/UK_forces_help_Afghan_police_hold_community_party-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, dancing with Lieutenant Esmeri at the community concert [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Munns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This was a hugely successful occasion and provided a fantastic opportunity for the police to socialise with the local population and continue to build on the developing relationship between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A gathering of this size hasn’t happened in Babaji for over 10 years, so that is some measure of the success of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The community concert was an excellent opportunity for the AUP, and they did themselves proud by organising the event. The AUP mixed in with the locals - dancing, socialising and serving them lunch. It allowed the AUP to show the people of Babaji that they are professional, competent and are here to serve the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band was hired from Lashkar Gah by the AUP and given a police escort to the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mangal, the band’s frontman, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I usually play at weddings and have never performed at a police-organised party. This is the first time I have seen such an event in Babaji. This would not have been possible during the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those present were the Afghan Government’s interim municipal councillor Haji Abdul Gaffoor and Lieutenant Esmeri, the commander of the Babaji police precinct. Many of the local elders were also present, highlighting the influence of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those members of ISAF present at the concert entered into the spirit of the day with Major Craig Powers, Officer Commanding Support Company, 1 YORKS, encouraging Lieutenant Esmeri to join him and others dancing in front of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babaji is part of the Lashkar Gah district, the security for which is the responsibility of the Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group aided by Support Company from 1 YORKS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and Vietnam sign Defence Co-operation Memorandum of Understanding</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Astor of Hever, Parliamentary under Secretary of State for Defence, signed the MOU with Lieutenant General Nguyen Chi Vinh, Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of National Defence, at Lancaster House today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signing of this MOU follows on from the Strategic Partnership Declaration signed on 8 September 2010 by Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Pham Gia Khiem, and the UK Foreign Secretary, William Hague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Vietnam demonstrates the UK’s commitment to pursuing an active foreign policy with emerging powers around the world. The UK aims to make the Strategic Partnership a springboard to take our growing bilateral trade relationship to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Partnership Declaration demonstrates the breadth and the depth of our co-operation, including defence and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is looking to engage more closely with countries in South East Asia and the Defence Co-operation MOU signed today between Lord Astor and Lieutenant General Vinh is another example of this regional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that today’s MOU signing will further enhance the bilateral relationship and will aid the exchange of information in areas such as training and peace support operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Astor said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the opportunity to meet with Lieutenant General Nguyen Chi Vinh today and to sign the Defence Co-operation MOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We had fruitful discussions on a number of topics and hope that the MOU will help to facilitate a deeper level of co-operation between our two nations, enhancing the bilateral relationship envisaged in the Strategic Partnership Declaration signed in London last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK and US troops work together to train Afghan Police</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams from The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (5 SCOTS), and the 1st Marine Division of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) have been jointly responsible for the training of the ANP in Afghanistan’s Helmand province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canterbury-based 5 SCOTS, which recruits predominantly from central and western Scotland, are now in the final weeks of a seven-month deployment to Helmand province, during which time they have fulfilled the role of Police Development Advisory Training Team (PDATT) within Task Force Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Marines from the 1st Marine Division have formed a unit known as the Provincial Police Advisory Team (PPAT) and have worked alongside the 5 SCOTS troops, making improvements in police recruiting, training and operations throughout Helmand. Both the Jocks and the Marines are based in Helmand’s provincial capital Lashkar Gah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Colonel John Klink of the United States Marine Corps' Provincial Police Advisory Team with Lieutenant Colonel Adam Griffiths, Commanding Officer of 5 SCOTS " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5315/UK_and_US_troops_work_together_to_train_Afghan_Police-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Colonel John Klink of the United States Marine Corps' Provincial Police Advisory Team with Lieutenant Colonel Adam Griffiths, Commanding Officer of 5 SCOTS [Picture: Corporal Pete George, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the 5 SCOTS PDATT has had responsibility for policing in the key central Helmand districts of Nad ‘Ali, Nahr-e Saraj and the city centre and outlying areas of Lashkar Gah, the US Marines have worked on improving the capabilities of the provincial police headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this recent partnership, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum researched the regimental archives to establish whether there was any record of them working together previously and discovered that the then 2nd Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the US 4th Marine Regiment served together in Shanghai in China from 1932 to 1933.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Argylls were deployed to China as an emergency battalion to ‘protect the foreign area from internal disorder and to defend it against external aggression’, as their mission was given at the time. Shanghai was split into various defence sectors controlled by different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One was held by US Marines, at the time the 4th Marine Regiment. The Argylls took over a sector close to the Marines and liaison officers were established within each headquarters. Just as the Argylls and the USMC worked successfully together in the 1930s, the modern-day partnership has seen great achievements in Helmand. Confidence amongst locals in the Afghan Police has evidently grown and the ability of the police to conduct operations unaided against the insurgency in Helmand has improved markedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ANP are now taking on more and more responsibility for providing security, as well as normal day-to-day policing, in the populated areas of Helmand, from the US and UK troops based there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subtle yet critical development in the campaign against the insurgency has been increasingly to view IED emplacement and other acts of violence against UK, US and Afghan troops as criminal acts rather than acts of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewing them this way puts the emphasis on the Afghan Police to take primacy in the counter-insurgency effort. As such, crime scene exploitation, evidence-handling, and deeper understanding of powers of arrest and detention are now the focus of training the police and mentoring them on their day-to-day operations. Lieutenant Colonel Adam Griffiths, Commanding Officer of 5 SCOTS and the man responsible for leading the PDATT’s efforts throughout the deployment, commented on the work his battalion has done with the US Marines throughout the tour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This has very much been a joint effort working closely to develop the capacity of the ANP and, in particular, the Afghan Uniformed Police,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen demonstrable change over the past seven months and both the Jocks, in the form of the PDATT, and the Marines, as the PPAT, have worked hard to improve the accountability, sustainability and professionalism of the police here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience working with the US Marine Corps. Our antecedent regiments have history working together and it has been a joy to rekindle that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To acknowledge the work done together during this tour of Afghanistan, Lieutenant Colonel Griffiths presented each member of the USMC PPAT with a ‘Glengarry’, the traditional formal headdress of the Scottish infantry soldier worn on ceremonial occasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, Colonel John Klink of the USMC PPAT presented the Argylls with their divisional insignia and a USMC badge of rank, representing each of the 5 SCOTS soldiers’ and officers’ own rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the reasons behind the recent success of the ANP in Helmand, General Hakim Angar, Helmand Chief of Police said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The foremost reasons are training and education. Now policemen better understand what is required of them and how to deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have imposed strict discipline amongst our ranks and have rooted out practices which are contrary to the law. As I tell the people of Helmand, ‘the police and the people are one’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and US navies compare training for Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six Royal Navy instructors who visited America last week are based at the Pre-deployment Training and Mounting Centre in Portsmouth. They met their American counterparts at the US Army’s combat training centre at Fort Jackson in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to length of deployment and type of training, the US and the UK have their own ways of doing things and it was hoped that this visit might provide a knowledge-sharing opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Portsmouth most of the instructors are Royal Marines with operational experience, whereas the US Navy sailors are taught by the Army at one of eight military bases across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK around 1,000 sailors are trained every year as Individual Augmentees (IAs) who deploy to Afghanistan on a one-in-one-out basis, whereas in the US the total is nearer 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IAs can be sailors trained in a wide range of skills such as logistics, admin, intelligence or operations, and are able to join units already based in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK the maximum deployment period is six months, whereas in the US it is up to a year. In both cases sailors may be required to provide support to bases on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both countries are keen to learn from each other, the ultimate goal of the training is exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="American sailors participate in the US Navy Individual Augmentee combat training course at Fort Jackson, South Carolina " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5309/UK_and_US_navies_compare_training_for_Afghanistan-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;American sailors participate in the US Navy Individual Augmentee combat training course at Fort Jackson, South Carolina  [Picture: Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class R Jason Brunson, US Navy 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six Royal Naval instructors who visited Fort Jackson, officer-in-charge of the Portsmouth Mounting Centre, Lieutenant Commander Pat O’Callaghan, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The courses both run on the exact same principle - to get the sailors up to the standard that is required to work with land forces on the ground in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our course is slightly longer than the US, but they both cover all the fundamental aspects of pre-deployment training - cultural awareness, counter-IED, weapon-handling, medical trauma treatment, and how to protect themselves while on foot or vehicle patrols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There were a few differences on both sides - for example we use real life amputees in our scenarios whereas they use mannequins, but the US have a very good administrative system when it comes to issuing kit which we think we may also incorporate into our practices here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a navy’s traditional role involves working with ships on the water, a deployment to Afghanistan can be challenging for some IAs. Lt Cdr O’Callaghan said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is something brand new for them. They are no longer on their ships and are instead drawing on all their military skills to survive out on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mounting Centre in Portsmouth trains groups of 80 personnel 12 times a year to ensure a constant rotation in the main operating bases in Afghanistan, the forward operating bases, the headquarters in Kabul and for those mentoring the Afghan National Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first two weeks the sailors take part in SA80 rifle training where they must produce consistently tight grouping on their targets at a range of 300 metres both in normal daylight and reduced light at night - the same requirement as that of Army personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once issued with their weapon, each serviceman must make sure they are confident with all the handling aspects by repeatedly stripping, cleaning and firing the rifle as it will be their constant companion for the duration of their tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the intensive two-week weapon course, each group is then taught vital survival skills such as a smattering of the local language, medical trauma treatment, an understanding of IEDs and mines, and also how to protect themselves on foot or vehicle patrols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week then follows at Longmoor training camp in Hampshire where the sailors put their newly-learnt skills into practice on exercise around a makeshift forward operating base - taking part in foot and vehicle patrols, coping with constant ambushes, and returning fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and US Defence Secretaries meet</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a press conference following yesterday’s meeting Dr Fox said issues covered in his meeting with Mr Gates included progress in Afghanistan, the upcoming Strategic Defence and Security Review, reform of NATO and nuclear weapons in Iran. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox and Secretary Gates both reinforced their commitment to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox said he thought hard about the issue before accepting the position of Defence Secretary last month, concluding there is still a national security imperative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that we cannot afford Afghanistan to lapse back into a failed state which will create a security vacuum which will contaminate the region and possibly well beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are committed to seeing it through to a resolution. By that I mean creating a stable enough Afghanistan to manage its own internal and external security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox said British troops would stay until Afghanistan was ‘stable enough’ to ensure internal and foreign security and the nation was run by the Afghans for the Afghans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questioned whether British forces would move from Helmand to Kandahar at some point in the future Dr Fox said that UK forces had built up a strong understanding of the terrain and personalities unique to Helmand and that a move to Kandahar would be ‘quite a leap’ which would also incur a large cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He concluded that it would therefore be ‘highly unlikely’ that any such move would happen and it is not something the UK Government would be proposing or indeed something that ISAF Commander, General Stanley McChrystal, has proposed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he added that the nature of the effort would inevitably change over time, with Secretary Gates making clear that July 2011 was the US target for the beginning of military withdrawal, dependent on ‘conditions on the ground’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary Gates paid tribute to the British contribution to the ISAF effort in Afghanistan and said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;British troops are demonstrating incredible courage on the battlefields of southern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I told Dr Fox how much we in America appreciate his nation’s leadership in this effort and I offered my condolences for the nearly 300 British troops who have been lost in the conflict, including several just this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To paraphrase a poet from the Great War, British fighting men and women have more than done their bit and… had their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Liam Fox, with his US counterpart, Robert Gates, at Lancaster House in London  [Picture: Harland Quarrington, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary Gates said that the international community would have to stay committed to the country for many years to come, with civilian support increasing as the need for foreign combat troops becomes less acute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran was also a key feature of the discussions. Mr Gates said he was hopeful the United Nations Security Council would pass a resolution designed to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons ‘very soon’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Fox was also optimistic in that regard and warned that if Iran were to become a nuclear power it would destabilise the entire region and ‘may well be the end of the NPT [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty] as we know it’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dr Fox said a new UN resolution backed by the entire global community would demonstrate to the Iranian leadership how ‘serious’ the situation was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both men also said that they agreed on the need for reform of NATO and would work together to achieve their aims in this area and Dr Fox said Britain would take lessons from the US when it decides on the future of Defence in the Strategic Defence and Security Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and Italian Defence Ministers meet</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Liam Fox and William Hague met with Italian Defence Secretary Ignazio La Russa and Foreign Minister Franco Frattini to highlight the UK’s appreciation for Italy’s contribution in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Italian national main effort is to support ISAF with over 3,000 personnel in Three Task Forces and, as part of the reinforcement promised by the end of 2010, an additional Task Force will be deployed to southern Afghanistan, taking the manning total to 4,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deployment has already started - one Company has arrived in theatre and is conducting familiarisation training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thanks in part to this uplift that commanders on the ground have been able to rebalance the forces in Helmand province, including the eventual redistribution of UK troops from Sangin.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy is also deploying some additional Carabinieri to Afghanistan to strengthen police mentoring and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2010, Italy will be the fourth largest contributor (with France) to ISAF, with almost 4,000 troops deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s wide-ranging discussions included agreeing the importance of the outcomes of the Kabul Conference made earlier this week and investigating how progress can be made in the mission in Afghanistan over the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also discussed the UK/Italian trade relationship. Italy is one of Britain’s largest trading partners, particularly in the defence industry sector, and will be an important partner in the commitment towards inward investment which is at the heart of the UK’s economic recovery plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK and French ships rendezvous off Libyan coast</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy’s helicopter carrier, and her French counterpart, Mistral, a Marine nationale (French Navy) projection and command ship, are both operating attack helicopters as part of the NATO-led Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR, enforcing UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973 to protect Libyan citizens. Mistral recently took over operations from her sister ship Le Tonnerre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy signed the Defence Co-operation Treaty in November 2010, it was not expected that the opportunity would present itself quite so quickly to be able to practically demonstrate the two nations’ armed forces working more closely together, as a way of improving collective defence capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Navy and Marine nationale ships have been involved in operations off Libya since the start of the operation earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, there has been close coordination on attack helicopter maritime strike missions, and both HMS Ocean and Mistral have each embedded a liaison officer onboard the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been a number of visits between the Command teams in order to further understand how the other operates, further contributing to the aim of having, by the early 2020s, the ability to deploy an integrated British-French carrier strike group, incorporating assets from both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since having been allocated to the mission in late June 2011, HMS Ocean has had several intensive periods at sea, launching embarked Apache Attack Helicopters from 656 Squadron Army Air Corps into Libya in support of the NATO-led operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apaches have been ably assisted by other helicopters embarked on HMS Ocean, namely Sea King Mk 7s of 857 Naval Air Squadron, providing maritime surveillance, and Lynx Mk 7s of 847 Naval Air Squadron, providing force protection and logistic support. Together, the Apaches and Sea King Mk7s have flown a significant number of operational sorties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since leaving the UK in late April 2011, HMS Ocean has conducted over 2,000 deck landings by both embarked and visiting aircraft. This has included French Pumas flying from the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, as well as both the amphibious ships Le Tonnerre and Mistral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Ocean left the UK in April 2011 as part of the UK’s Response Force Task Group to conduct a series of pre-planned amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean, known as Cougar 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the escalating events in Libya, the UK Government took the opportunity in May 2011 to re-task one of the most flexible ships in the Royal Navy’s inventory, and ordered HMS Ocean to support the enforcement of UNSCR 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to HMS Ocean, the other Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships taking part in this operation currently comprise destroyer HMS Liverpool, mine countermeasures vessel HMS Bangor, and support ship RFA Fort Rosalie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Co-operation Treaty between the UK and France was drawn up to build upon commitments made in last year’s Strategic Defence and Security Review to create stronger strategic defence relationships with our main allies whose security interests and military capabilities are closest to our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>50-IED cache found by UK and Afghan troops in Helmand</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weapons haul, retrieved from two bomb-making factories in northern Nad ‘Ali, is one of the largest made during 16 Air Assault Brigade’s six-month tour, and came as the unit prepared to hand over command of Task Force Helmand to 3 Commando Brigade on Saturday 9 April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;38kg of explosives, rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers, bomb-making paraphernalia and drugs were among the items discovered during the joint Afghan National Army and UK operation, which also involved Estonian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military commanders believe the action will significantly disrupt the insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Matthew Cansdale, Officer Commanding the Brigade Reconnaissance Force, said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is some of the most sophisticated equipment we’ve seen, and we found a large amount of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It appears that these people were highly skilled operatives who no doubt supplied their equipment to people across Helmand. Had it been left in the hands of the insurgents, it could have had truly devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items either removed for analysis or destroyed by the ISAF and Afghan forces included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• more than 50 pressure plate IEDs &lt;br&gt;
• strips of detonator cord&lt;br&gt;
• improvised detonator initiators&lt;br&gt;
• improvised detonators&lt;br&gt;
• demolition charges&lt;br&gt;
• 38kg of homemade explosives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• RPG warheads&lt;br&gt;
• 1kg of drugs&lt;br&gt;
• a variety of live ammunition (5.56mm, 7.62mm and pistol rounds), and various tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Small arms ammunition rounds and casings seized at the bomb-making factories " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5291/50-IED_cache_found_by_UK_and_Afghan_troops_in_Helmand2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Small arms ammunition rounds and casings seized at the bomb-making factories  [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Removing IEDs before they can be laid and denying the insurgents IED-making equipment is key to bringing peace and security to areas like this,” said Major Cansdale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is extremely pleasing to know that this operation has reduced the threat to innocent locals and to our fellow soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghan and ISAF security forces have seized numerous weapons caches throughout Afghanistan since the beginning of the year. Joint patrols discovered most of the weapons caches in the southern part of the country.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to coalition forces, the weapons and bomb-making materials seized include more than 32,000 pounds (14,500kg) of ammonium nitrate, 40 pounds (18kg) of magnesium, 5,550 feet (1,700m) of detonation cord and wire, 400 mortar rounds, 150 land mines, 400 hand grenades, 60 RPG launchers with 260 warheads, and 200 pressure plates. Various small arms were also discovered, including 200 AK-47 assault rifles with nearly 40,000 ammunition rounds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caches yielded vast amounts of IED-making material, including blasting caps, saw blades, ball bearings, hundreds of pounds of shrapnel, and two 66-pound (30kg) barrels of homemade explosives, and suicide vests, various other explosives and unexploded ordnance were also removed from enemy hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>A soldier's life in Helmand's Green Zone</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeker is a relatively new checkpoint and packed with the latest technology to help the patrols get on the ground with as much intelligence and knowledge as possible. We also have BFBS [British Forces Broadcasting Service] TV and two internet computers and this gives us a good change to relax in the welfare tent that doubles up as a cookhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two B Company checkpoints aren’t as lucky but they get up about once a week and check their mail and chill out. With solar showers and toilets with a door (poo in a bag variety) this checkpoint is classed as a luxury here in the Green Zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are surrounded here by farms with deep irrigation ditches. These range from ones you can step over to ones that come up over chest height and you have to wade through. The banks are often very steep and it’s impossible to get out without being dragged out by your mates on your stomach because it’s so slippery and muddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locals are very happy that we are in the area and help us out by walking over the bridges to prove they have not got IEDs [improvised explosive devices] or putting down logs for us to make a crossing. This may be just to stop us walking in their crops but it strengthens our relationship with the locals and helps us with our patrols and shows who we can trust in the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mixed platoon, half from 2 RIFLES [2nd Battalion The Rifles] and half from 1 PWRR, the way we do things is the same as if we were all from the same unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We split patrolling and guards and duties so that when you come in off patrol you can do admin and make sure your kit is 100 per cent in working order. This is important for your body as well or it will start to go down and fatigue will set in and that leads to a harder time for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been quite quiet here and the locals are still busy with the harvest. But we must never let complacency set in. That said, on a recent foot patrol to a local village and after a shura (meeting with village elders) we headed north and, in a village in the south, 5 Platoon were moving away when they were fired upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contact was short but there was a lot of firepower used. We moved to support but 5 Platoon withdrew back to their checkpoint [CP].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in CP Jeker we checked ourselves over and no-one was hurt in the fire fight, but the insurgents had slipped away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropped in by helicopter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Private Graham 'T' Thurston " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5280/A_soldier_s_life_in_Helmand_s_Green_Zone2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Private Graham 'T' Thurston [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the winter closing in fast, it appears that the main fighting season is coming to an end. Patrolling is becoming easier; however selecting totally new routes to patrol is becoming more difficult as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent operation into a small village south of the River Helmand saw us patrolling into an area not previously visited by ISAF. We had heard that the village was being used by insurgents as a bed-down location and as an area to store weapons and IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were dropped into the village by helicopter which allowed us to move in quickly. We entered the village with three ISAF multiples and three ANA [Afghan National Army] multiples along with the Officer Commanding’s group, with me being in Sergeant Janes’ multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of soldiers on the ground which allowed us to quickly secure the outer compounds. With the ANA searching, we moved through the main group of compounds very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the ANA had completed their task, Sergeant Janes moved us to a bridge crossing; however as soon as we moved we thought we saw an insurgent scout running away. The ANA went in pursuit and soon caught the runner who was found to have IED components in his possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After talking to a local elder about the detainee, it was decided to send the man to Camp Bastion for further questioning. With all the moving parts working well, a lot of intelligence gained and one less insurgent to worry about, this operation was seen as a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the tour has gone on, Corporal Watson, an attachment from 5 RIFLES [5th Battalion The Rifles], has become very good at using the HIIDE [Handheld Interagency Identity Detection Equipment] biometric enrolment camera. As such we are using this kit to good effect on most patrols. In general the locals are happy to give up a few minutes of their time to be enrolled onto the system in order to help keep their community safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Private Graham ‘T’ Thurston serves with 5 Platoon, B Company, 1st Battalion The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment - known as the ‘Tigers’ - in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province as part of the 5 RIFLES Battle Group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-spin-cycle-that-is-saving-lives-in-helmand"/>
    <title>A spin cycle that is saving lives in Helmand</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one of the British Army’s latest generation of armoured vehicles is struck by an improvised explosive device, or rolls over on difficult terrain, the soldiers inside need to know how to protect themselves and safely exit the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two RODET units, which can simulate a vehicle rolling and coming to rest upside down or on its side, are in use at Camp Bastion (and eight further units in the UK/Germany), and every soldier likely to go ‘outside the wire’ experiences the delights of going for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Captain Dougie Douglas, the officer responsible for reception, staging and onward integration training at the huge base, the RODET is dramatically improving British soldiers’ chances of surviving a vehicle incident without suffering serious injury. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s the basic stuff - wearing seat belts, stowing equipment securely and keeping the vehicle clean inside. Some people are just about double their normal weight with their body armour and combat equipment on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the person opposite you gets thrown on top of you, or you get thrown out of your seat against the roof of the vehicle, you could be severely injured. Seat belts save lives, even in a combat zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment stowage is important, as items like boxes of ammunition can become projectiles inside a vehicle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We illustrate the point using foam rubber ammo boxes”, said Captain Douglas. “Being hit in the face by a rubber ammo box is simply a bit annoying - but if it was a real steel one, with 250 rounds of machine gun ammunition inside, that could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Roll Over Drills Egress Trainer or RODET  " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5276/A_spin_cycle_that_is_saving_lives_in_Helmand2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Roll Over Drills Egress Trainer or RODET [Picture: Sergeant Alison Baskerville RLC, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each RODET session includes the vehicle coming to rest at different angles, with the occupants being told to exit through a different door each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are techniques to be learnt, such as getting out of a four-point safety harness when hanging from what is now the roof without falling across the vehicle, and extracting a wounded or unconscious casualty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every move is watched by the operator using a series of night-vision cameras mounted inside the simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clean vehicle is a safe vehicle, even in the dusty wastes of Afghanistan, as RODET instructor Sergeant Andy Hale of the 9/12 Royal Lancers pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As soon as the hull turns over you can see all the dirt and gravel on the floor of the vehicle fly upwards. The same thing happens in an IED strike. The guys learn to keep their protective glasses on, even in the vehicle, but they still come out of the RODET with a face full of dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Captain Douglas, the RODET is a lifesaving investment that has already demonstrated its value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Soon after we started the training we had a Mastiff vehicle roll over on an obstacle on the driver training course, “ he said. “Everyone rushed over, expecting the worst - but the guys were just extracting themselves exactly as we teach them. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>A year of RAF Merlins in Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last 12 months the Merlins have proved their worth transporting troops and resupplying them with essential ammunition, food and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time they have carried almost 40,000 troops and lifted over 750 tonnes of freight, providing a significant increase to the UK military helicopter capacity available to battlefield commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Merlin Force consists of personnel from 28 (Army Co-operation) and 78 Squadrons. They work alongside the Chinook, Sea King, Apache and Lynx helicopters already supporting Operation HERRICK as part of Joint Helicopter Force (Afghanistan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before arriving in Afghanistan in November 2009, the Merlin Force had been deployed in Iraq.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Joint Helicopter Command, Rear Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Merlin aircraft from RAF Benson are contributing significantly to the stabilisation effort in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have been enormously impressed by all the personnel involved, both during their training and when deployed on operations. Our aircrew, ground crew, logisticians and engineers and their helicopters in theatre are doing amazing things in extreme temperatures and in the face of a very determined enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Mark Biggadike, Second-in-Command of 78 Squadron, commanded C Flight in Afghanistan earlier this year. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Troops embark on a Merlin helicopter at a patrol base in Afghanistan  " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5274/A_year_of_RAF_Merlins_in_Afghanistan2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Troops embark on a Merlin helicopter at a patrol base in Afghanistan [Picture: Senior Aircraftman Neil Chapman, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It was a big challenge to get the aircraft from Iraq to Afghanistan but it was something that the Force as a whole rose to really well. It was also the first time I had commanded a helicopter detachment in quite such a hostile environment and it was good to see the Merlin making a difference in theatre - to the troops on the ground and indirectly to the overall effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think the Merlin performed very well during their first summer operating in Afghanistan, and in those conditions. Working with the other aircraft types and integrating with all three Services out there was a very positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s nice to see it work as well as it does; it means that the concept of joint operations is alive and well and is very successful - Joint Helicopter Force (Afghanistan) is a prime example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Merlin is an all-weather, day-and-night, multi-role helicopter used in both tactical and strategic operational roles; performing tasks in Afghanistan which include picking up casualties and flying resupply missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Merlin is able to carry a diverse range of bulky cargo, either internally or underslung, and has been transporting troops to and from forward operating bases and resupplying them with ammunition, food and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cargo can include artillery, Land Rovers or light strike vehicles, and over five tonnes of freight.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cabin can also accommodate up to 24 fully-equipped combat troops and, when required, will convert to carry 16 stretchers for casualty evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Action in Libya has prevented 'humanitarian catastrophe'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updating Parliament on the situation in Libya, the Foreign Secretary said that 34 nations are now providing a range of assistance and that, since Thursday, a total of 701 sorties and 276 strike sorties have been conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Ministry of Defence announced that yesterday, 5 April 2011, RAF Tornado GR4s again deployed from Gioia del Colle in Italy to conduct armed air reconnaissance and overwatch patrols over Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of this action, a number of Paveway IV and Brimstone missiles were launched at military targets in the areas of Misurata and Sirte. A total of 12 targets were hit - six armoured fighting vehicles and six battle tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Typhoon aircraft also flew from Gioia del Colle to police the no-fly zone, and two RAF VC10 tanker aircraft supported these operations, providing air-to-air refuelling.&lt;/p&gt;

This follows yesterday’s deployment of an additional four RAF Tornados to Gioia del Colle in support of the ongoing operation. The UK currently has 16 ground attack aircraft under NATO command. This meets present operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total number of UK fast jets deployed in southern Italy, including those under UK command on standby to support operations, currently stands at 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy continues to play a vital role in the NATO maritime element of Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR. HMS Brocklesby and HMS Cumberland are both enforcing the arms embargo on Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Hague said that the coalition has ‘all but eliminated’ the Gaddafi regime’s air defence capability and stopped it from bombarding Libyan cities from the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary also said that the coalition is destroying key regime military assets, including main battle tanks and mobile artillery, and that the arms embargo is being enforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Mr Hague warned that the regime is still able to inflict considerable damage on Libya’s civilian population using ground forces, and indeed is deliberately inflicting such harm, particularly in the towns of Brega, Misurata and Zintan, where the heaviest fighting is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So long as the regime continues to attack areas of civilian population, the coalition will continue military action to implement the UN Security Council Resolution,” Mr Hague said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Hague said that the UK is also one of over thirty nations contributing to the humanitarian effort in Libya. Food distribution is taking place at six locations in opposition-held areas in the east of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Hague said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The World Food Programme has over ten thousand tonnes of food positioned inside Libya and neighbouring countries, and hopes to reach 85,000 people. DFID [Department for International Development] is flying tents for over 10,000 displaced people from its stocks in Dubai to be distributed by the Red Crescent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Several consignments of medical supplies have been successfully delivered to Misurata, and yesterday a Turkish hospital ship was able to evacuate 230 wounded people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary said that a further British diplomatic mission has travelled to Benghazi, led by Christopher Prentice, and, while Britain is not engaged in arming the opposition forces, it is prepared to supply non-lethal equipment to help protect civilian lives and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Adaptability 'crucial component' of future infantry equipment</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the Modern Infantry Conference and Exhibition at Bisley in Surrey, Mr Luff said the quest for the right mix of mobility, protection and firepower will continue to drive infantry equipment acquisition. But added that there will also be differences as the Armed Forces are taken to the next level of fighting effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said there would be a new structure for the Army, new equipment, and a better way of acquiring and supporting that equipment, but that the crucial component would be adaptability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this volatile world, everyone in Defence - including the infantry - will need to be adaptable as the character of war continues to evolve,” Mr Luff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that the economic environment and previous problems with acquisition had posed problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to equip and support them to a first-class standard - which it’s my job to do - then you need a force structure that’s fit for the 21st century, and a defence programme which is affordable and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s precisely what the Strategic Defence and Security Review [SDSR] has started to do,” said Mr Luff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the Army, the vision is a force structure equipped to operate successfully across the range of possible conflicts we are likely to face in the coming decades.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Luff confirmed that by 2020 it is envisaged that the country would have a total trained Army of 112,000, of which roughly 70 per cent will be Regular and 30 per cent Reserves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That will require a reduction in regular manpower, and a potential increase of up to 10,000 trained reservists. Neither the reduction nor the growth is risk or challenge-free. But achieving this is essential if the Army is to adapt to life in a volatile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A British soldier with a new, up-armoured Warrior infantry fighting vehicle in Afghanistan " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5270/Adaptability__crucial_component__of_future_infantry_equipment2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A British soldier with a new, up-armoured Warrior infantry fighting vehicle in Afghanistan [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister said that the Army, including the infantry, will almost certainly need to engage more broadly overseas in conflict prevention, and be able to assist in relief operations and support the authorities here at home; and the Army’s equipment programme necessarily needs to remain fluid until the future Army structure is agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that the Army had often suffered from more ‘salami-slicing’ compared to the other Services due to Army programmes typically spending less time in development, and units are measured in the hundreds or even thousands rather than the longer term small unit programmes of the Navy and Air Force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is compounded because manpower levels - rather than warship numbers and fast jet fleets - are seen to be the measure of relative Army success or failure in any cuts to Defence,” said Mr Luff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that, although the campaign is far from over, the MOD has also to begin managing the legacy of Afghanistan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example, as we plan for the drawdown of combat operations, we are considering which Urgent Operational Requirement [UOR] vehicles should be brought into the MOD’s core equipment programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;UOR acquisitions have made a vital contribution to the success of Operation HERRICK, and they have typically been brought into service on or before schedule. But now the incoherence - in fact, downside - of UORs becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They were procured for ‘the War’, not ‘a war’. Hard-headed realism will be required as the Army considers how to marry its future core vehicle requirement against the fleets of vehicles already in service. And we must remember that the best must not be the enemy of the good. These are battle-proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Defence Reform, Mr Luff said that the Service Chiefs now have the power to deliver and will be held rigorously to account for doing so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the infantry specifically, the Minister conceded that there is a school of thought which believes that the infantry have been relegated to second-class citizens as governments prefer to use Special Forces, but added that he did not believe that’s true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We all recognise and value the increased role of Special Forces, but they have a specific role which relies on secrecy, stealth and surgical insertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A counter-insurgency strategy, on the other hand, requires boots on the ground: visible to the local community and engaging with them; visible to the enemy and destroying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that he recognises that the Army has not been well served over the last couple of decades, but, today, the view that’s reported back to him from Afghanistan is that the British infantryman has never been so well equipped, supported, and protected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s a message we need to take proudly to the British people. I don’t rest on these laurels and there are still plenty of enhancements to come. But the point is that the issues of real and serious concern have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On top of this, new equipment arriving in theatre will have adaptability at its very core. And core capability is precisely what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the examples of Foxhound and the updated Warrior fighting vehicle, Mr Luff said these were the future, now, and showed a capability that is ‘adaptability-heavy’:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe we can look at the infantry of today and the infantry of the future with greater confidence than has been the case for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He concluded by saying that Future Force 2020 is the ultimate goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Getting there will be difficult - at times painful - yet there is no alternative. But the SDSR provides our vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Additional RAF Tornado jets arrive in Italy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aircraft, flown by crews from RAF Lossiemouth, mark a significant increase in the RAF’s reconnaissance capabilities as part of Operation ELLAMY over Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the jets arrived fitted with a RAPTOR (Reconnaissance Airborne Pod for Tornado) device which enables the aircraft to provide detailed reconnaissance imagery over large areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a secondary function, the Tornado GR4 jets will also be available to boost the strike capability of NATO operations over Libya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of the four additional RAF Tornado GR4 jets touches down at Gioia del Colle air base in southern Italy " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5266/Additional_RAF_Tornado_jets_arrive_in_Italy2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the four additional RAF Tornado GR4 jets touches down at Gioia del Colle air base in southern Italy [Picture: Corporal Pete Devine, Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking from Gioia del Colle, Officer Commanding 2 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, Wing Commander Nick Tucker-Lowe, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The arrival of the additional GR4s will be a considerable boost to the already potent combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability that the Tornado GR Force already brings to Operation ELLAMY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To date, 2 (AC) Squadron have had huge success with the precise engagement of hundreds of targets and the collection of thousands of images which have provided valuable intelligence for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These additional aircraft will allow us to further increase our presence over the skies of Libya and ensure that we continue to protect Libyan civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crews from 2 (AC) Squadron, based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, have been operating the 12 Tornado GR4 aircraft already based at Gioia del Colle since May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also six Typhoon jets deployed alongside the Tornado GR4s, currently operated by personnel from 3 (Fighter) Squadron, RAF Coningsby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next few days the aircraft will be prepped for operations by the personnel of 906 Expeditionary Air Wing and take to the skies over Libya as part of Operation ELLAMY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
