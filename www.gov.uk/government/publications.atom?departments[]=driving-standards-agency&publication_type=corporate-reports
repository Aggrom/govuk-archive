    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>The Driving Standards Agency's (DSA’s) performance over the financial year, including how it met its service standards and other targets.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report accounts for &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s performance over the financial year, including the extent to which &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; met its service standards and financial targets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s structured around &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s business plan for the respective year and its key priorities for the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is addressed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;government ministers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Department for Transport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;other government departments and agencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;driving organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the media&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the general public&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The maintenance and integrity of the Driving Standard Agency website is the responsibility of the Accounting Officer; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012 to 2013, our main priorities will be to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer candidates a theory test appointment within 2 weeks of their preferred date, and keep 99.5% of those appointments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offer candidates a car driving test appointment within 9 weeks of their preferred date, and keep 98% of those appointments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve our customer satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increase the take-up of digital services to 85%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cut carbon emissions by improving efficiency of our buildings, and by not travelling or travelling in greener ways where possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;comply with the EU third driving licence directive by providing tests for new categories of motorcycles from 19 January 2013, and starting a periodic training programme for all driving examiners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launch an online service for businesses to book and manage practical driving tests and manage their business with us so they don’t have to do this by phone or post&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>DSA carbon management plan</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>This plan sets out the Driving Standards Agency's (DSA's) vision and targets for reducing carbon emissions by 2016.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2011 the government published a new set of environmental commitments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carbon management plan commits &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to a target of reducing &lt;abbr title="Carbon Dioxide"&gt;CO2&lt;/abbr&gt; by 25% by 2016, which would allow &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; to make potential savings of £2.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; has worked with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.com" title="Carbon Trust"&gt;Carbon Trust&lt;/a&gt; to develop this 5-year carbon management plan. It sets out &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;’s vision, baseline, target, projects, funding, governance and communications support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 5-year period &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; will monitor performance and update the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>DSA equality and diversity statement</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) diversity strategy outlines its current position on equality and diversity.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DSA recognises valuing and embracing equality and diversity is key to its continued success and a well motivated workforce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All staff and customers will experience fair and equal treatment which will not be influenced by their: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;age &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disability &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gender reassignment &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pregnancy and maternity &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;race (including ethnic or national origin, colour or nationality) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;religion or belief (including lack of belief) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sex &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sexual orientation &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marriage and civil partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;DSA encourages a situation where staff and customers are treated with dignity and respect. DSA believes in continuously evaluating its policies and procedures to help ensure they do not directly or indirectly adversely impact on staff or customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discrimination will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="equality-duty"&gt;Equality duty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSA will ensure it shows due regard to The Equality Act 2010 and the underpinning public sector equality duty to ensure we meet our equality duty. DSA understands how meeting this helps towards delivering equality of opportunity for all as well as meeting its key business objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes having due regard to the need to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act 2010 &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="recruitment"&gt;Recruitment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strongest indicators of an inclusive and fair system is the way DSA recruits. DSA will ensure its recruitment practices continue to meet the needs of its equality duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="responding-to-the-needs-of-customers"&gt;Responding to the needs of customers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSA will continue to recognise the benefits of its diverse customer base in assisting with the development of its policies and services. Understanding the diverse needs of its customers helps DSA to formulate policies and services to address these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="creating-an-inclusive-culture"&gt;Creating an inclusive culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure equality and diversity continues to be mainstreamed into policy development, business procedures and service delivery. This helps an inclusive culture, particularly by the way staff interact with each other and customers. This leads to a higher level of satisfaction and commitment and greater success towards meeting DSA’s objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
