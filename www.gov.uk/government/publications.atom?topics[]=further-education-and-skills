    <title>The Richard review of apprenticeships</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports the findings from an independent review, carried out by Doug Richard, on what an apprenticeship should be, and how apprenticeships can meet the needs of the changing economy. Recommendations include redefining apprenticeships, focusing with greater rigour on the outcome of an apprenticeship, and using recognised industry standards to form the basis of every apprenticeship. It also recommends ensuring that all apprentices reach a good level in English and maths before they can complete their apprenticeship, creating the right incentives for apprenticeship training through government funding, and encouraging greater diversity and innovation in training. Follows the call for evidence URN 12/914.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
