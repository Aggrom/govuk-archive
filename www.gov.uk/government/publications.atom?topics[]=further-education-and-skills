    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports the findings from an independent review, carried out by Doug Richard, on what an apprenticeship should be, and how apprenticeships can meet the needs of the changing economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations include redefining apprenticeships, focusing with greater rigour on the outcome of an apprenticeship, and using recognised industry standards to form the basis of every apprenticeship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also recommends ensuring that all apprentices reach a good level in English and maths before they can complete their apprenticeship, creating the right incentives for apprenticeship training through government funding, and encouraging greater diversity and innovation in training.
