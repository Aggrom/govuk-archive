    <title>This week at the Foreign Office </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h4 id="syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary outlined the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-remarks-at-the-friends-of-syria-meeting" title="Foreign Secretary remarks at Friends of the Syrian People meeting"&gt;immediate priorities for the Friends of the Syrian People&lt;/a&gt; at the meeting in Marrakesh this week. He said “Syria needs a political transition leading to an inclusive new government, with full executive authority. This is the course most likely to achieve stability in the country.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="international-human-rights-day"&gt;International Human Rights Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On International Human Rights Day Baroness Warsi launched the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-baroness-warsi-marks-human-rights-day" title="Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi marks Human Rights Day"&gt;UK’s campaign for election to the Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;. She said: “We believe in a Human Rights Council that can make its voice heard, even when the issues are unpopular or difficult to hear.” The Foreign Office marked &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/" title="16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence"&gt;16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&lt;/a&gt; ending on Monday with a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/post/37632415718/helen-pankhurst" title="guest post"&gt;guest post from Dr. Helen Pankhurst&lt;/a&gt; from CARE international. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="foreign-office-website-moves-to-govuk"&gt;Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-website-moves-to-gov-uk" title="Foreign Office website moves to GOV.UK"&gt;Foreign Office began publishing its news&lt;/a&gt;, speeches, policy, publications and corporate information on GOV.UK – the single home for all government services and information. Our travel advice and consular information, and our Embassy and High Commission websites will follow by March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea-dprk"&gt;Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-condemns-dprk-s-satellite-launch" title="Foreign Secretary condemns DPRK’s satellite launch"&gt;condemned the DPRK’s satellite launch&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday saying that the launch was a clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 because it involved the testing of ballistic missile technology. The Permanent Under Secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/north-korean-ambassador-summoned-to-foreign-and-commonwealth-office" title="DPRK Ambassador summoned"&gt;summoned the DPRK’s Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in London to the Foreign Office to make clear to the UK’s condemnation of the DPRK’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="parental-child-abduction"&gt;Parental Child Abduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New figures revealed that the number of parental child abduction cases dealt with by the Foreign Office has risen by 88% in under a decade. The child abduction section at the Foreign office launched a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/parental-child-abduction-is-a-worldwide-problem" title="Parental Child Abduction"&gt;campaign to increase understanding of the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-met-the-king-of-jordan" title="The Foreign Secretary met the King of Jordan"&gt;the Foreign Secretary met His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan&lt;/a&gt; they discussed the situation in Syria, the Middle East Peace Process and institute reforms in Jordan that would bring about greater political participation, transparency and economic opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that the Iranian investigation into the death of the blogger Sattar Beheshti whilst in custody had &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/iranian-investigation-into-detained-blogger-is-missed-opportunity-for-justice" title="Iranian investigation is missed opportunity for justice"&gt;failed to deliver justice&lt;/a&gt;. The Minister said: “The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="also-this-week"&gt;Also this week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington set out the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-europe-renews-uk-commitment-to-eu-enlargement" title="UK’s commitment to EU enlargement"&gt;UK’s commitment to EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister for Africa Mark Simmonds called for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-calls-for-an-immediate-return-to-civilian-rule-in-mali" title="UK calls for an immediate return to civilian rule in Mali"&gt;an immediate return to civilian rule in Mali&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt visited Libya to strengthen &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fco-minister-shows-continued-uk-support-to-libyan-people-on-trip-to-region" title="Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt visit to Libya"&gt;UK relations with the new Libyan government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minister for Africa Marks Simmonds &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-africa-hails-ghana-as-a-beacon-of-democracy-following-successful-elections" title="Ghana election"&gt;hailed Ghana as a ‘beacon of democracy’&lt;/a&gt; following successful elections.&lt;/li&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-for-europe-renews-uk-commitment-to-eu-enlargement"/>
    <title>Minister for Europe renews UK commitment to EU enlargement </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister gave a press briefing for European journalists today following his participation in the General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 11 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK remains a strong supporter of EU enlargement to all countries of the Western Balkans, Iceland and Turkey. I’ve just returned from the General Affairs Council in Brussels where I was pleased to have a long discussion on EU enlargement. Its conclusions make clear the EU’s continued support for enlargement. This is important, and a message that I hope will be heard clearly in the accession and pre-accession countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is good for the EU and one of the EU’s greatest achievements. The European Union, alongside NATO, has been an instrument of peace and reconciliation that has helped spread democracy and the rule of law across our continent, and helped make armed conflict between EU members unthinkable. At the same time an enlarged Single Market, another of the key success stories of the EU, has opened up prosperity and opportunity to hundreds of millions of people. An outward-looking approach and a continuing commitment to enlargement should be seen by all EU Member States as signs of strength and vigour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enlargement is also good for wider security and prosperity across the continent. The accession of new Member States helps promote security, stability and prosperity across Europe, based on a firm foundation of democracy, human and civil rights, and respect for the law. The focus on good neighbourly relations is particularly important for a region such as the Western Balkans which saw conflict only two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a respect for this firm foundation and its benefits which drives the UK’s scrutiny of progress and focus on conditionality. So the UK is clear that there will be no pause after Croatia’s accession. But equally there will be no movement without progress on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Foreign Secretary visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo in October. He set out clearly the UK’s support for each country’s EU future. But he stressed to the political leaders that they needed to take the necessary steps to deliver. I hope political leaders in all of the aspiring countries will do so and that we will see further progress being made towards the EU early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And the UK remains committed to Turkey’s EU membership. We strongly believe that this would contribute to Europe’s prosperity and security, and the EU remains the strongest lever for reform in Turkey. We are focused on making real progress on the accession process in 2013 and we fully support the Irish Presidency in their desire to open a new acquis Chapter during their Presidency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-affairs-council-and-general-affairs-council"/>
    <title>Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, and I will attend the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-russia-summit"&gt;EU-Russia Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the EU-Russia Summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. Whilst I do not expect conclusions to be issued, we will aim to ensure that this meeting, the 30th such summit, delivers concrete results for the EU in its relationship with Russia. The discussion provides an opportunity for the UK to steer the EU’s objectives for the Summit and to ensure discussion focuses on concrete achievable outcomes, such as: resolution of the Siberian overflight charges; movement on market reform; positive developments in the energy relationship; underlining Member States’ concerns on human rights and democratic standards; and a more effective Partnership for Modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="western-balkans"&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review the situation in the countries of the Western Balkans, in advance of the discussion of EU enlargement at the GAC the following day. This will be an opportunity to consider the latest developments in the EU-facilitated dialogue between the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo: the UK welcomes the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this and is keen to see further improvement in the relations between the two sides. There may also be some discussion of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the pace of reform has recently slowed and renewed progress is badly needed, as well as consideration of the situations in Macedonia and Albania. I do not expect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a discussion on Syria. Further to a UK drive to increase EU support to Syrian civil society, I anticipate that the EEAS will present its vision on how the EU can support civil society in coping with the consequences of the ongoing conflict and better prepare it for political transition. We also expect discussion on the relationship between EU Member States and the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. Having successfully amended the EU arms embargo (and sanctions package) by setting a three-month renewal period, we will make fresh arguments in support of amending the arms embargo ahead of the March 2013 deadline in a way that offers sufficient flexibility to increase practical support to the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may also take stock of recent events in Libya, including how to support the priorities of the new Prime Minister, Ali Zidan, and his government which has now taken office. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council may discuss events in Egypt following President Mursi’s 22 November Constitutional Declaration. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but we will argue for the EU to respond appropriately to the latest developments and clearly underline support for continued progress towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the Middle East Peace Process will focus on follow-up to the 29 November UN General Assembly Resolution, including the EU’s response to the Israeli decisions to build 3,000 new housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, to unfreeze planning in the area known as E1 and to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority. EU Ministers will also discuss facilitating a rapid return to credible negotiations in order to secure a two-state solution. We will reiterate our condemnation of the Israeli decision, underlining the threat this poses to the two-state solution, and stress the need to continue work to build on the May FAC conclusions. We will also emphasise the need for the US, with the strong and active support of the EU, to do all it can in the coming weeks and months to take a decisive lead and push the peace process forward urgently. Additionally the UK will stress the need to build on the Gaza ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons. The UK will support conclusions covering these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-us"&gt;EU-US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item has been re-scheduled from November’s FAC. Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama.  I expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy and a possible EU-US free trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
We also expect Ministers to agree conclusions on Ukraine and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council"&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a substantial agenda for the GAC in December. There is a legislative deliberation on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union; a presentation by the Commission on the Annual Growth Survey; Preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December; endorsement of the 18 month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece; and a discussion on Enlargement, covering all potential candidates and including the adoption of EU Common positions for the Accession Conference with Iceland. Due to the large agenda, I expect many of these items to be brief and I expect most of the discussion to focus on the preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December and on Enlargement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statute-of-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union"&gt;Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency hopes to secure agreement on a selection method for additional judges at the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union: we have not yet received the final proposal for this.  I remain concerned at the current backlog at the General Court, which is damaging to the interests of British business.  My priorities in the discussion will be: to ensure that there is proportionate common law representation among any additional judges; that the costs of additional judges are covered within existing budgets; and that the selection method provides the Court with the stability it requires to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-semester-and-the-annual-growth-survey"&gt;European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present key elements of the 2013 annual growth survey which can be found on the Commission’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual growth survey sets out the Commission’s views on the economic priorities for Europe for 2013, focusing on fiscal consolidation, promoting economic growth and employment. The survey, which represents the first stage of the 2013 European Semester, focuses on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures across the EU.  The European Semester is the EU-wide framework for coordinating structural reforms and growth-enhancing policies. We do not expect this item to be opened for substantive discussion but, in the event that it is, I will be supporting the focus on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-for-the-december-european-council"&gt;Preparation for the December European Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the December European Council will cover: economic policy, including Economic and Monetary Union and Banking Union; defence; enlargement; and foreign policy. The last two items are covered by the separate sections of this Written Ministerial Statement on enlargement and on the Foreign Affairs Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the European Council meeting will focus on agreeing a legislative framework for Banking Union and an agenda for further Economic and Monetary integration in the Eurozone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the December European Council the Prime Minister will seek to ensure the integrity of the Single Market at 27, including in the context of the Banking Union and the European Banking Authority. We will also press for further progress on growth and ensure that the timetable for further integration in the Eurozone progresses at the right pace and in the right way.  I will argue that these concerns should be addressed prior to the December European Council so that solutions to these issues can be put to leaders on 13 and 14 December.
The December European Council agenda item on defence will pave the way for further discussion in 2013.  I will argue for a focus on developing capabilities, enhancing operational effectiveness and strengthening the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-18-month-programme-for-the-presidencies-of-ireland-lithuania-and-greece"&gt;The 18-month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAC has been asked to endorse the 18-month programme of the Council. This sets out the combined programme for the Irish, Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies of the European Council covering the period January 2013 to June 2014. I expect the programme to be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enlargement"&gt;Enlargement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will seek to agree conclusions taking stock of progress on EU enlargement, and on the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans. The Commission released their Annual Enlargement Package on 10 October.  In this communication, the Commission recommended: (i) opening accession negotiations with Macedonia; and (ii) granting Albania candidate status subject to the completion of three specific measures and evidence of continued commitment in the fight against organised crime and corruption. We believe the communication to be a broadly fair and balanced assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek conclusions reconfirming the European Council’s support for EU enlargement and recognising that the accession process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform and reinforces peace, democracy and stability. We agree with the Commission’s view that closer relations with the EU should be based on the principles of delivery on commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality, and good communication with the public. We agree that key challenges remain for most enlargement countries, including in the area of the rule of law. We also support a focus on freedom of expression and regional co-operation, particularly for the Western Balkans countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out the Government’s views on the Commission’s reports in my explanatory memorandum of 18 October. We will seek Council conclusions welcoming Croatia’s continued progress towards meeting all of its commitments in full before its expected accession on 1 July 2013, while reiterating the Commission’s call for Croatia to sharpen its focus to ensure this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will seek conclusions that provide a fair and balanced assessment of Turkey’s progress, which will inject much needed momentum into the process to allow accession negotiations to move forward in 2013. I will argue that Iceland should be commended on the progress made in accession negotiations this year, while recalling the need for Iceland to address existing obligations, such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority under the European Economic Area Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also expect the Council to welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, while calling for early progress in the area of the rule of law, in line with the new approach to accession negotiations endorsed by the Council in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the FAC discussion of 10 December, the GAC will discuss the Commission’s enlargement package for the Western Balkans countries. We remain fully supportive of a future for all of the Western Balkans countries in the EU, once conditions are met. We want the European Council to commend good progress on reform in Macedonia through the High Level Accession Dialogue, and hope the European Council will be able to build on this by agreeing to the Commission’s fourth successive recommendation to open accession negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a further report from the Commission, the December European Council will not be in a position to grant candidate status to Albania; we will want it to call on Albania to make early progress on reform implementation and establish a track record on tackling organised crime and corruption to enable a decision in 2013. I will argue for Council conclusions that underline that Serbia still needs to make real progress to deliver a “visible and sustainable improvement” in its relations with Pristina before accession negotiations can be opened, while noting that this remains in reach if recent progress continues.  We want the Council to welcome the Commission’s assessment that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo is feasible and to signal that negotiations should begin as soon as possible.  We agree with the Commission’s assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on its EU agenda has stalled. We will want the Council to press the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress and deliver quickly on those issues they themselves have agreed to, for example, on the EU road map agreed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-single-market-centre"/>
    <title>UK Single Market Centre</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Single Market Centre brings together all the Single Market operational tools within a single team, including the Internal Market Scoreboard, SOLVIT (the problem solving mechanism that seeks to resolve the misapplication of rules by public authorities) and the Point of Single Contact (the online licensing service hosted on www.gov.uk for Services Directive Implementation). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key benefits of the Single Market Centre are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased awareness and confidence amongst UK businesses and consumers of the support available to trade and shop in the internal Market. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stronger links between Single Market policy and operations &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater visibility and focus within Government on improving the UK’s performance in implementing Internal Market measures &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-solvit"&gt;What is SOLVIT?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOLVIT is an informal problem-solving network that aims to provide a practical solution to a problem that arises with public authorities, where citizens and businesses exercise their free movement rights. The problem must concern the misapplication or misinterpretation of EC legislation, causing a denial of Internal Market rights for the applicant. There is a SOLVIT Centre in all EU Member States plus Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland that aim to solve problems within a short deadline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As SOLVIT uses an informal approach to resolving disputes, it cannot be used in situations where: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal proceedings, such as an appeal, are already underway &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The problem relates to a barrier established by legislation, as this cannot be resolved informally or within 
the deadline &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where deadlines under national law need to be respected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-point-of-single-contact-psc-"&gt;What is the Point of Single Contact (PSC) ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSC is an online E-Government portal that enables service businesses to research information on how to do business in a particular region or service sector within a specific European country and identify what authorisations they need in order to do business. The PSC also allows them to apply remotely for any authorisations or permissions needed, including making any payment electronically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-internal-market-scoreboard"&gt;What is the Internal Market Scoreboard?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internal Market Scoreboard is published twice a year. It was created to ensure effective implementation of Internal Market law within Member States. It does this by benchmarking Member States’ efforts and providing an overview of each Member State’ s enforcement performance. BIS is responsible for monitoring the Scoreboard in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Scoreboard each year, covers Directives that are not fully transposed in a Member State, and have a transposition deadline up to and including 30 April. The second Scoreboard covers those Directives that are outstanding in a Member State, with a transposition deadline up to and including 31 October. The Commission publishes the results of each Scoreboard in a report around 3 months afterwards and it is here that the Commission analyses the performance of each Member State and highlights those where performance has improved, or declined.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Secretary Written Ministerial Statement on the Balance of Competences of the European Union</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House that, further to my oral statement at the launch of the Balance of Competences Review (Official Report 12 July 2012, Column 468), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is today publishing the timetable for the review including departmental responsibility for the reports into each individual area of competence.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review will complete its work during 2014 and will look at the scope of the EU’s competences (the power to act in particular areas conferred on it by the EU Treaties) as they affect the UK, how they are used, and what that means for Britain and our national interests.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review will be divided into four semesters, each containing six to ten reports.  This will allow reports on related topics to be grouped together.   The reports from each semester will be published at the end of that semester.  If necessary, changes to this timetable will be made in order to take account of any events which could impact upon the timing of a report.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Semesters are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semester One:  Autumn 2012 - Summer 2013&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semester Two:  Spring 2013 - Winter 2013&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semester Three:  Autumn 2013 - Summer 2014&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semester Four:  Spring 2014 - Autumn 2014&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first semester reviews will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an overview on the Single Market;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;taxation;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;animal health and welfare and food safety;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;health;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;development; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foreign policy.     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Single Market encompasses such a broad area of competence that it is being split, with further reports on the four freedoms - goods, persons, services and capital - in semesters two and three.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Departments will take a rigorous approach to the collection and analysis of evidence.  The government department leading each review will, at the appropriate time, publish a Call for Evidence which will set out the scope of their report and include a series of broad questions on which they would like contributors to focus.The Calls for Evidence for first semester reports will be published shortly and will be available through the FCO website and through the website of the department leading each review.The reports into the first six competences will be published in the summer of 2013, along with the evidence received (subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government departments will consult widely, including Parliament and its committees, business, the Devolved Administrations, and civil society in order to obtain evidence to contribute to their analysis of the issues.  Our EU partners and the EU institutions will also be invited to contribute evidence to the review.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result will be a comprehensive, thorough and detailed analysis of where competence lies and what it means for the United Kingdom.  It will aid our understanding of the nature of our EU membership; and it will provide a constructive and serious contribution to the wider European debate about modernizing, reforming and improving the EU.The review will not produce specific policy recommendations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am placing the timetable in the Library of the House.It will also be published on the  &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/"&gt;Balance of competences review&lt;/a&gt; pages on Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office website.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK-Turkey relations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Spokesperson siad;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee (FAC) has published its report on UK-Turkey relations and Turkey’s regional role today. The report reflects the views of the Committee in line with its remit to examine the Government’s foreign policy. The Government will present its official response in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Foreign and Commonwealth Office welcomes the recognition given in the report of Turkey’s growing political and economic role on the world stage, and its analysis of ways to strengthen the UK-Turkey relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We also welcome the Committee’s endorsement of the Government’s steadfast support for Turkey’s EU accession, as an important element of the bilateral relationship. We believe that Turkish accession would be to the wider benefit of the UK and EU, contributing to our prosperity, security and stability. Turkey has made clear its firm strategic commitment to accession to the EU, and successive European Councils have made clear that Turkey is a candidate for full membership of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK is working closely with the Turkish Government, both bilaterally and with the EU to prepare Turkey for accession to the EU. In 2011/12, we have offered technical assistance on a range of issues, including freedom of expression, women’s rights, and judicial and public administration reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the Committee’s recognition of the strength of UK-Turkey ties. We work closely with Turkey on foreign policy issues critical to UK interests including Syria, the Iran nuclear issue, Somalia, Afghanistan and the Western Balkans. The Prime Minister has committed to doubling bilateral trade with Turkey over the next five years. Total trade reached £9.1 billion in 2011 - an increase of 40% since 2009. The government is committed to building on this success by raising awareness of market opportunities in Turkey amongst UK exporters, and tackling outstanding market access issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Committee has highlighted a number of concerns on human rights, particularly freedom of expression. We share the concerns expressed by the European Commission about Turkey’s human rights record, and we encourage the Turkish Government to take further steps to encourage greater freedom of expression particularly in the media. We welcome recent steps taken by the Turkish Government to reform its judicial system and look forward to further progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Committee also raised the Cyprus settlement negotiations, where we are committed to supporting the UN’s efforts to achieve a settlement based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality. “  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>EU Ministers agree further sanctions on Iran</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking today the Foreign Secretary said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s action demonstrates the EU’s growing concern about Iran’s nuclear programme, and our determination to increase peaceful, legitimate pressure on Iran to return to negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is action made necessary by Iran’s defiance of six UN Security Council Resolutions and its refusal to enter negotiations over its nuclear programme. Iran’s recent decision to commence 20% enrichment at its underground site at Qom shows that it continues to choose a path of provocation. This is an enrichment programme that has no plausible civilian use, in a site that the Iranian authorities hoped to keep secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call again on Iran to answer the serious questions raised by the International Atomic Energy Agency, to adhere to UN Security Council Resolutions and to suspend its enrichment programme in accordance with them. Iran has it in its power to end sanctions by changing course and addressing the concerns of the international community. We are ready to talk at any point if Iran puts aside its preconditions. Today’s sanctions show how serious EU member states are about preventing nuclear proliferation and pressing Iran to return to the negotiating table. We will urge other nations across the world to implement similar measures and to increase the impact of the measures the EU has adopted”.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-on-european-court-judgement-on-taxation-in-gibraltar"/>
    <title>Statement on European Court Judgement on taxation in Gibraltar</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On 15 November 2011 the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) published its judgment in appeal cases brought by the European Commission and Spain against the United Kingdom and the Government of Gibraltar on the issue of whether corporation tax changes proposed by the Government of Gibraltar in 2002 breached EU rules on State aid. In this judgment the ECJ has set aside the earlier judgment of the General Court of the European Union (General Court) dated 18 December 2008 and has found that the proposed tax regime, which was abandoned some time ago and was never implemented in Gibraltar, constituted State aid on grounds of material selectivity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background to this case is that in August 2002 the UK notified the Commission, pursuant to Article 88(3) of the then EC Treaty (now Article 108(3) TfEU), that Gibraltar proposed to make changes to its tax system that would involve the introduction of a Payroll Tax and a Business Property Occupation Tax (BPOT). The Commission’s Decision of March 2004 found that the Payroll Tax and BPOT were materially selective because they would inherently favour offshore companies that had no physical presence in Gibraltar and which, as a consequence, would not incur corporation tax. The Commission also found that the proposed changes to Gibraltar’s tax system were regionally selective on the grounds that they provided for a system under which companies in Gibraltar would be taxed, in general, at a lower rate than those in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and the Government of Gibraltar both contested the Commission’s Decision in respect of both material and regional selectivity. On 18 December 2008 the Court of First Instance (now the General Court) annulled the Commission’s Decision. The General Court found that Gibraltar’s tax proposals did not breach EU rules on State aid on grounds of material selectivity. Moreover the General Court ruled that the frame of reference for assessing whether Gibraltar’s proposals were regionally selective corresponded exclusively to Gibraltar’s territorial limits. The General Court therefore upheld, under EU law, Gibraltar’s freedom to set tax rates that are different from those in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission and Spain both brought appeal actions asking the ECJ to set aside the General Court’s judgment. The Commission’s single ground of appeal was on the question of material selectivity. Spain appealed on both regional and material selectivity. The ECJ’s judgment of 15 November 2011 is the final ruling in these proceedings. The ECJ found that Gibraltar’s tax proposals were materially selective in that they granted selective advantages to offshore companies. It held that in view of its finding on material selectivity it was not relevant to examine whether Gibraltar’s proposals were regionally selective.          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECJ’s decision not to examine the issue of regional selectivity means that there has been no change in the principles established by the Court in the Azores case (ECJ case C-88/03 Portugal v Commission). According to those principles autonomous regional bodies within an EU Member State may set lower levels of tax than in the rest of the Member State without giving rise to State aid provided that certain criteria for determining the autonomous status of the regional body are met. In accordance with its constitutional arrangements, Gibraltar is a fiscally autonomous entity with responsibility for the management of its economy, including taxation, vested in the Government of Gibraltar. The UK is committed to upholding the Gibraltar Constitution. The ECJ’s judgment of 15 November 2011 does not change Gibraltar’s constitutional relationship with the UK or Gibraltar’s freedom to set a tax regime that differs from the UK’s.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for the Government of Gibraltar, as the authority responsible for the tax system in Gibraltar, to consider the implications for Gibraltar of the ECJ’s ruling on material selectivity.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 15 November 2011 the then Government of Gibraltar issued a statement which stated that the judgment would have no adverse impact on Gibraltar since the proposed tax scheme that was examined by the ECJ had never been implemented and the proposal had since been abandoned in favour of an income tax of 10% for all companies. The new Government of Gibraltar takes the same view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government will keep the House informed of any further significant developments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Written Ministerial Statement on the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written statement the Minister for Europe David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council were held on 10-11 October in Luxembourg.  My Rt. Hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I represented the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council-fac"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council (FAC)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAC was chaired by Baroness Ashton.  A provisional report of the meeting, and all Conclusions adopted, can be found at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/125028.pdf"&gt;http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/125028.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bosnia-and-herzegovina-bih"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although BiH was not a formal agenda item, Ministers agreed Conclusions which reaffirmed the EU’s support for the continuation of the EU’s military force’s (EUFOR Althea) executive mandate.  The Conclusions also included a reference to ‘looking forward to discussions’ on the future of the Office of the High Representative (OHR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="belarus"&gt;belarus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed to renew the EU’s restrictive measures against belarus, and added sixteen new names to the travel ban and assets freeze list.  There was broad agreement that the EU should not consider renewing a dialogue with the belarusian authorities until all political prisoners have been released and rehabilitated.  Ministers also endorsed ongoing work by Commissioner Stefan Fule on engaging civil society in belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers expressed concern about the trial and upcoming verdict on Yulia Tymoshenko.  There was a discussion about the impact the verdict might have on finalising the EU’s Association Agreement with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after the FAC, Yuliya Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison.  Speaking after the verdict the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The conviction of the Ukrainian opposition politician, Yuliya Tymoshenko, by a court in Kyiv is deeply concerning. Independent legal experts including the Danish Helsinki Committee have concluded that Ms Tymoshenko’s trial was subject to numerous and serious violations of fundamental legal principles, in direct contradiction of common European values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ukraine says it wants to join the EU one day. The UK supports that objective. But that cannot happen until Ukraine can show that it adheres to the highest democratic standards, including respect for human rights, the rule of law and an independent, transparent and fair judicial process.  The conviction of Ms Tymoshenko and the ongoing cases against other former members of the government call into question Ukraine’s commitment to these values. This could pose a major obstacle to the signature and ratification of the Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-china-summit"&gt;EU-China Summit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers reviewed preparations for the fourteenth EU-China Summit, which takes place in China on 25 October.  The Foreign Secretary stressed the need for the EU to focus on increased market access for EU businesses.  He also urged the EU to continue to raise human rights issues at the highest level, and underlined the importance of global cooperation on cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Ashton set out the results of the Tunisian Task Force meeting of 28-29 September.  She had co-chaired the meeting with the Prime Minister of Tunisia, which had also been attended by Member States, European institutions, the European Investment Bank, the EBRD, the World Bank, the Africa Bank and representatives from the private sector.  Around €4 billion was pledged to Tunisia over the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Egypt, concern was expressed by many Ministers about the recent outbreaks of violence.  There was broad agreement on the importance of protecting freedom of religion and belief.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed Conclusions on Libya which:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaffirmed the EU’s support for the National Transition Council.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Welcomed the continuation of the operation to enforce UNSCR 1973 and ensure the protection of the Libyan population.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Welcomed the adoption of UNSCR 2009 and the return of Libya to the UN as represented by the National Transitional Council.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stressed the need for all in Libya to respect all international obligations and the rule of law.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expressed concern about the dissemination of conventional weapons in Libya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set out the EU’s willingness to work under UN coordination to consider Libyan needs in the fields of democratisation, rule of law, institution-building, security sector reform and police training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed Conclusions on Syria which condemned the ongoing brutal repression by the Syrian regime. Ministers expressed disappointment with the failure of the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution against Syria. They reiterated their determination to continue with targeted sanctions against the Syrian regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Yemen, Ministers agreed Conclusions which stressed concern about the situation in the country.  They called for President Saleh to sign and implement the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative.  And they welcomed the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and urged the authorities in Yemen to act on its recommendations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Foreign Secretary and others stressed the need to hold out the possibility of meaningful market access to the neighbourhood, in exchange for real political and democratic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers agreed Conclusions which reiterated their support for Baroness Ashton’s efforts on behalf of the EU to re-launch the Peace Process.  There was an appeal for both parties to resume negotiations under the terms set out in the Quartet Statement of 23 September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers expressed their disappointment with the recent settlement expansion in the East Jerusalem settlement of Gilo.  Baroness Ashton briefed Ministers on the Quartet Envoys’ meeting of 9 October in Brussels and plans to invite the parties to meet in the coming days. The Foreign Secretary emphasised the need for continued EU unity in response to any resolutions proposed at the United Nations in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on Iran focused on two areas:  the EU’s growing concern over human rights, and Iran’s nuclear programme.  On human rights, Ministers agreed to add twenty-nine names to its sanctions list, in addition to the thirty-two officials previously agreed in April.  On the nuclear issue, Baroness Ashton briefed Ministers on E3+3 talks in New York in the margin of the UN General Assembly and her meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister.  She also outlined plans for taking forward talks with Iran.  The Foreign Secretary made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome the EU’s agreement today to impose restrictive measures on a further twenty-nine Iranians responsible for grave human rights abuses. Those targeted include Government Ministers, members of the security forces, prison staff and judiciary responsible for serious human rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In recent months the human rights situation in Iran has continued to deteriorate. As we mark World Day against the Death Penalty we should recall that Iran has now executed over 500 people this year, including a 17 year old boy. The government has violently suppressed protests over the mismanagement of a lake in north-west Iran, and families of a number of journalists have been arrested and harassed. We will continue to identify and list those who seriously violate the human rights of the Iranian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s decision sends a clear message to every individual on this list, and others in the Iranian regime, that we will not stand by. They will be held to account for their actions and should not involve themselves in the appalling abuses we continue to witness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-external-representation"&gt;EU External Representation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers had a brief informal exchange on EU external representation in international organisations.  The Foreign Secretary said we supported effective external action by the EU, in accordance with the Treaties.  But we needed to ensure that this did not affect the balance of competences between the EU and Member States; and that Member States remained free to act where they had the right to do so.  He agreed that the EAS should propose effective arrangements in line with these principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council-gac"&gt;General Affairs Council (GAC)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GAC was chaired by the Polish EU Presidency (Mikolaj Dowgielewicz, State Secretary for European Affairs).  A draft record of the meeting can be found at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/genaff/125036.pdf"&gt;http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/genaff/125036.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cohesion-policy"&gt;Cohesion Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers heard a presentation by Commissioner Hahn (Regional Policy) of proposals for rules on implementing the EU’s policy on economic and social cohesion in 2012-20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="growth-enhancing-measures"&gt;Growth-Enhancing Measures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Presidency presented its report “Towards a European consensus on growth” (see link below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://pl2011.eu/sites/default/files/users/shared/spotkania_i_wydarzenia/presidency_report_on_growth.pdf"&gt;http://pl2011.eu/sites/default/files/users/shared/spotkania_i_wydarzenia/presidency_report_on_growth.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report identifies potential growth-enhancing measures which might help the EU overcome the current economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="g20-summit-in-cannes"&gt;G20 Summit in Cannes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers discussed with Commissioner Sefcovic (Inter-Institutional Relations and Administration) preparations for the G-20 Summit in Cannes on 3-4 November.  The Commissioner  set out proposed EU priorities: the Eurozone and the global economic recovery; the resilience of the international monetary system; tackling commodity prices; providing a way forward for Doha and the WTO; development; food security; a strong message on Climate Change and Durban; and the proposed Financial Transaction Tax (FTT).  I stressed that the UK was firmly against promoting a FTT at the G20 Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-of-the-october-european-council"&gt;Preparation of the October European Council&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the GAC, the President of the Council, Van Rompuy, joined Ministers by video link to discuss preparations for the Council.  He explained that the Council had been pushed back to Sunday 23 October to allow Heads of State and Government to consider issues relating to Greece, the European banks and the Eurozone governance more comprehensively as a package.  I argued that any future institutional changes to governance in the Eurozone had to protect fully the interests of all 27 Member States, and there had to be clear language to that effect in the European Council Conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also stressed the need for the Council Conclusions to address some significant foreign policy developments, particularly Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will deposit copies of this note in the libraries of both Houses. And I will also continue to update Parliament on future Foreign and General Affairs Councils.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What the EU needs to do to remain competitive</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Europe David Lidington today attended the launch of Business for New Europe’s new publication, &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bnegroup.org/images/uploads/publications/files/BNE_Competitiveness_Publication_singles.pdf"&gt;Competitiveness: What the EU needs to do&lt;/a&gt; at Aviva plc. The publication includes essays from business leaders and identifies priorities for securing economic growth in the EU: completing the single market, supporting innovation, reducing the burdens of regulation and opening Europe for trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributors to the report include Sir Roger Carr, Chairman of Centrica, Roland Rudd, Chairman of BNE, Andrew Moss, CEO of Aviva, Vittorio Colao, CEO of Vodafone, Dr Chris Gibson-Smith, Chairman of the London Stock Exchange, and other leading business figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his foreword to the report, Minister for Europe David Lidington calls for governments and businesses across Europe to work together to drive greater innovation and enterprise across the EU:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have the ideas, industry and drive to return Europe to strong economic growth. Combining these assets with an open and liberal outlook provides the surest way for Europe to prosper…We know what needs to be done. The challenge now is to make it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the launch of the report David Lidington said, “I am delighted to welcome this publication from Business for New Europe. It shows that the UK’s business leaders are thinking about what is needed for a strong and competitive European Union economy. I firmly believe that together we can ensure future economic success for all Europe’s citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report by Business for New Europe follows the Prime Minister’s recent pamphlet &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/EU_growth.pdf"&gt;Let’s Choose Growth&lt;/a&gt; which makes the case for completing the Single Market to boost growth, and sets out the risks to Europe if it allows itself to fall behind other leading economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>European Council unites over Libya, Japan and economic growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the two-day summit, Mr Cameron also said he had made good progress in translating Britain’s budget for growth into a “new agenda for the European economy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European economic growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the recommendations in a joint letter from the Prime Minister and eight other EU leaders, the PM said that the European Council had agreed “that ‘the single market has a key role to play in delivering growth’, and that we should bring new impetus to our efforts to complete it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit also agreed that the overall regulatory burden should be reduced, and concluded that the Doha round and other powerful free trade agreements should be continued in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, there is more that needs to be done, but I do believe this is a strong start. I was particularly heartened on the language there will be on micro-enterprises and exempting micro-enterprises from future regulations for their first five years of existence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Libya, the Prime Minister said that the situation has “come a long way in a short time”. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The action we have taken in the space of a few short days has saved countless civilian lives and has successfully established a no-fly zone. In the last 24 hours, the momentum has continued to build. NATO has taken on the command to control of the no-fly zone, in addition to the arms embargo that it was already enforcing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that “it is clear that European countries are now fully on board with this mission” and had “agreed to find ways to support the Libyan people’s aspirations for more democratic and open government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Tuesday Britain will be hosting a broad international conference in London to review progress and to plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Cameron paid tribute to all of those involved in enforcing the no-fly-zone for their “incredible skill and their courage”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Japan, Europe has made the same pledge as the Prime Minister made to the Japanese Prime Minister yesterday; to “do all we can to speed Japan’s recovery from the earthquake and the tsunami of two weeks ago”. The Prime Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe one of our priorities in order to demonstrate good faith must be to invite Japan to enter into a free-trade area with the EU, which would help boost their economy and help their businesses to recover. I secured a specific reference to that in the conclusions [of the summit] that will be published later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>EU enlargement - a UK perspective</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Schussel, Dr Tiroch, Governor Nowotny, Ambassador Christiani, your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to say is that it is a great pleasure to have this opportunity to speak here on my first visit to Vienna as the British Minister for Europe.  And it is a rare pleasure to be the guest of three different institutions all at the same time.  So I’m glad to be part of what I still think of as the re-launch phase of the Austro-British Society - and my thanks go to Dr Tiroch, and to Ambassador Christiani, and all the Presidium of the Society who have worked so enthusiastically to bring the Austro-British Society back to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m honoured too to be a guest in these elegant surroundings at the heart of the Austrian National Bank. I understand that this building was originally intended as a place in which to print money, but it assumed its function as the Bank’s headquarters just at the point where, with the introduction of the Schilling, the key task was to break with the era of money printing and the crippling inflation that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least I am grateful, Chancellor Schussel, to you, and to the Austrian Foreign Policy and UN Association for co-hosting this event - and I salute your association’s role as a focal point for discussion and ideas about the broad European and global issues for which Vienna - with its place at the centre of Europe and as the location for so many international organisations- acts as an effective forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course there is nothing new about Vienna as a meeting point for international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a keen historian as well as politician and no historian can come to this city and be indifferent to buildings that still resonate with the echoes of the Vienna Congress whose 200th anniversary is now just a few years away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I had a great treat this afternoon because the Ambassador generously squeezed 30 minutes out of my official diary after lunch and we went to the Staatsarchiv to see the original documents of the Congress of Vienna with the seals of all the leaders in place, Metternich at the head.  And of course the long list of European leaders who swept into town for that Congress is as familiar to many of you here in the audience as is, I suspect, the caustic summary of their roles quoted in Egon Friedell’s “Kulturgeschichte der Neuzeit”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Der Kaiser von Russland liebt fur alle; der Konig von Preußen denkt fur alle; der Konig von Danemark spricht fur alle; der Konig von Bayern trinkt fur alle; der Konig von Wurttemberg frisst fur alle …. Und der Kaiser von Österreich zahlt fur alle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Tsar of Russia falls in love for everyone; the King of Prussia thinks for everyone, the King of Denmark speaks for everyone; the King of Bavaria drinks for everyone; the King of Wurttemberg eats for everyone … and the Emperor of Austria pays for everyone”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will leave it to the Austrian members of this audience to reflect on the value-for-money.  But I’d observe that there’s no role attributed at all to the British presence.  This may have been because the British monarch wasn’t there in person, but was represented by his Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh.  A portrait of whom I have hanging behind my desk at the Foreign Office now. Or perhaps it was because the British delegation was attracting attention in - how shall I put it - other ways.  A contemporary British historian, Adam Zamoyski, in a recent study of the Congress, quotes a contemporary diarist’s view that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is complaining about the lack of breeding of the English and their ladies.  There is no kind of rudeness and gaucherie which they do not commit.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he continues with the disturbing comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The image of the British delegation was not improved by the behaviour of the British Ambassador.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that, in that respect too, times have now changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating though it is to recall the Congress and the way it reshaped the map of Europe, my focus tonight is on the future, not the past.  And it’s on our current shared efforts to set out and implement a vision for a Europe of strength and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a future from which, once again, Vienna looks out on the world from a central position; from the perspective of a city for more than 40 years of the post war age confined at the eastern end of Western Europe.  But a city now, once again, at the centre of a united Europe, in a country at the heart of a region where the old barriers have come down and new opportunities have multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will argue tonight that today’s Europe - notwithstanding the serious economic challenges we face - is above all a region of opportunity.  Above all, of opportunity for countries like Austria and Britain, whose economies rely heavily on export success and on an ambitious approach to investing in emerging markets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both our countries, the opportunity lies not in a European Union that is standing still, but from being part of a dynamic European Union that is on the move and which is active in exercising its transformational power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s that dynamic, outward-looking aspect of the European Union that I want to talk about tonight. In particular, I want to set out Britain’s strong commitment to an ambitious agenda for enlargement, and not least to rebut two false propositions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first, that the EU should set more modest enlargement aims. The phrase “pause after Croatia” is one too frequently heard -  that it should rather just concentrate on putting its own house in order; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the charge that the UK supports enlargement only because it wants to overburden the EU and make it less successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it will be no shock to you to hear me say that I believe that the EU has its faults, and my country, my Government is determined to work within the EU to improve those shortcomings. But those deficiencies need to be set in the balance against the truly historic achievement of establishing a model for a community of nations governing relations among themselves according to the rule of law. That is a model of political development that has enabled the EU through its policy of enlargement to entrench democracy, the rule of law and human rights in parts of our continent where those traditions were crushed for most of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British support for enlargement goes back a long way. Margaret Thatcher is not normally thought of as an enthusiastic European. But in her famous Bruges speech she declared at a time when it was is not fashionable, nor even believable, that it was important for all to remember that Prague, and Warsaw and Budapest were also great European cities. And I was delighted when I went to the opening of the new headquarters of the Commission and the European Parliament in London recently, to be told that they included Mrs. Thatcher’s speech in their selection of great speeches on the subject of Europe made by British political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as Chancellor Schussel said, I was working in the Foreign Office at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, as Political Adviser to our then Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd. I remember watching the news bulletins and I remember each day receiving the telegrams from our Ambassadors reporting the changes that were sweeping across Central and Eastern Europe. And I remember the pivotal role played by Austria. The reports of Foreign Minister Alois Mock symbolically cutting through the border fence with his Hungarian counterpart  - an act that then paved the way for that Pan European picnic, came to be a significant milestone on the path to the reunification of Germany. And what I recall from that time was a real sense of the continent of Europe at last coming together again after the fracture of 1914, a division that had been made far worse and more deeply entrenched by the events of World War II and then the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not exaggerating if I say that this was probably the single most exciting and welcome set of international events in my lifetime. During this time of great change, the artificial political barriers between East and West in Europe were swept away. The peoples of East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Baltic States and others shared the values and the aspirations of their Western neighbours and they demanded the same democratic and political freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I compare the history of Central and Eastern Europe since 1989 with that of the continent in the 1920’s and 30’s what is striking is that this time around freedom, democracy and the rule of law have been sustained and strengthened instead of being a passing illusion. The key to this was the magnet of attraction that is the EU, proving how effective and dynamic EU enlargement can be. Yes, there were experiments with democracy in Central and Eastern Europe after the First World War but for reasons that you will understand better than I, they did not take root and work. But it was different after 1989, because it was in the context of a European Union where vital support and encouragement was offered to those countries as aspirant member states. That is why we in Britain were and are so enthusiastic about enlargement, because it is a momentum that builds stability, security and prosperity across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it would be a profound mistake to let this momentum stall. We are a continent steeped in history, but we must not become mired in it. In a changing world, whose economic and political weight is swinging eastwards, the European Union will remain strong only if it is outward-looking and continues to grow. That is why we in Britain are strong supporters of the EU neighbourhood policy and believe that membership of the EU should be open for any European country that wants to join, and can meet the rigorous accession criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today both Croatia and Iceland are well on track to meet those criteria and I know that both the UK and Austria look forward to welcoming them as member states in the near future. But tonight I want to consider the case for some prospective member states, whose accession is a little further down the line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I speak of the fracture of Europe in 1914, it was of course in the Balkans that the first crack appeared with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Both Austria and the UK share the strong conviction that an active and activist EU has an essential role to play in the Western Balkans: promoting modern, reformed states and institutions, and entrenching stability there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are unequivocal in our support for all the countries of the region achieving future membership of the European Union.  This is the vital strategic goal: shared security and prosperity built on a firm foundation of democracy and the rule of law. We want to see the Western Balkans back in Europe, extending stability and success to a part of the world where conflict is still an all too recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this I believe that the governments of the Western Balkans need to display real political leadership and demonstrate that concrete steps are being taken to fulfil the membership criteria.  We are very clear that the region must meet these criteria. We will not countenance the criteria being adapted to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need to match their commitment by providing support, encouragement and technical assistance to the Western Balkans.  We have underlined that the European Union and the wider international community should sharpen its focus on the region, and pursue an active approach that will deliver results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do things stand? As you know the countries of the Western Balkans have made good progress, though problems remain. The European Union has a critical role to play in supporting the search for resolutions to these problems. It is fundamentally in our interest to have secure, prosperous neighbours and to help remove obstacles to these countries’ accession. We can help resolve disagreements between countries and promote necessary reforms within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where we are urging political leaders to form new coalition governments quickly and with the EU reform agenda at the heart of their programmes. The UK believes that the EU will then need to take a proactive and further role in driving forward reform progress. And we see an equally important ongoing role for the EU and the wider international community in preserving stability and in upholding the Dayton agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or look at Serbia and Kosovo. We strongly support the dialogue facilitated by the EU between Belgrade and Pristina that is now beginning, and the opportunity which it offers to build a positive relationship that moves both countries, and I stress both countries, along their paths to EU membership. Last year’s work on a United Nations General Assembly resolution and the agreement to establish a dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo demonstrates how the EU can exert a stabilising and forward-looking influence in region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third telling example is the internal situation in Albania where a co-ordinated European and international approach is crucial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambassador Lajcak has been instrumental in recent days in trying to calm a dangerous political crisis. We now need to urge Albania’s political leaders to resolve peacefully the long-standing political stalemate in that country and put Albania back on track to accession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that both Austria and Britain will continue to work within the EU to help all the countries of the Western Balkans to realise their potential as prospective member states. Indeed, the Western Balkans provides the key test of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I’d like to make the case for another country of immense potential and test slightly more controversial waters by moving to discussion of Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Turkey is a hugely important partner for the European Union. It is a market full of opportunity for European business and a pivotal country in its reach and influence into the Middle East and the Islamic world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is hard to challenge any of those propositions.  But clearly current EU member states find it harder to coalesce around a view that these facts add up to an argument for Turkey joining the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We in Britain will continue to argue that they do: that membership for Turkey would enhance Europe’s economy, strengthen Europe’s influence and offer Europe the opportunity to extend and entrench democracy, human rights and the rule of law through modernising and reforming Turkey’s political and economic structures in harmony with European institutions and European values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take these factors briefly in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economics are plain: Turkey is already Europe’s 6th and the world’s 16th largest economy. The OECD estimates that Turkey will be the third fastest growing country after just China and India by 2017. Turkish membership would play a major part in Europe’s long term prosperity. The European Union already has a Customs Union with Turkey and accession would resolve many of the current problems businesses are experiencing with that Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Turkish membership would make the EU a weightier actor on the global stage, increasing its influence in international relations. Turkey’s regional influence is considerable, for instance in the Balkans it has far greater leverage than many individual EU countries, and its position at the intersection of three areas of strategic importance, the Middle East, the Balkans and the Caucasus, would contribute significantly to the European Union’s growing security capabilities. Turkish membership could also make a real difference to tackling security and terrorism issues, helping to combat the radicalisation of Muslim communities within Europe and to reach out to the Islamic world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today in North Africa and in the Middle East we hear the demand of a new generation for political reform, for the right to have their say in shaping the destinies of the countries in which they live. At such a time I would far rather the Islamic world, and particularly the young people of the Arab and the wider Muslim world, looked to Prime Minister Erdogan as their model political leader rather than to a Mr Ahmedinejad, and a Turkish voice in EU decision-making would give us far greater credibility in our dealings with our North African and Middle Eastern neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And third, the path to European Union accession has prompted the most dramatic democratic reform process in Turkey in decades, with improvements in freedom of expression, human rights and rule of law. Turkey is on the move, its population is young, dynamic and forward-thinking - Turkey is now the world’s 4th largest Facebook network- we need to help it to continue in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that these benefits can be fully captured if we are not prepared to focus on Turkish accession as something that - in time - really can and should happen. The British government believes that the European Union must work hard to keep Turkey’s accession on track. Of course, like all prospective members, Turkey must meet the accession criteria and take the difficult decisions to implement the reforms necessary to join, for example, by making the changes needed to meet the tough benchmark requirements to open Chapter 8 on competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important obstacle on Turkey’s path to accession is of course the division of Cyprus. Divisions on the island are deeply entrenched. But it is important that we help the leaders of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots to show statesmanship and courage in the months ahead. The status quo in Cyprus is a profoundly unattractive option - everyone loses. In contrast, the rewards of a settlement would be enormous - political, economic and security benefits not only to all Cypriots, of both communities, but to Turkey itself, to the rest of the Europe, and to the entire eastern Mediterranean region. The UK is strongly committed to achieving a settlement and we will continue to support the UN and work closely with the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve focused so far on a range of countries with which an accession negotiation is either under way or is at least in prospect in the near to medium term. But the European vision should not stop there. We should commit ourselves I believe, with renewed energy, to a European perspective for the countries of the Eastern Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should seize this opportunity to apply its transformational power over a still wider area, giving incentives for change, encouraging transparent and accountable practices in both business and government.  There is a lot at stake: we’ve seen what has happened in Belarus over the last two months; and I have seen for myself that in Ukraine in the last ten years there has been progress, but it is progress that we cannot take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eastern Partnership can deliver these changes, and that is why the UK strongly supports it.  But I believe that Europe needs to change its rhetoric: if the Eastern Partnership is to achieve its potential, it needs to generate enthusiasm for participation amongst its partners.  Too many of them see it as an alternative to membership, and that is because we’re spending too much time telling each other that it is not an accession instrument.  It isn’t; that’s true. But nor is it, or should it be, a dead end for our partners in the East of Europe.  It can help them further along the path to an eventual membership application, if that is what they want.  We need to be open and welcoming about this.  Engage in our ambitious Eastern Partnership, embrace reform, commit yourselves to the acquis, and in due course you will be in a better position to apply for full membership and will be encouraged to do so. No-one should be under any illusion, this is not going to happen overnight, but we owe it to our partners and to ourselves to leave that door open. And when you talk to political leaders, most obviously at the moment in Moldova, you see that the appeal of the EU, the magnets that I referred to earlier, of EU membership, is what continues more than any other factor to drive forward support for both political and for economic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the British vision of a dynamic, outward-looking Europe. I hope it is clear to you that we see this as a profoundly positive agenda; not a negative one. It is focussed on a shared strategic objective: a continent of Europe reunited, prosperous and confident on the world stage. So let me finish by returning to those two false propositions. To those who argue that we should be taking a more modest approach to enlargement, I counter that a bold enlargement programme plays to Europe’s strengths. The entrenchment of stability and democracy, the Single Market, the free movement of workers, the collective approach towards developing a low carbon economy - these great successes of the European Union are founded upon the principle that together the countries of Europe are greater than the sum of our parts. I believe that principle still stands. Of course the workings of the European Union can be improved, and we are determined to be actively engaged in doing so, but halting the momentum of enlargement is absolutely not the solution to Europe’s internal problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when pessimists and cynics suggest further enlargement would overburden the European Union, would grind it to a bureaucratic halt, I am reminded of a memorable line of the great Austrian writer and intellectual Robert Musil, who satirized the naysayers of artistic innovation with the words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man mochte sich gern uber den Fortschritt freuen, wenn er bloß ein Ende hatte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not be short-sighted in seeking to place limits on the potential of the European Union. We have seen since 2004 that enlargement has extended the Single Market by an additional 104 million consumers. This has created greater trade and investment opportunities within Europe and made us more competitive in the global market. We need to continue along this path if we are to build and maintain a stable, prosperous European space.  Far from diluting or degrading the European Union, successful enlargement and neighbourhood policies are a testament to its enduring coherence and strength.  In Britain it is our recognition of the great benefits of belonging to the European Union that motivates us to champion extending those benefits to all countries in our continent who meet the accession criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many years from now we’ll be looking back on the role Vienna played 200 years ago in setting out a vision for a new Europe.  Two centuries on, I look forward to Britain and Austria working together again to realise our shared outward-looking ambition for a modern and successful Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Chancellor urges EU to make the most of the Single Market</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chancellor George Osborne highlighted the potential of the Single Market to boost jobs and growth across Europe at a regular meeting of European Finance Ministers in Brussels on 18 January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of ideas from the European Commission intended to re-invigorate the Single Market, known as the Single Market Act, were discussed at the meeting. A fully-working Single Market has the potential to create an additional 350,000 jobs in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The EU must tackle head-on the issues holding back confidence and growth. Because jobs and incomes are what count for families everywhere in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s why today’s discussion of proposals that could support an additional 2.75 million jobs across Europe over the next decade is so important. The test for our Single Market is whether we can make it easier for firms and shoppers to buy and sell across borders and quicker for entrepreneurs to start their own business at home and across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK wants to see the full implementation of the EU Services Directive, which makes it easier for service businesses (e.g. accountants, builders, vets, travel agents, hairdressers) to set up or sell their services anywhere in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Services Directive across the EU could deliver around 600,000 new jobs in the UK and it is estimated to be worth about £4-6 billion per annum to the UK economy with the UK forecast to be the second largest beneficiary in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to improve the business environment for enterprises by removing barriers to cross-border trade and creating a framework that gives UK businesses and consumers more confidence in selling and buying goods online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is also keen to enhance the stability of European economies through greater transparency in financial markets, and independent supervision of the financial sector, which will restore market confidence and benefit UK businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>European Council concludes in Brussels</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Council endorsed a report on the Task Force on economic governance, discussed preparation for the G20 Seoul Summit and the Cancun Conference on climate change as well as the summits with the US, Russia and Ukraine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/117496.pdf"&gt;Read the full Council conclusions&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the council, Prime Minister David Cameron published a joint statement at the European Council, signed by 11 countries, on the proposed increase of around 6% to the 2011 EU budget.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These proposals are especially unacceptable at a time when we are having to take difficult decisions at national level to control public expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council has proposed an increase in EU budget spending of 2.91% for 2011.  We are clear that we cannot accept any more than this.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Secretary William Hague discussed the statement on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the Prime Minister has now secured among the heads of government is more than enough allies to make sure that the proposals of the Commission of Parliament are rejected and that the rise is limited to 2.9%.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that for us is the beginning, as you can tell from what I’m saying, of… now a much longer road over the next 18 months to get some real sense into how the European budget is set for the longer term.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=PressS&amp;amp;id=23113342"&gt;Read the full Joint Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Joint Statement on the 2011 EU budget</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to the President of the European Council, the leaders said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At the European Council on 28 and 29 October, we are discussing how the European Union can strengthen the mechanisms we have for ensuring Member States’ fiscal discipline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that the Union takes the necessary steps to ensure that we have robust systems that allow us to support the substantial deficit and debt reduction strategies now in place in Member States under the Stability and Growth Pact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion will take place against the backdrop of proposals from the Commission and the European Parliament for an increase in EU budget spending of around 6% in 2011.  These proposals are especially unacceptable at a time when we are having to take difficult decisions at national level to control public expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council has proposed an increase in EU budget spending of 2.91% for 2011.  We are clear that we cannot accept any more than this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The Single Market is “essential to this government’s agenda for trade and competitiveness”</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will need further rapid action across Europe to adjust our 20th century social economic models to the 21st century challenges of ageing societies, the transition to low carbon and the growing commercial, technological and political power of the emerging economies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Europe said that “the UK will be at the forefront of the growth agenda in the EU because the Single Market is essential to this government’s agenda for trade and competitiveness”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 3.5 million jobs in the UK (10% of the workforce) are linked directly or indirectly to the export of goods and services to other EU countries. And Europe accounts for approximately half of the UK’s imports and exports. The Minister described the Single Market as “an incredibly valuable asset to this country”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing the scale of the challenge ahead, the Minister for Europe said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Although Europe has returned to growth, with the Commission forecasting growth of 1.8% in 2010, there are significant divergences between Member States. While Germany and Poland are forecast to grow by 3.4% the economies of Spain, Ireland, Greece and Cyprus are expected to continue to contract in 2010”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“More fundamentally, the European Commission estimates that the potential growth rate of the euro-area, Denmark, Sweden and the UK will be cut in half in 2009-2010 compared with 2008, from a growth rate range of 1.3%-1.6% to 0.7%-0.8%”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the EU economy will have lost over €2 trillion of potential income between 2007 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister for Europe identified three “clear levers” which would “quickly and significantly advance our prosperity”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Single Market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better regulation of that market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Commission’s competence on trade  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some specific new areas into which the single market should be expanded and modernised, including the digital and green economies and in the services sector where further liberation is necessary”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the area of good and services (especially business-to-business services), many of the remaining barriers result from inconsistent implementation and enforcement of existing European legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Member States need to step up efforts to record and tackle trade barriers reported by business, especially small to medium enterprises and the European Commission should increase its challenge of poor enforcement by Member States”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The UK: "an enthusiastic champion of enlargement of the EU"</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir, The Times is to be congratulated for highlighting so vividly the state of the EU’s eastern neighbourhood. Earlier this week I was in Moldova with my German counterpart, Werner Hoyer. We saw how the desire for EU membership continues to drive political and economic reforms. Moldova shows how a government committed to a closer relationship with the EU can make real progress in tackling structural economic and political problems. We and other EU countries are working hard with the Moldovan government to help it to introduce reforms that will bring it nearer the EU. We’re providing practical support for its efforts to tackle problems such as corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has been an enthusiastic champion of enlargement of the EU. The prospect of enlargement continues to help to embed freedom, security and prosperity across the Continent. The challenge now is to provide the same vision and support for Ukraine, Moldova and the other countries of Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kostyantyn Gryshchenko visited the Foreign Office to meet the Foreign Secretary.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their meeting, they discussed the development of democracy in Ukraine, Ukraine’s ambitious political and economic reform agenda and opportunities for increased trade and investment, in particular through early completion of negotiations on a deep and comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary welcomed the Ukrainian Government’s aspirations for membership of the European Union and assured the Ukrainian Foreign Minister of the UK’s support for the reforms that will be necessary to achieve this.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Response to public comments on the Coalition Government’s approach to Europe</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that so many of you feel jaded and sceptical about the EU. Speaking about the EU in Parliament, the Foreign Secretary said he knows there is “a profound disconnection between the British people and what has been done in their name by British Governments”. We want to deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we have said we will not agree to any further transfer of sovereignty or powers from the UK to the EU during this Parliament. We are committed to ensuring that the British people have their say on any future proposed transfers of powers to the EU. So we are introducing a law to ensure that any future EU Treaty that transfers competences or areas of power from the UK to the EU will be subject to a referendum. This ‘referendum lock’ will ensure no Government will be able to pass more powers to the EU without your consent. This is part of our commitment to be more accountable to you for what we do in the EU.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU does need to change and do better. As is widely recognised across Europe, European countries through the EU really need to focus on how we can get our economies growing strongly. The Single Market could work better and cross-border regulation needs to be be simpler and smarter. We can help achieve this - and move Europe in the right direction. The government is clear that, at a time when so many countries across Europe are tightening their belts, the EU must do the same. At the same time, we are pushing for a larger EU. This would not just promote UK values of stability, security and prosperity to millions of people, but would also benefit UK interests. We stand to gain from the economic growth, energy security and low carbon growth in a larger EU. We are fighting for the UK’s interests in the EU and will play an active and activist role in making the EU a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU does offer real benefits and opportunities for people and businesses  and we want to ensure that the UK is able to make the most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of our EU membership British firms can sell their products and services in the 27 countries which make up the Single Market. That’s 500 million potential customers.  And this means our firms don’t have to deal with 26 separate lots of rules and regulations. They don’t have to get their products approved separately in 27 different countries. There are no customs documents, saving hours of form filling and delays at ports. This all saves money for the 300,000 UK firms which do business in the single market. Investors from other EU countries also put money into the UK, which helps create jobs. In 2007, over half the investment in the UK economy came from EU  countries . Keeping costs down and increasing investment  are vital for the economic growth  if we want to get Britain working again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Single Market also helps British consumers. EU action has  led to  lower mobile roaming prices across EU borders. It’s also improved consumer rights  on the sale of goods. British citizens now have protection against faulty or substandard products bought locally, in another country or even from, say, Amazon in France .  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing things through the EU helps in other ways  too: from the laws that protect our birds as they migrate between the British Isles and Africa,  to working with other EU countries to get our collective voice heard in world affairs. With so many world issues affecting us, working in partnership with group of nationals in the EU enables us to take more effective action for Britain’s security and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, while the EU - that’s the EU institutions in Brussels and the governments of the countries that make up the EU - does some things well, there are many things it could do better - and some of what it does can be justly criticised. And it’s certainly true that the Government needs to become more democratically accountable for what happens in the EU. The Coalition Government wants to listen to what you have to say on this issue and, where there’s room for improvement, act on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Prime Minister meets European Leaders</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron travelled yesterday to France for talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy. The Prime Minister met President Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Thursday evening where he was greeted with a guard of honour.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his “fruitful and focused” meeting with the President they discussed issues ranging from Iran and Afghanistan to the European Union and Anglo-French relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a joint press conference following their talks, the PM said the two countries could have a “partnership that has a real purpose”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From all the things we have discussed tonight, I think we can have a partnership that has a real purpose, that is very focused, that is very practical, that actually leads to results in the things that we both care about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing the eurozone and the economy, the Prime Minister said the UK would “work well” with France and other nations playing its own part by sticking to a stability pact agreed by the previous administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister also said the UK and France had a “shared agenda” with the forthcoming G8 and G20 meetings and looked forward to the President and his wife visiting London on 18 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister today travelled on to Berlin today where he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks including on Europe’s economy, climate change and Afghanistan.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a press conference following the meeting the Prime Minister said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want us to work together to achieve the economic stability, the growth and action on European deficits that we know is very much in the interest of all our countries and in the interests of a strong, stable economy which we very clearly need.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Britain is not a member of the euro, nor are we likely to become a member, but we want a strong and stable eurozone. That is where 50% of our trade goes and it’s our interest that that takes place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
