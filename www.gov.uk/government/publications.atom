    <title>Housing stock summary</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English housing survey tables supplement information provided in the reports. Tables may also contain data from the former survey of English housing and the English house condition survey, providing information on change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances cells in the tables are based on a small number of cases and should be approached with caution. It may be necessary to add cells across categories before certain data can be used in a meaningful way. Full details of the way in which the survey was conducted, including details of the sample structure, and survey error and its calculation for specific sub-groups, are provided in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-housing-survey-technical-advice"&gt;English housing survey: technical advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tables, where indicated, are based on data from other surveys such as the Office for National Statistics labour force survey. Users should note that there may be slight differences in the household estimates produced using different data sources and methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building regulations Part P: electrical safety in dwellings</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This final impact assessment sets out the proposed changes to Part P of the building regulations and provides an analysis of the associated costs and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals aim to reduce the bureaucracy and cost burdens that Part P imposes on installers, building control bodies and consumers, without undermining the improvements to electrical safety, installer competence and the quality of electrical installation work arising from the introduction of Part P in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This impact assessment updates the consultation impact assessment which was a supporting document for Section 3 of the 2012 &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-electrical-safety"&gt;Building Regulations consultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strategy for UK Life Sciences â€“ One Year On</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update on progress implementing measures in the â€˜Strategy for UK life sciencesâ€™ (URN 11/1429). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy set out a long-term programme with a range of practical measures that the government will take to improve the environment for large and small health life science companies in the UK. It included providing support from discovery right through to the commercialisation of medicines, diagnostics and devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one year on report describes substantial progress made this year in implementing these measures. It also announces the governmentâ€™s intention to commit to sequencing 100,000 whole genomes over the next 3-5 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of continuing government efforts to develop the UKâ€™s position as a global life sciences hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings. The requirements of the Directive were implemented on a phased basis by the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key requirements were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy performance certificate to be produced on the sale, rent or construction of a building&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;display energy certificate to be produced and displayed in large public buildings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;air conditioning equipment above a certain size to be inspected regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes have been made to the regulations, to transpose the requirements of a recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in England and Wales. The main requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013 and are summarised below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property advertisements to include details of energy performance certificate rating where available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no longer a requirement to attach front page of the energy performance certificate to written material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extension of current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500mÂ².  Unlike buildings larger than 1,000mÂ²,  display energy certificates for smaller public buildings will be valid for 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;energy performance certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500mÂ² where one has been previously issued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance documents have been revised to reflect the changes and can be viewed via the links above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new regulations consolidate all existing regulations which have been revoked. They are available at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/" title="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;legislation.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This final impact assessment sets out the proposed changes to the provisions of requirement B2 of the building regulations relating to internal fire spread (linings).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Civil Aviation Act: frequently asked questions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document features frequently asked questions about the Civil Aviation Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Act paves the way for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to motivate airports to deliver better facilities, provide more information for passengers and give greater incentives for airports to prepare for disruptive events such as severe weather. The Act also makes provisions for future reforms to the Air Travel Organisersâ€™ Licensing (ATOL) scheme, which offers financial protection for holiday makers in the event of their tour operator going bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK National Strategy on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2010 the United Kingdom launched a national strategy on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict (PoC). The strategy, a collaboration between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, sets out what the Government is doing to keep the Protection of Civilians at the forefront of our work on political, security and humanitarian fronts. The strategy covers the period 2010-2013, and provides for annual progress reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2012 report summarises the UKâ€™s work in four policy areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protection by peace support operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humanitarian action&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;State capacity&lt;/li&gt;
