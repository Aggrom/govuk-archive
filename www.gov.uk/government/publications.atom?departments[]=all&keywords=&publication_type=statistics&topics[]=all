    <title>Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) statistics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="about-these-statistics"&gt;About these statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These operational statistics about Driver Certificate of Professional (&lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt;) modules and training have not been designated as an official statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics come from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;), and are compiled and published by staff in &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="information-you-cannot-find"&gt;Information you cannot find&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot find the information you need, it may have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;published in &lt;a href="/government/publications?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;topics%5B%5D=all&amp;amp;departments%5B%5D=driving-standards-agency&amp;amp;publication_type=foi-releases" title="Responses to FOI requests"&gt;response to an Freedom of Information (&lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt;) request&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;designated as an &lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/driving-tests-and-instructors-statistics" title="Official driving test statistics"&gt;official statistic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/form/" title="Send an FOI request"&gt;send an &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; request&lt;/a&gt; if you still cannot find the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="information-that-cannot-be-released"&gt;Information that cannot be released&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; cannot send you information if it is part of an official statistic that has not yet been published. This is because the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/2998/contents/made" title="Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008"&gt;Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008&lt;/a&gt; limits access to official statistics until they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="downloads"&gt;Downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These older statistics are available from the The National Archives:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Right to buy sales in England: 2012 to 2013 - quarters 1 and 2</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of dwellings under the right to buy scheme, as well as providing statistics on receipts resulting from those sales, and starts on site as part of the one-for-one replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Concessionary Travel Statistics: England, 2011-12 and 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents information on concessionary travel on buses in England during 2011/12 and 2012/13. The main focus of the release is free bus travel for older and disabled people, but it also includes information relating to concessions on other transport modes and young people’s concessions. Most of the data are derived from the Department for Transport’s survey of Travel Concession Authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome any feedback on these statistics via email to &lt;a href="mailto:bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="planned-update"&gt;Planned update:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional data relating to total expenditure on concessionary travel will be released later in November, as soon as the latest data is available from the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-points"&gt;Key points:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011/12, there were around 9.8m older and disabled concessionary bus passes in England, with an average of 109 bus journeys per pass per year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pass numbers in England are forecast to increase by 3% in 2012/13, according to forecasts by Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel concession authorities (TCAs) paid £898m in 2011/12 to reimburse bus operators for concessionary journeys by older and disabled people, a fall of 2% in real terms since 2010/11. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average reimbursement per concessionary journey in 2011/12 was 84 pence, a fall of 3 pence per journey in real terms, compared to 2010/11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, 87 of the 89 travel concession authorities (TCAs) outside London offer some discretionary travel concessions, most commonly concessions for companions to disabled people and extensions to the statutory travel time period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, in all but 5 TCAs in England, some travel concession is available for young people, offered by either the TCA or on a commercial basis by bus operators. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Biofuel statistics: Year 5 (2012/13), report 1</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2012 to 14 July 2012 (Year 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon and sustainability (C&amp;amp;S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-headline-figures-are"&gt;The headline figures are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6.3 billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 51 months since the RTFO began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-the-first-quarter-of-year-5-of-the-rtfo-14-april-2012-to-15-july-2012"&gt;In the first quarter of Year 5 of the RTFO (14 April 2012 to 15 July 2012):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;321 million litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 2.9% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More bioethanol (60%) has been supplied than biodiesel (36%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and pure vegetable oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;154 million RTFCs have been issued of which 69 million were for double counting feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="cs-characteristics-of-the-biofuels-to-which-rtfcs-have-been-issued-37-of-the-total-biofuel185"&gt;C&amp;amp;S characteristics of the biofuels to which RTFCs have been issued (37% of the total biofuel)¹:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from non-European Community corn (66 million litres, 55% of total biofuel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the USA (8 million litres, 31% of biodiesel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (65 million litres, 76% of bioethanol to which RTFCs have been issued).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 59% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;¹ The final deadline for applying for RTFCs is 12 August following the obligation period.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biofuel statistics: Year 4 (2011/12), report 5</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2011 to 14 April 2012 (Year 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon and sustainability (C&amp;amp;S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied ¹.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-headline-figures-are"&gt;The headline figures are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 48 months since the RTFO began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-year-4-14-april-2011-to-15-april-2012-of-the-rtfo"&gt;In Year 4 (14 April 2011 to 15 April 2012) of the RTFO:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.6 billion litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 3.6% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.0%. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More biodiesel (57%) has been supplied than bioethanol (43%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol and pure vegetable oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.7 billion RTFCs have been issued of which 464 million were for double counting feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="from-15-dec-2011-to-14-apr-2012"&gt;From 15 Dec 2011 to 14 Apr 2012:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43% of the Year 4 RTFCs were issued to biofuel supplied in this period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from used cooking oil (229 million litres, 45% of total biofuel supplied). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the Netherlands (48 million litres, 18% of biodiesel supplied). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (163 million litres, 69% of bioethanol supplied).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 63% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;¹ This report contains fuel volume and RTFC data for the whole obligation period, and verified C&amp;amp;S data on renewable fuels supplied for the period after implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive (15 December 2011 to 14 April 2012). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unverified C&amp;amp;S data for renewable fuels supplied for the period 15 April to 14 December 2011 can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/biofuels-statistics"&gt;Biofuels series&lt;/a&gt;. We expect to publish verified data for this period in February 2013&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local authority borrowing and investments 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Local Authority Borrowing and Investments statistics produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government were released on Thursday 13 September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total gross borrowing of the local government sector rose 16 per cent in the past year from £70.6bn to £81.8bn at the end of 2011-12. This represented a 33 per cent increase over five years from £61.4bn at the end of 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;excluding the one-off Housing Revenue Account (HRA) settlement of a net £8.1bn, total borrowing would have been £73.7bn at the end of 2011-12, a 5 per cent increase from 2010-11 and 20 per cent since 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99 per cent of borrowing is longer-term; of this longer-term borrowing 75 per cent was with the Public Works Loan Board&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;total investments rose from £25.1bn at the end of 2010-11 to £26.1bn at the end of 2011-12, an increase of 4 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as at 31 March 2012, 62 per cent of all investments were with banks and building societies, a decrease from 69 per cent at 31 March 2011&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Local authority revenue expenditure and financing in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the provisional outturn estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for 2011-12 were released on 30 August 2012 under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue expenditure by local authorities in England was £99.9 billion in 2011-12, a decrease from £104.3 billion in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26.5 per cent of revenue expenditure in 2011-12 was funded through council tax, 29.5 per cent through formula grant and 46.5 per cent through specific grants inside Aggregate External Finance and Local Services Support Grant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12 local authorities added £2.6 billion to their reserves. This includes figures for Greater London Authority, who added £0.6 billion to their reserves. Excluding GLA, authorities added £2.0 billion to their reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local Authorities net current expenditure for education services was £40.2 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education expenditure for 2011-12 is not comparable to previous years due to a number of schools changing their status to become academies, which are centrally funded rather than funded by local authorities. There has also been a transfer of responsibilities between NHS and local government relating to adults with learning difficulties in long stay NHS institutions. As a result of this discontinuity between the two financial years (2010-11 &amp;amp; 2011-12), it is difficult to compare total net current expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Driver and rider tests and instructor statistics: quarter 1 2012/13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents information on the number and pass rates of driving and riding tests conducted in Great Britain to 31st June 2012 (beginning of the 2012/13 financial year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics are derived from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test and training schemes in Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 410,778 tests were conducted across all test categories between April and June 2012 (Q1 2012/13). This is a decrease of 4.9 per cent in comparison with the same quarter in 2011/12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reduction in the number of tests conducted in quarter 1 2012/13 is likely to have been due to the continuing economic situation and the Jubilee long weekend at the beginning of June 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The practical car test pass rate was unchanged from quarter 1 2011/12, at 47 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end of the quarter there were 46,313 approved driving instructors on the Register.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Local area walking and cycling in England, 2010/11</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Statistical Release presents information on walking and cycling amongst adults (aged 16 and over) in England, by local area. &lt;strong&gt;This is the first release in this series of statistics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics in this release are based on results from the Active People Survey (APS), an annual household telephone survey administered by Sport England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% of adults cycle at least once per week. This figure varies significantly by area, from over 50% to less than 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11% of adults cycle for at least half an hour, at least once per month. Across different areas, this proportion ranges from 35% to 4%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amongst those who do some cycling for at least half an hour, 16% always do so for utility purposes (getting from place to place), rather than for recreation or health reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;71% of adults walk for at least half an hour, at least once per month. Across different areas, this proportion ranges from over 80% to around 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;23% of those who do some walking for at least half an hour do so exclusively for utility purposes. The share of utility walking is highest in London, where 35% of those who walk do so only for utility purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
