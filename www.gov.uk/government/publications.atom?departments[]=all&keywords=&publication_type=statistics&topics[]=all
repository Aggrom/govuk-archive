    <title>National non-domestic rates collected by local authorities in England 2011-12 (update)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated statistical release giving details of the national non-domestic rates collected by local authorities in England in 2011-12 was published on 20 November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provided updated information on figures that were announced on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-domestic-rates-collected-by-local-councils-in-england-2011-to-2012"&gt;15 August 2012&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2007-08 to 2011-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the net rate yield (after allowances for changes in respect of previous years and reliefs) increased by 9.1% to £21 billion in 2011-12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the contribution to the pool (net rate yield after allowances for collection costs including losses) also increased by 9.2% to £20.7 billion in 2011-12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;between 2007-08 and 2011-12 the contribution to the pool from the local lists increased by £3.5 billion or 21%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London accounts for 29% of the contribution to the national pool while having only 15% of the population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Council Taxbase 2012 in England</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2008 to 2012 updating those &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/council-taxbase-2011-in-england"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; previously issued on 16 November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="number-of-dwellings"&gt;Number of dwellings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In England there were 22.4 million dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list liable for council tax as at 10 September 2012. This is an increase of 1% compared with 2011 and an increase of 3% compared with 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of dwellings on the valuation list that are exempt from council tax increased by 2% compared with 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35% of all exemptions from council tax are class C (short term vacant dwellings). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 27% of all exemptions are class M or N (student related exemptions). Of these, class M exemptions have increased by more than 48% in the period 2008 to 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of class L exemptions (unoccupied dwellings repossessed by a mortgage lender) again fell between September 2011 and September 2012 to 9,400, the four consecutive annual fall. There are now 6,500 (or 41%) fewer class L exemptions than the peak in 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7.7 million dwellings were entitled to a discount as a result of being occupied by single adults. This represents 33% of all dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2.7 million Band A dwellings (50% of all dwellings liable to Band A council tax) were entitled to a single adults discount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The total number of dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list in England as at 10 September 2012 was 23.2 million, an increase of 143,000, or 1% compared with 2011. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="empty-properties"&gt;Empty properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 2011 and 2012 the number of long-term empty dwellings subject to a discount fell by 28,000 (or 22%). In the same period the number of long-term empty dwellings not subject to a discount increased by 8,000 (or 5%). This gives a net reduction of 20,000, or 7%, in the total number of long term empty dwellings between 2011 and 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of long term empty dwellings that were subject to a discount has fallen by 86,000, or 47%, between 2008 and 2012. In the same period the number of long term empty dwellings that do not receive a discount has increased by 18,000 or 13%. This gives a net reduction of 68,000, or 21%, in the total number of long term empty dwellings between 2008 and 2012. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since the introduction of the New Homes Bonus in the summer of 2010 a large number of authorities have taken the opportunity to review the empty properties and second homes in their area. A number have also altered the level of discount awarded with many abolishing the discount for empty properties altogether.&lt;/li&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affordable-housing-starts-and-completions-funded-by-the-hca-and-the-gla-april-to-september-2012-13"/>
    <title>Affordable housing starts and completions funded by the HCA and the GLA - April to September 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics on affordable housing starts and completions funded by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and the Greater London Authority (GLA) were released on Friday 16 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures show the supply of homes delivered under the accelerated land disposal programme, the 2011-15 affordable homes programme (including the affordable homes programme, empty homes, homelessness change, mortgage rescue and traveller pitch funding), the economic assets programme, firstbuy, the get Britain building programme, the kickstart housing delivery programme, the national affordable housing programme and the property and regeneration programme. Details about these programmes can be found in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;HCA Housing statistics release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 3,735 affordable housing starts on site delivered in England through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents an increase of 678 per cent compared to the 480 (revised) started in the same period of the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 11,432 affordable housing completions delivered through programmes through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents a decrease of 11 per cent compared to the 12,778 completed in the same period in the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on the number of affordable homes delivered under the HCA affordable housing programmes is published twice a year. From April 2012, the Mayor of London has had strategic oversight of housing, regeneration and economic development in London. This means that the HCA no longer publish affordable housing starts and completions for London and this responsibility has been taken over by the GLA. DCLG combines data from the HCA and the GLA to publish six monthly affordable housing starts and completions delivered nationally under the affordable housing programmes of the HCA and GLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the HCA affordable housing statistics, see their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operational statistics about Driver Certificate of Professional (&lt;abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence"&gt;CPC&lt;/abbr&gt;) modules and training have not been designated as an official statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics come from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;), and are compiled and published by staff in &lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="information-you-cannot-find"&gt;Information you cannot find&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot find the information you need, it may have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;published in &lt;a href="/government/publications?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;topics%5B%5D=all&amp;amp;departments%5B%5D=driving-standards-agency&amp;amp;publication_type=foi-releases" title="Responses to FOI requests"&gt;response to an Freedom of Information (&lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt;) request&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;designated as an &lt;a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/driving-tests-and-instructors-statistics" title="Official driving test statistics"&gt;official statistic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/form/" title="Send an FOI request"&gt;send an &lt;abbr title="Freedom of Information"&gt;FOI&lt;/abbr&gt; request&lt;/a&gt; if you still cannot find the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="information-that-cannot-be-released"&gt;Information that cannot be released&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Driving Standards Agency"&gt;DSA&lt;/abbr&gt; cannot send you information if it is part of an official statistic that has not yet been published. This is because the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/2998/contents/made" title="Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008"&gt;Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008&lt;/a&gt; limits access to official statistics until they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Concessionary Travel Statistics: England, 2011-12 and 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents information on concessionary travel on buses in England during 2011/12 and 2012/13. The main focus of the release is free bus travel for older and disabled people, but it also includes information relating to concessions on other transport modes and young people’s concessions. Most of the data are derived from the Department for Transport’s survey of Travel Concession Authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome any feedback on these statistics via email to &lt;a href="mailto:bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="planned-update"&gt;Planned update:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional data relating to total expenditure on concessionary travel will be released later in November, as soon as the latest data is available from the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-points"&gt;Key points:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011/12, there were around 9.8m older and disabled concessionary bus passes in England, with an average of 109 bus journeys per pass per year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pass numbers in England are forecast to increase by 3% in 2012/13, according to forecasts by Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel concession authorities (TCAs) paid £898m in 2011/12 to reimburse bus operators for concessionary journeys by older and disabled people, a fall of 2% in real terms since 2010/11. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average reimbursement per concessionary journey in 2011/12 was 84 pence, a fall of 3 pence per journey in real terms, compared to 2010/11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, 87 of the 89 travel concession authorities (TCAs) outside London offer some discretionary travel concessions, most commonly concessions for companions to disabled people and extensions to the statutory travel time period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, in all but 5 TCAs in England, some travel concession is available for young people, offered by either the TCA or on a commercial basis by bus operators. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average speed achieved during the weekday morning peak on locally managed ‘A’ roads in England between September 2011 and July 2012 was 25.3 mph. This is 0.8% faster than the average speed observed last year, and 2.6% faster than the average speed achieved during 2006/07.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The largest speed increases relative to last year were observed in November 2011, December 2011 and January 2012, whereas April 2012 and July 2012 saw drops in average speed when compared to last year’s figures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provisionally, the average speed achieved over the morning peak during September 2012 was 25.1 mph, 1.2% slower than the previous September.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Biofuel statistics: Year 5 (2012/13), report 1</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2012 to 14 July 2012 (Year 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carbon and sustainability (C&amp;amp;S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-headline-figures-are"&gt;The headline figures are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6.3 billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 51 months since the RTFO began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="in-the-first-quarter-of-year-5-of-the-rtfo-14-april-2012-to-15-july-2012"&gt;In the first quarter of Year 5 of the RTFO (14 April 2012 to 15 July 2012):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;321 million litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 2.9% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More bioethanol (60%) has been supplied than biodiesel (36%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and pure vegetable oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;154 million RTFCs have been issued of which 69 million were for double counting feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="cs-characteristics-of-the-biofuels-to-which-rtfcs-have-been-issued-37-of-the-total-biofuel185"&gt;C&amp;amp;S characteristics of the biofuels to which RTFCs have been issued (37% of the total biofuel)¹:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from non-European Community corn (66 million litres, 55% of total biofuel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the USA (8 million litres, 31% of biodiesel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (65 million litres, 76% of bioethanol to which RTFCs have been issued).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 59% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;¹ The final deadline for applying for RTFCs is 12 August following the obligation period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43% of the Year 4 RTFCs were issued to biofuel supplied in this period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from used cooking oil (229 million litres, 45% of total biofuel supplied). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the Netherlands (48 million litres, 18% of biodiesel supplied). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (163 million litres, 69% of bioethanol supplied).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 63% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Local authority borrowing and investments 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Local Authority Borrowing and Investments statistics produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government were released on Thursday 13 September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total gross borrowing of the local government sector rose 16 per cent in the past year from £70.6bn to £81.8bn at the end of 2011-12. This represented a 33 per cent increase over five years from £61.4bn at the end of 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;excluding the one-off Housing Revenue Account (HRA) settlement of a net £8.1bn, total borrowing would have been £73.7bn at the end of 2011-12, a 5 per cent increase from 2010-11 and 20 per cent since 2006-07&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;99 per cent of borrowing is longer-term; of this longer-term borrowing 75 per cent was with the Public Works Loan Board&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;total investments rose from £25.1bn at the end of 2010-11 to £26.1bn at the end of 2011-12, an increase of 4 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as at 31 March 2012, 62 per cent of all investments were with banks and building societies, a decrease from 69 per cent at 31 March 2011&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Fire and rescue authorities in England: operational statistics bulletin for 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication and accompanying appendix data tables were released on Tuesday 25 September 2012 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. The publication focuses on personnel, health and safety and fire safety for the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="numbers-of-staff"&gt;Numbers of staff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 31 March 2012, the total number of fire and rescue authority staff (full-time equivalents) was 48,900: 4% fewer than at 31 March 2011. There were 28,200 whole-time firefighter full-time equivalents (down 3% on 2011) and 11,700 retained firefighter units of 24-hour cover (down 4% on 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a gradual increase in the representation of women and minority ethnic staff in recent years. At 31 March 2012, 4.3% of firefighters were women compared with 1.7% in 2002. Minority ethnic staff accounted for 3.3% of firefighters compared with 1.5% in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="staff-leaving-fire-and-rescue-authorities"&gt;Staff leaving fire and rescue authorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2011 to 2012 there were 4,200 staff who left fire and rescue authorities. The most common reason for leaving was normal retirement (800).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="health-and-safety"&gt;Health and safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 3,400 reported injuries to firefighters in 2011 to 2012. This is 45% fewer injuries than in 2001 to 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="community-fire-safety"&gt;Community fire safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;770,000 home fire safety checks were carried out by fire and rescue services and their partners in 2011 to 2012, 7% fewer than in 2010 to 2011. There were 118,000 home fire safety checks to households with a disabled person in 2011 to 2012, up from 87,000 in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of home fire safety checks of households with an elderly person (over 65 years) was 272,000 in 2011 to 2012, slightly lower than the 278,000 undertaken in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fire-safety-audits-of-buildings"&gt;Fire safety audits of buildings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue services carried out 82,000 audits of buildings in 2011 to 2012, 3% fewer than in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities are focusing their audit activities so that premises that are considered to represent the highest risks are more likely to be audited. The highest proportions of audits against number of known premises were care homes, hotels and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall proportion of premises found to be satisfactory in 2011 to 2012 was 59%, compared to 56% in 2010 to 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
