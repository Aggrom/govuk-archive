    <title>Local authority green belt statistics for England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the extent of the green belt in England were released under the auspices of the UK Statistics Authority on 30 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The extent of the designated green belt land in England in 2011/12 was estimated at 1,639,410 hectares, about 13% of the land area of England. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overall there has been a decrease of 130 hectares from the revised 2010-11 green belt. This is due to three authorities who have adopted new plans in which they have changed the boundaries of the green belt. This represents a decrease of less than 0.01% per cent in the total green belt area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since these statistics were first compiled for 1997, there has been an increase in the area of green belt after taking account of the redesignation of some green belt as part of the New Forest National Park in 2005.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Road freight statistics: quarter 1 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents quarterly information on the domestic and international road freight activity of UK hauliers and of foreign hauliers in UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information is based on results from the following three continuous surveys administered by the Department for Transport:
* Continuing Survey of Road Goods Transport Great Britain (CSRGT GB)
* Continuing Survey of Road Goods Transport Northern Ireland (CSRGT NI)
* International Road Haulage Survey (IRHS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics on foreign hauliers in the UK are derived from data supplied to Eurostat by EU-27 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Q1 2011 data in this publication are provisional and will be finalised in an annual Road Freight Statistics publication in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between Q1 2010 and Q1 2011, goods moved by UK HGVs in the UK increased by 6% to over 37 billion tonne kilometres. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domestic freight activity trends for the UK in recent years broadly mirror those in three of the four other largest EU economies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Q1 2011, there were 1.3 million tonnes of road freight exported from the UK by UK-registered vehicles. This was an increase of 9 per cent compared to Q1 2010. There was a similar weight of goods imported in Q1 2011 (1.4 million tonnes).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011, there were about 1 billion tonne kilometres of cabotage by foreign hauliers in the UK. Levels of cabotage reported by EU-27 countries in the UK have declined in recent years. The level was 44% lower in 2011 than in 2005.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="technical-information"&gt;Technical information:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on road freight statistics and the three DfT surveys, as well as the pre-release access list, and related technical documentation &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/technical-guidance-for-transport-statistics-part-2#road-freight-statistics"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Driver and rider tests and instructor statistics: quarter 2 2012/13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents information on the number and pass rates of driving and riding practical tests conducted in Great Britain for the quarter to 30 September 2012 and statistics from the Approved Driving Instructor register and the Integrated Register of Driver Trainers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test and instructor statistics are derived from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test and training schemes in Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 421,374 tests were conducted across all test categories between July and September 2012 (quarter 2 2012/13). This is a decrease of 5.3% in comparison to the same quarter last year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reduction in the number of tests conducted in quarter 2 2012/13 is likely to have been due to the continuing economic situation, national events such as the Olympics, and pass rate improvement in the car practical test leading to fewer retests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test categories included are B (car), B1 (tricycles and quadricycles), A, A1 and A2 (motorcycles), C, C1 (medium and large goods vehicles), C+E, C1+E (medium/large goods vehicles with trailers), D, D1 (minibuses and buses), D+E and D1+E (minibuses/buses with trailers).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local authority revenue expenditure and financing in England: 2011 to 2012 final outturn</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the final outturn estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for 2011-12 were released on 27 November 2012 under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue expenditure by local authorities in England was Â£99.3 billion in 2011-12, a decrease from Â£104.3 billion in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26.6% of revenue expenditure in 2011-12 was funded through council tax, 29.7% through formula grant and 46.1% through specific grants inside aggregate external finance and local services support grant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12 local authorities added Â£2.6 billion to their reserves. This includes figures for the Greater London Authority (GLA), who added Â£0.6 billion to their reserves. Excluding GLA, authorities added Â£2.0 billion to their reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities net current expenditure for education services was Â£40.2 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education expenditure for 2011-12 is not comparable to previous years due to a number of schools changing their status to become academies, which are centrally funded rather than funded by local authorities. There has also been a transfer of responsibilities between the NHS and local government relating to adults with learning difficulties in long stay NHS institutions. As a result of this discontinuity between the two financial years (2010-11 and 2011-12), it is difficult to compare total net current expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rolling-annual-total"&gt;Rolling Annual total&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 2.43 million goods vehicles travelling from Great Britain to mainland Europe in the four quarters ending Q3 2012. This is a 2.4% decline compared to the four quarters ending Q3 2011 and 16% lower than the peak in 2007. However, the number of goods vehicles travelling from Great Britain to mainland Europe has increased by over 70% in the last 20 years.    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Of these goods vehicles, 1.81 million were powered vehicles and 622 thousand were unaccompanied trailers. Both powered vehicles and unaccompanied trailers have fallen compared to the four quarters ending Q3 2011 by 0.9% and 6.7% respectively.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="quarter-3-2012"&gt;Quarter 3 2012&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During quarter 3 2012, 611 thousand goods vehicles travelled from Great Britain to mainland Europe, of which 452 thousand were powered vehicles (an increase of 3.5% on Q3 2011) and 158 thousand were unaccompanied trailers (down 3.1% on Q3 2011). 452 thousand of these goods vehicles were powered vehicles and 154 thousand were unaccompanied trailers, down 2% and 9% respectively on Q2 2011.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>National non-domestic rates collected by local authorities in England 2011-12 (update)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated statistical release giving details of the national non-domestic rates collected by local authorities in England in 2011-12 was published on 20 November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provided updated information on figures that were announced on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-domestic-rates-collected-by-local-councils-in-england-2011-to-2012"&gt;15 August 2012&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2007-08 to 2011-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the net rate yield (after allowances for changes in respect of previous years and reliefs) increased by 9.1% to Â£21 billion in 2011-12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the contribution to the pool (net rate yield after allowances for collection costs including losses) also increased by 9.2% to Â£20.7 billion in 2011-12&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;between 2007-08 and 2011-12 the contribution to the pool from the local lists increased by Â£3.5 billion or 21%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London accounts for 29% of the contribution to the national pool while having only 15% of the population&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Council Taxbase 2012 in England</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics release includes data from 2008 to 2012 updating those &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/council-taxbase-2011-in-england"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; previously issued on 16 November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="number-of-dwellings"&gt;Number of dwellings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In England there were 22.4 million dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list liable for council tax as at 10 September 2012. This is an increase of 1% compared with 2011 and an increase of 3% compared with 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of dwellings on the valuation list that are exempt from council tax increased by 2% compared with 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35% of all exemptions from council tax are class C (short term vacant dwellings). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 27% of all exemptions are class M or N (student related exemptions). Of these, class M exemptions have increased by more than 48% in the period 2008 to 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of class L exemptions (unoccupied dwellings repossessed by a mortgage lender) again fell between September 2011 and September 2012 to 9,400, the four consecutive annual fall. There are now 6,500 (or 41%) fewer class L exemptions than the peak in 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7.7 million dwellings were entitled to a discount as a result of being occupied by single adults. This represents 33% of all dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2.7 million Band A dwellings (50% of all dwellings liable to Band A council tax) were entitled to a single adults discount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The total number of dwellings on the Valuation Office valuation list in England as at 10 September 2012 was 23.2 million, an increase of 143,000, or 1% compared with 2011. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="empty-properties"&gt;Empty properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 2011 and 2012 the number of long-term empty dwellings subject to a discount fell by 28,000 (or 22%). In the same period the number of long-term empty dwellings not subject to a discount increased by 8,000 (or 5%). This gives a net reduction of 20,000, or 7%, in the total number of long term empty dwellings between 2011 and 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of long term empty dwellings that were subject to a discount has fallen by 86,000, or 47%, between 2008 and 2012. In the same period the number of long term empty dwellings that do not receive a discount has increased by 18,000 or 13%. This gives a net reduction of 68,000, or 21%, in the total number of long term empty dwellings between 2008 and 2012. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since the introduction of the New Homes Bonus in the summer of 2010 a large number of authorities have taken the opportunity to review the empty properties and second homes in their area. A number have also altered the level of discount awarded with many abolishing the discount for empty properties altogether.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Affordable housing starts and completions funded by the HCA and the GLA - April to September 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest statistics on affordable housing starts and completions funded by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) and the Greater London Authority (GLA) were released on Friday 16 November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures show the supply of homes delivered under the accelerated land disposal programme, the 2011-15 affordable homes programme (including the affordable homes programme, empty homes, homelessness change, mortgage rescue and traveller pitch funding), the economic assets programme, firstbuy, the get Britain building programme, the kickstart housing delivery programme, the national affordable housing programme and the property and regeneration programme. Details about these programmes can be found in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;HCA Housing statistics release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 3,735 affordable housing starts on site delivered in England through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents an increase of 678 per cent compared to the 480 (revised) started in the same period of the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Between 1 April and 30 September 2012, there were 11,432 affordable housing completions delivered through programmes through programmes managed by the HCA and the GLA. This represents a decrease of 11 per cent compared to the 12,778 completed in the same period in the previous year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information on the number of affordable homes delivered under the HCA affordable housing programmes is published twice a year. From April 2012, the Mayor of London has had strategic oversight of housing, regeneration and economic development in London. This means that the HCA no longer publish affordable housing starts and completions for London and this responsibility has been taken over by the GLA. DCLG combines data from the HCA and the GLA to publish six monthly affordable housing starts and completions delivered nationally under the affordable housing programmes of the HCA and GLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about the HCA affordable housing statistics, see their &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/housing-statistics"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social housing sales in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents official statistics on the number of sales of existing social housing stock in England for 2011 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social housing sales include sales under right to buy, preserved right to buy, right to acquire, social homebuy, other outright or shared equity sales to tenants, and sales of existing stock to the private sector. The figures exclude sales through low cost home ownership schemes where these do not relate to existing social stock, i.e. sales of newly built homes for shared ownership or acquisitions of private sector homes for affordable home ownership. Intra-tenure transfers between social housing providers are also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 9,670 total social housing sales in England in 2011-12. This is an increase of 15% on 2010-11 but continues the low level of sales seen since 2008-09. The increase was entirely due to an increase in private registered provider sales; local authority sales were virtually unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were an estimated 3,720 right to buy sales in England in 2011-12 (38% of all sales), a 1% increase from 2010-11. Most (70%) right to buy sales were of local authority properties. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average market value of a local authority property purchased through right to buy in 2011-12 was Â£100,040. Average capital receipts were Â£73,350 and the average discount was Â£26,690 per property. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Registered provider sales in 2011-12 included 140 properties sold through the right to acquire scheme (compared to 200 in 2010-11) and 40 through social homebuy (compared to 110 in 2010-11).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A further 3,320 sales (34% of total sales) were disposals of registered provider properties to the private sector. Other shared equity and outright sales of existing stock accounted for the remaining sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate to right to buy sales by local authorities and registered providers. The statistics include sales under the right to buy and preserved right to buy schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Key points from the release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 444 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 1. In this quarter local authorities received Â£24 million from right to buy sales, while 14 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local authorities sold an estimated 1,043 dwellings under the right to buy scheme in 2012-13 quarter 2. In this quarter local authorities received Â£62 million from right to buy sales, while 234 dwellings were started on site or acquired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics relate only to sales by local authorities under the right to buy scheme, excluding sales by registered providers under preserved right to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted completions fell, down 7% to 27,060 in the September quarter 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private enterprise housing starts (seasonally adjusted) were 15% higher in the September quarter 2012 than the previous quarter, whilst starts by housing associations were 23% higher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted private enterprise completions fell by 6% and housing association completions fell by 14% from the previous quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seasonally adjusted starts are now 52% above the trough in the March quarter 2009 but 45% below the December quarter 2005 peak. Completions are 44% below their March quarter 2007 peak.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Concessionary Travel Statistics: England, 2011-12 and 2012-13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statistical release presents information on concessionary travel on buses in England during 2011/12 and 2012/13. The main focus of the release is free bus travel for older and disabled people, but it also includes information relating to concessions on other transport modes and young peopleâ€™s concessions. Most of the data are derived from the Department for Transportâ€™s survey of Travel Concession Authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome any feedback on these statistics via email to &lt;a href="mailto:bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;bus.statistics@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="planned-update"&gt;Planned update:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional data relating to total expenditure on concessionary travel will be released later in November, as soon as the latest data is available from the Department for Communities and Local Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="key-points"&gt;Key points:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2011/12, there were around 9.8m older and disabled concessionary bus passes in England, with an average of 109 bus journeys per pass per year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pass numbers in England are forecast to increase by 3% in 2012/13, according to forecasts by Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel concession authorities (TCAs) paid Â£898m in 2011/12 to reimburse bus operators for concessionary journeys by older and disabled people, a fall of 2% in real terms since 2010/11. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average reimbursement per concessionary journey in 2011/12 was 84 pence, a fall of 3 pence per journey in real terms, compared to 2010/11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, 87 of the 89 travel concession authorities (TCAs) outside London offer some discretionary travel concessions, most commonly concessions for companions to disabled people and extensions to the statutory travel time period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2012/13, in all but 5 TCAs in England, some travel concession is available for young people, offered by either the TCA or on a commercial basis by bus operators. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Annual bus statistics: 2011-12</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the data are derived from the Departmentâ€™s main annual survey of bus and coach operators. Information on revenue, costs and government support for buses will be added on 13 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="passenger-journeys"&gt;Passenger journeys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were 5.2 billion bus passenger journeys in Great Britain in 2011/12, a slight (0.6%) increase on the previous year, with 4.7 billion of these journeys in England.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 2011/12 figures broadly show a continuation of recent trends, with patronage increasing in London and the south of England but falling elsewhere. Journeys in London now account for half of all bus passenger journeys in England.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="vehicle-miles"&gt;Vehicle miles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bus vehicle miles in Great Britain fell slightly, by 1.3% between 2010/11 and 2011/12 with a 0.8% fall in England.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mileage on services financially supported by local authorities in England outside London fell by 9% over the same period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="vehicles-and-staff"&gt;Vehicles and staff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local bus operators in Great Britain operated 42 thousand buses and employed 124 thousand staff in 2011/12. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The proportion of buses which are disability accessible or low floor designs continues to increase steadily, to 88% in 2011/12.  &lt;/li&gt;
