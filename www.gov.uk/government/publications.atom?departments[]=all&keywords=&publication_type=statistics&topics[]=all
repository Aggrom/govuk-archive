    <title>Local authority revenue expenditure and financing in England: 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest national statistics on the provisional outturn estimates of local authority revenue expenditure and financing for 2011-12 were released on 30 August 2012 under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue expenditure by local authorities in England was £99.9 billion in 2011-12, a decrease from £104.3 billion in 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;26.5 per cent of revenue expenditure in 2011-12 was funded through council tax, 29.5 per cent through formula grant and 46.5 per cent through specific grants inside Aggregate External Finance and Local Services Support Grant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2011-12 local authorities added £2.6 billion to their reserves. This includes figures for Greater London Authority, who added £0.6 billion to their reserves. Excluding GLA, authorities added £2.0 billion to their reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local Authorities net current expenditure for education services was £40.2 billion in 2011-12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education expenditure for 2011-12 is not comparable to previous years due to a number of schools changing their status to become academies, which are centrally funded rather than funded by local authorities. There has also been a transfer of responsibilities between NHS and local government relating to adults with learning difficulties in long stay NHS institutions. As a result of this discontinuity between the two financial years (2010-11 &amp;amp; 2011-12), it is difficult to compare total net current expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driver and rider tests and instructor statistics: quarter 1 2012/13</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This publication presents information on the number and pass rates of driving and riding tests conducted in Great Britain to 31st June 2012 (beginning of the 2012/13 financial year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics are derived from data held by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which administers the driving test and training schemes in Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 410,778 tests were conducted across all test categories between April and June 2012 (Q1 2012/13). This is a decrease of 4.9 per cent in comparison with the same quarter in 2011/12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reduction in the number of tests conducted in quarter 1 2012/13 is likely to have been due to the continuing economic situation and the Jubilee long weekend at the beginning of June 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The practical car test pass rate was unchanged from quarter 1 2011/12, at 47 per cent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end of the quarter there were 46,313 approved driving instructors on the Register.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Local area walking and cycling in England, 2010/11</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Statistical Release presents information on walking and cycling amongst adults (aged 16 and over) in England, by local area. &lt;strong&gt;This is the first release in this series of statistics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics in this release are based on results from the Active People Survey (APS), an annual household telephone survey administered by Sport England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% of adults cycle at least once per week. This figure varies significantly by area, from over 50% to less than 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;11% of adults cycle for at least half an hour, at least once per month. Across different areas, this proportion ranges from 35% to 4%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amongst those who do some cycling for at least half an hour, 16% always do so for utility purposes (getting from place to place), rather than for recreation or health reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;71% of adults walk for at least half an hour, at least once per month. Across different areas, this proportion ranges from over 80% to around 60%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;23% of those who do some walking for at least half an hour do so exclusively for utility purposes. The share of utility walking is highest in London, where 35% of those who walk do so only for utility purposes.&lt;/li&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homelessness-prevention-and-relief-england-2011-to-2012"/>
    <title>Homelessness prevention and relief: England 2011 to 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an official statistics release on homelessness prevention and relief in England that took place outside the homelessness statutory framework in 2011 to 2012. This is the 4th year for which figures on homelessness prevention and relief have been published by the Department for Communities and Local Government under arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the previous three releases were badged as ‘experimental’ official statistics in recognition that this is a relatively new data series, DCLG statisticians judge that the response rates and the quality of the figures received for 2011-12 have now improved enough for the ‘experimental’ label to now be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from the latest release are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, a total of 199,000 cases of homelessness prevention or relief are estimated to have taken place outside the statutory homelessness framework in England. Of these cases, 174,800 (88 per cent) were preventions and 24,200 (12 per cent) were cases of relief&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the total number of cases of homelessness prevention or relief increased by 5 per cent when compared to 2010-11. This is due to prevention cases increasing by 7 per cent, whilst cases of relief decreased by 2 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in 2011-12, 57 per cent of cases of homelessness prevention and relief involved the household being assisted to obtain alternative accommodation. The remaining 43 per cent involved the cases being assisted to remain in their existing home. This has not changed since 2010-11.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the most common action taken to prevent or relieve homelessness was the use of landlord incentive schemes to secure private rented sector accommodation. In 2011-12, 27,600 cases (14 per cent) were assisted in obtaining alternative accommodation this way, though this was a decrease of 10 per cent compared to 2010-11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the amount of homelessness prevention and relief activity varied across the regions. The North East had the highest rate of cases of prevention and relief with 11.8 cases per 1,000 households. The West Midlands (11.7 cases per 1,000 households), Yorkshire and the Humber (11.5) and the East Midlands (10.8) also had high rates of prevention and relief. The East of England, with 6.8 cases per 1,000 households, had the lowest rate.&lt;/li&gt;
