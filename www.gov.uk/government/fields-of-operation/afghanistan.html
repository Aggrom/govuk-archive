<p>It is with very deep regret that the Ministry of Defence has confirmed the following fatalities suffered during operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>As at 7 January 2013, a total of 439 British forces personnel or MOD civilians have died while serving in Afghanistan since the start of operations in October 2001.</p>

<p>Of these, 396 were killed as a result of hostile action.</p>

<p>43 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents, or have not yet officially been assigned a cause of death pending the outcome of an investigation. The balance of these figures may change as inquests are concluded.</p>
