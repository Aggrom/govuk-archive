    <title>Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) Annual Report 2010</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This annual report relates to the advisory work carried out by the Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) in 2010 and is the eleventh report published on behalf of the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRAC has continued to work closely with officials in the Department for Communities and Local Government to provide strategic and technical advice and views on a broad range of issues related to the Building Regulations and building standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year BRAC assisted the Department in giving their views and comments on a range of areas, including: The 2013 Review of Building Regulations; Consolidation of the Building Regulations 2010; Lifetime Home Standards; Reviews of Parts L (Conservation of Fuel and Power), F (Ventilation), and Part J (Combustion Appliances and Fuel Storage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reflects the work of the Committee in 2010, under the previous Government (until May 2010). It should not all necessarily be construed as a commentary of the current Government’s policy positions and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) Annual Report 2009</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This annual report relates to the advisory work carried out by the Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC) in 2009 and is the tenth report published on behalf of the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRAC has continued to work closely with officials in the Department for Communities and Local Government to provide strategic and technical advice and views on a broad range of issues related to the Building Regulations and building standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year BRAC assisted the Department in finalising the &lt;em&gt;Future of Building Control Implementation Plan&lt;/em&gt; and commented on a number of proposals aimed at developing the Competent Person Schemes framework. The Committee also ran a number of working parties to assist the Department in reviewing and developing proposals for amendments to Parts A and C, Parts G, J, L, F and M of the Building Regulations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in recent years BRAC also gave its views on sustainable buildings initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reflects the work of the Committee in 2009 under the last Government. It should not necessarily be construed as a commentary of the new Government’s policy positions and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
