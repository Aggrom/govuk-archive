    <title>Proposed transfer of Homes and Communities Agency functions and assets to Milton Keynes Council</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a request by Milton Keynes Council to take greater strategic control of growth and delivery in their area, they asked to acquire full control of planning functions. Currently the Homes and Community Agency is responsible for considering certain types of planning applications for specific areas of Milton Keynes (mainly the areas designated as ‘expansion areas’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many strands to this transfer package, this document seeks views on the transfer of those planning functions back to Milton Keynes Council only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Planning application fees</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper seeks views on proposed changes to the planning application fees regime which would decentralise responsibility for setting fees to local planning authorities. We also propose to allow authorities to charge for resubmitted applications and to set higher fees for retrospective applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals will help to reduce the subsidising of planning applications by local taxpayers. If accepted and approved by Parliament, the changes would be implemented from April 2011, with a 6-month transition period until October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Recognising professional architects' qualifications across the EU</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation looks at an amendment to the Architects Act 1997 (as amended) in relation to the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. These provisions set out how professionals can obtain recognition of their qualifications when moving between Nation States within the EU in order to support greater freedom of movement within the Single Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Architects Act sets out the basic criteria for automatic recognition of qualifications for architects. The way in which this part of the Act is currently drafted could have the potential to give rise to conditions prejudicial to the automatic recognition of qualifications held by other EU nationals who are seeking to practice as architects in the UK and who would be entitled to practice as architects in their home nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
