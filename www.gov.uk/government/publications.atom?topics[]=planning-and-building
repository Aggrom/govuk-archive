    <title>Changes to Temporary Stop Notices consultation</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation on proposals to improve councils' power to tackle unauthorised development.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation is on the proposal to revoke Statutory Instrument 2005/206 under the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/206/contents/made"&gt;Town and Country Planning (Temporary Stop Notice)(England) Regulations 2005&lt;/a&gt;. The regulation currently restricts councils use of Temporary Stop Notices on unauthorised sites where a caravan is used as a main residence. This can discourage local councils from serving stop notices where it may be beneficial to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this consultation would give local councils greater freedom to make a decision on the basis of local circumstances and on whether serving Temporary Stop Notices in respect of caravans used as main residences is appropriate. It will remain for local councils to consider the consequences of taking enforcement action and whether the action is necessary and proportionate in the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Conclusions and recommendations of the review of planning guidance led by Lord Taylor of Goss Moor.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/planning-practice-guidance-should-be-simpler"&gt;21 December 2012&lt;/a&gt; the government welcomed the report of the review of planning practice guidance led by Lord Taylor of Goss Moor, and announced a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-planning-practice-guidance"&gt;short consultation&lt;/a&gt; on the review group’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review group’s report makes recommendations as to the scope and form of practice guidance that should be provided in future by government to support effective planning; what new or updated practice guidance should be published, with clear priorities; and what guidance should be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>This report provides support to the evaluation work being carried out by the department on changes to the building regulations.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government commissioned EC Harris to provide economic and analytical information to support evaluation work being carried out by the department on changes to the building regulations due to come into force in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research project was to provide information to help inform impact assessments of potential changes to the building regulations in 2013. It also investigated the impact of other changes to the building regulations that are not currently being taken forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings. The requirements of the Directive were implemented on a phased basis by the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key requirements were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy performance certificate to be produced on the sale, rent or construction of a building&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;display energy certificate to be produced and displayed in large public buildings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;air conditioning equipment above a certain size to be inspected regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes have been made to the regulations, to transpose the requirements of a recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in England and Wales. The main requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013 and are summarised below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;property advertisements to include details of energy performance certificate rating where available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no longer a requirement to attach front page of the energy performance certificate to written material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extension of current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500m².  Unlike buildings larger than 1,000m²,  display energy certificates for smaller public buildings will be valid for 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;energy performance certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500m² where one has been previously issued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance documents have been revised to reflect the changes and can be viewed via the links above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new regulations consolidate all existing regulations which have been revoked. They are available at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/" title="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;legislation.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation proposes to amend guidance in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/costs-awards-in-appeals-and-other-planning-proceedings-circular-03-2009"&gt;Circular 03/09: Costs Awards in Appeals and Other Planning Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; in relation to statutory consultees and their advice at appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also announced clarifications to the guidance in relation to local councils and their development plan, and in relation to ensuring evidence submitted at appeal is manifestly accurate and truthful. The government is also requiring the 5 main statutory bodies to report on, and be accountable for their performance on dealing with planning applications as part of their individual Improvement Plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Overview of the consultation on changes to the building regulations system and details of various technical aspects of the regulations.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper sets out the detailed proposals on parts A, B, C, K, M and N, access statements, security, changing places toilet and regulation 7, and is section 1 of 4, relating to the 2012 building regulations consultation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 1 provides an overview of the consultation package as a whole as well as proposals on a number of areas including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacing the currently referenced standards in part A (structure) with the new British Standards based on Eurocodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;aligning the existing guidance in Approved Document C (site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture) with the most up-to-date radon maps to ensure the safety provisions are targeted appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarifying the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M (access to and use of buildings)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising the guidance supporting parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to remove unnecessary costs on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making minor changes to the technical guidance in Approved Document B (fire safety) to resolve practical problems in the application of requirement B2 (internal fire spread (linings))&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the intention to take forward the repeal of the fire protection provisions in the Local Acts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting out the non-regulatory approach proposed in relation to domestic security and changing places toilets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="draft-approved-documents"&gt;Draft Approved Documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published alongside this section of the consultation is a draft version of a new Approved Document K (protection from falling, collision and impact). Not only does this reflect the proposed changes resulting from the rationalisation of parts K, M and N, it also seeks consultees’ views on the proposed new style of Approved Documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new style has also been applied to a draft revised Approved Document regulation 7 which can be found in the main consultation document as annex I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="other-consultation-sections"&gt;Other consultation sections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other consultation sections cover the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-conservation-of-fuel-and-power"&gt;section 2: part L (conservation of fuel and power)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-electrical-safety"&gt;section 3: part P (electrical safety - dwellings)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-the-building-control-system"&gt;section 4: the building control system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation about changes to the building regulations that relate to the energy efficiency of buildings (part L).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation paper sets out the detailed proposals on part L of the building regulations. It is section 2 of 4 of the 2012 building regulations consultation exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes proposals for tighter carbon dioxide emission standards for new homes and non-domestic buildings, to take the next step towards zero carbon standards, plus tighter performance standards for works to existing buildings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper also contains proposals to introduce, on a phased basis, requirements for additional energy efficiency improvements to be carried out when other specified works (eg extensions) are planned and Green Deal finance is available as an option to meet the up-front costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other consultation sections are:&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) became part of EU law in December 2002. The EPBD has been implemented into law via the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/991 as amended) (“the 2007 regulations”) in respect of sales and lettings, and in regulation 29 to 33 of the Building Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2214 as amended or superseded) (the Building Regulations) in respect of the duty on construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulation 24 of the Building Regulations 2010 (the Building Regulations) requires the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (the Secretary of State) to approve a National Calculation Methodology (NCM) for calculating the energy performance of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All software that is used to assess the energy performance of buildings must be validated to ensure that it operates in a manner, and to a standard, consistent with the NCM before it can be approved by the Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please see the attached latest list of approved software for the production of non domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (DECs) and Air Conditioning Inspection Reports (ACIRs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Guidance for local planning authorities on implementing planning requirements of the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC)</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>A guidance note to ensure compliance with the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC).</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) (‘the Directive’) provides an overarching legislative framework for the management of waste across Europe. This guidance note provides advice on the measures required by local planning authorities to ensure compliance with the directive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guidance is aimed primarily at waste planning authorities, but it highlights the main legal and policy provisions of relevance to all planning authorities, and the action we expect them to take to assist them in ensuring compliance with the directive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be read alongside the government’s planning policy for waste management, currently set out in &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-for-sustainable-waste-management-planning-policy-statement-10"&gt;Planning Policy Statement 10&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-for-sustainable-waste-management-a-companion-guide-to-planning-policy-statement-10"&gt;companion guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the North West regional strategy: environmental report</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>Consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revoking the north west plan and the regional economic strategy.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environmental report is a consultation document on the likely significant environmental effects of revocation of the north west plan and the regional economic strategy (which together form the regional strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report succeeds the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919154703/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/revocationnwrss"&gt;previous environmental report&lt;/a&gt; on the revocation of the north west regional strategy which was consulted on between October 2011 and January 2012. It is a stand alone document the intention of which is to provide the reader with an up-to-date comprehensive assessment of the environmental effects of the revocation of the north west plan and the regional economic strategy without the need to refer back to the previous environmental report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note: Due to the size of the documents this publication can also be supplied on a CD-ROM. Please email requests to &lt;a href="mailto:SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;SEAConsultation@communities.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
