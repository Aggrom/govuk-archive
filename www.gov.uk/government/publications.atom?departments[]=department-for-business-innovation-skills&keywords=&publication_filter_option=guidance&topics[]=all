    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) is a loan guarantee scheme to facilitate additional lending to viable small and medium size enterprises lacking adequate security or proven track record for a normal commercial loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="key-points"&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme was launched in January 2009 to facilitate additional lending to viable businesses lacking adequate security or proven track record for a standard commercial loan. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 19,700 SMEs have been offered EFG loans with a total value in excess of £2 billion. 
EFG is a demand led scheme complimentary to commercial lending – not a replacement. EFG accounts for 1% to 2% of total SME lending.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Businesses that meet the basic eligibility criteria do not have an automatic entitlement to receive an EFG guaranteed loan.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decision making on individual loans is fully delegated to the participating lenders and is integrated with the commercial decision to lend. Where the lender determines the business is viable (able to meet the monthly loan repayments and repay the loan in full) but is lacking adequate security to meet the lenders standard lending requirements, they can consider providing a loan under EFG. The government plays no role in the loan decision process. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government provides the lender with a guarantee for 75% of each individual loan, subject to a cap set by an Annual Claim Limit. The borrower pays a 2% per annum pro-rata premium to BIS as a contribution towards the cost of providing the government guarantee. The borrower is responsible for repayment of 100% of the loan, not just the 25% outside the coverage of the government guarantee. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the case of default, lenders are required to follow their standard commercial recovery procedures, including the realisation of available security before a claim can be made against the guarantee. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under EFG, lenders are entitled to take security, including personal guarantees. This is standard commercial practice and an established mechanism for ensuring a degree of personal commitment to repayment of the loan by the business. In EFG this means there is a three-way risk sharing between borrower, lender and the government. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lenders are expressly prohibited from taking a charge over a principal private residence for an EFG facility. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="efg-eligibility-criteria"&gt;EFG eligibility criteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that meet the basic eligibility criteria do not have an automatic entitlement to receive an EFG guaranteed loan. Eligibility for EFG will be determined by the lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a guideline only. EFG is open to viable businesses that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operate in the UK &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a turnover of up to £41 million &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are seeking finance between £1,000 and £1million &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;repayment terms from 3 months to 10 years (less for overdraft and invoice finance facilities) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operate in a sector that is eligible for EFG (most sectors are eligible) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG is subject to certain sector restrictions arising from the EU de minimis State Aid rules under which it operates. A list of the main sector restrictions is provided in the EFG Business Sectors attachment below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Development Act 1982 provides the legal basis for EFG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that neither BIS nor Capital for Enterprise Ltd (CfEL) who oversees the running of EFG on behalf of BIS can advise on individual eligibility queries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="types-of-efg-facilities-available"&gt;Types of EFG facilities available&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following facilities are available under EFG, repayable over a period of 3 months to 10 years unless otherwise stated: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new term loans (unsecured and partially secured) for working capital or investment purposes including R&amp;amp;D. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;refinancing of existing term loans, where the loan is at risk due to deteriorating value of security or where for cash flow reasons the borrower is struggling to meet existing loan repayments. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conversion of part of or all an existing utilised overdraft onto a term loan in order to release capacity in the overdraft to meet working capital requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invoice finance guarantee providing a guarantee on invoice finance facilities to support an agreed additional advance on a SMEs debtor book, to supplement the invoice finance facility on commercial terms already in place (available for terms up to three years). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;overdraft guarantee providing a guarantee on new or increased overdraft borrowing where the SME is viable but has inadequate security to meet a lender’s normal requirements for the level of overdraft requested (available for terms up to two years). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that participating lenders are under no obligation to offer the full range of products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="application-process"&gt;Application process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses seeking debt finance can approach one or more of the participating lenders shown in the attachment below. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG loans typically require all the same information that banks need to process a commercial loan application. Participating lenders will advise you of their specific requirements (failure to provide the required information may delay the loan decision or lead to a loan decline). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenders will typically assess loan applications against their standard lending criteria to determine whether they wish to lend. Where the lender determines the business is viable (able to meet the monthly loan repayments and repay the loan in full) but is lacking adequate security to meet the lenders normal lending requirements, they can consider providing a loan under EFG. The government plays no role in the loan decision process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the lender has determined that use of EFG is likely to be appropriate, they confirm eligibility and record details of the borrower and their facility via a secure Web Portal. An overview of the EFG application process is available below.&lt;/p&gt;

          quoting your address, telephone number along with the title of the
          publication ("EFG Backed Loan Application Process").
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses that do not meet the lenders viability requirements are not suitable for EFG. EFG is intended to support lending to businesses which can ultimately repay their loan in full, not prop up unviable businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-government-guarantee"&gt;The government guarantee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing lenders with a government-backed guarantee for 75% of the value of each individual loan, subject to a cap set by an Annual Claim Limit, EFG facilitates lending that would otherwise not take place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guarantee provides protection to the lender in the event of default by the borrower – it is not insurance for the borrower in the event of their inability to repay the loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The borrower is responsible for repayment of 100% of the EFG facility, not just the 25% outside the coverage of the government guarantee. Where defaults occur, the lender is obliged to follow their standard commercial recovery procedure, including the realisation of security, before they can make a claim against the government guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the costs and fees charged by the lender, businesses supported under EFG are required to pay an additional 2% annual premium which partially covers the cost of providing the guarantee. The premium is assessed and collected quarterly in advance throughout the life of the loan based on the outstanding capital balance of the loan (for invoice finance and overdraft guarantees the premium is assessed on the agreed facility limit). The borrower is provided with a premium schedule by the lender as part of their loan documentation and collection is made by Direct Debit under the description “BIS LOAN GUARANTEE”. The interest rate charged and any other fees and charges applied to the loan are a commercial matter for the lender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="security--personal-guarantees"&gt;Security / personal guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under EFG, lenders are entitled to take security, including personal guarantees. This is standard commercial practice and an established mechanism for ensuring a degree of personal commitment to repayment of the loan by the business. In EFG this means there is a three-way risk sharing between borrower, lender and the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taking security, lenders are required to apply their normal commercial policies in determining the extent and value of security available. The exception from normal commercial practice is that lenders are expressly prohibited from taking a charge over a principal private residence for an EFG facility. 
A personal guarantee should not be taken or attributed, solely or preferentially to cover the 25% of the EFG loan not covered by the Government guarantee. The borrower is liable for repayment of 100% of the loan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EFG should not be seen by borrowers or their advisers as a mechanism for putting personal assets beyond consideration (principal private residence excluded for the purposes of EFG). If the lender refuses to offer EFG on the basis that the borrower had access to security which they were not prepared to put forward, then the lenders decision would be fully supported by BIS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enterprise-finance-guarantee-further-help"&gt;Enterprise Finance Guarantee: further help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of EFG, including the decision on whether or not it is appropriate to use it in connection with any specific lending transaction, is fully delegated to the participating lenders. &lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121017180846/http:/www.capitalforenterprise.gov.uk/" title="Information about Capital for Enterprise Limited"&gt;Capital for Enterprise Limited&lt;/a&gt; oversees the running of EFG on behalf of BIS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="for-lenders"&gt;For lenders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals within a participating lender should contact their central processing team or other designated internal EFG expert who can obtain further information from CfEL if required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="for-businesses"&gt;For businesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses may wish to consider approaching one or more of the participating lenders to discuss their borrowing needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that have any issues relating to an EFG loan, including premium collection or alterations to their repayment profile, should raise them with their lender and not with BIS or CfEL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that neither BIS nor CfEL will intervene in the commercial relationship between borrower and lender in the event of disputes. Customers dissatisfied with the experience of dealing with their bank should raise their concerns through the bank’s own customer complaints procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
