    <title>Channel Tunnel: transposition of railway safety and interoperability directives</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently seeking views on whether to transpose the requirements of 3 European directives on railway safety and interoperability so that these provisions are in force for the Channel Tunnel. In recognition of the Tunnel’s cross-border nature these we would like to incorporate the provisions of these railway safety and interoperability directives by making amendments to the Channel Tunnel (Safety) Order 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Low carbon bus calculator</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the benefits of purchasing a low carbon bus will be different for each operator and will depend on the way in which the bus in service is used. So, Department for Transport economists have produced a transparent, user-friendly toolkit to be used by bus operators and local authorities to calculate the likely benefits on investing in a low carbon emission bus (&lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;). Your assessment should always compare the &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; to an equivalent diesel bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit allows you flexibility in changing the input assumptions to those most relevant to you. You will be able to assess the financial implications of purchasing a &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt;, based on the fuel savings on offer (as advised by &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;LCEB&lt;/abbr&gt; manufacturers or experienced in trials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreadsheet tool is intended to provide indicative estimates only and &lt;abbr title="low carbon emission bus"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; does not vouch for the accuracy of such estimates. Please note that the Department for Transport does not accept any liability for any decisions that may be taken on the basis of such estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toolkit will be routinely updated and refined. Details of any updates or changes that are made will be outlined in the ‘Intro’ worksheet of the toolkit. We therefore encourage you to visit this website regularly and download the toolkit to ensure you are using the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Removal of motor insurance certificates</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on amending the Road Traffic Act 1988 to remove the need for insurers to issue a motor insurance certificate when an insurance policy is taken out. At present the certificate is used as evidence of valid insurance cover and there are circumstances when it must be produced by the insured to demonstrate they have valid cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurers are required by law to enter details of all motor insurance policies onto the motor insurance database (&lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt;). This consultation document considers using the &lt;abbr title="motor insurance database"&gt;MID&lt;/abbr&gt; as the single source for checking if insurance cover is in place and considers what further changes and developments are needed to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Aviation permits</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-permit-regime-explained"&gt;The permit regime explained&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before operating to, from or within the United Kingdom, all foreign registered aircraft must be in possession of an operating permit issued by the Department for Transport’s International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division (&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt;) under the 2009 Air Navigation Order. This requirement extends to all scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo charters that are not covered by the provisions of the European market access regulations, and to flights carrying out aerial work (e.g. photography, parachuting, flight training). Foreign aircraft require also permits under the appropriate air navigation orders before operating to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and the UK overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before granting any operating permits for scheduled flights, &lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; ensures that the services are operating in conformity with the traffic rights and conditions provided under the UK’s bilateral air services arrangements negotiated with the airlines’ states. In the case of non-scheduled flights we seek reciprocity to ensure that UK airlines are allowed similar opportunities from the respective foreign authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="International Aviation, Safety &amp;amp; Environment Division"&gt;IASE&lt;/abbr&gt; also ensures that a number of administrative arrangements are completed before an operating permit is granted. These require airlines to provide valid certificates that are recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on competency (ie air operators certificate), insurance, registration, aircraft airworthiness and noise and that aircraft are fitted with a recognised enhanced ground proximity warning system, airborne collision avoidance system and crews are aware of the UK Approach Ban requirements and comply with aerodrome operating minima requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, any airline operating aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of 10,000kgs or more in the United Kingdom must also have a security Direction (known as the Single Consolidated Direction (Aviation) 2010) served on them and so applicants applying for a permit that involves such an operation should also contact &lt;a href="mailto:surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;surefaxupdate@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="departmental-contacts"&gt;Departmental contacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to the Secretary of State for airline operating permits should be sent using the appropriate form to the Department for Transport at the address below at least 48 hours in advance of the first flight:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maritime Statistics Directive reporting guidance</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help for shipping lines, their agents and ports to complete statistical returns on maritime freight traffic through ports, as required by the European Commission Maritime Statistics Directive (95/64/EU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules and code lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-submission-methods/"&gt;submission methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120606215114/http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-faqs/"&gt;frequently asked questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-maritime-statistics-directive"&gt;What is the Maritime Statistics Directive?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maritime Statistics Directive is a piece of European Union legislation passed in December 1995 &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;amp;lg=EN&amp;amp;numdoc=31995L0064"&gt;Council Directive 96/64/EC&lt;/a&gt; which requires Member States to supply to the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) information relating to maritime traffic through its’ ports. The UK has been required to report data under the Directive since 1 January 2000. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:141:0029:0047:EN:PDF"&gt;directive was ‘recast’&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, bringing together the original directive and various subsequent amendments in one document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="is-the-provision-of-data-obligatory"&gt;Is the provision of data obligatory?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. The directive requires the government to make collection obligatory in the United Kingdom. The legal powers in the UK are by means of a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2330/contents/made"&gt;statutory instrument&lt;/a&gt; under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. The statutory instrument (number 2330 of 1997) obliges all relevant bodies in the transport industry to provide data to &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; for onward transmission to Eurostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-has-to-provide-the-data"&gt;Who has to provide the data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the statutory instrument requires all relevant transport organisations to provide the data, the detailed data has to be provided by the shipping lines or their agents for freight movements through major UK ports (i.e. those handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum). In addition, port authorities at major ports have to provide quarterly aggregated data to confirm the completeness of the data collected from shipping lines/agents.
At minor ports (those handling less than 1 million tonnes) only annual aggregate figures are required from port authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-are-the-data-collected"&gt;Why are the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collected under the directive are used by the European Commission to assist in policy development at a European level and to monitor the impact of European policy measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the UK government has collected statistics on port traffic in the UK since longer before the Directive came in. These have been used by government, business and the wider public in developing and debating maritime transport policy and in planning operations and new ventures. The effect of the Directive was to change the detail of what was already collected in the UK and introduce much more consistency in European port statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="who-is-responsible-for-ensuring-collection-of-data-in-the-uk"&gt;Who is responsible for ensuring collection of data in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government department with overall responsibility for the data collection is the Department for Transport, (&lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;). It employs a collection agent, BMT Reliability consultants, to carry out the day-to-day operation of the data collection activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="where-can-i-find-the-results-from-the-data-collected"&gt;Where can I find the results from the data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport publishes UK data. Eurostat publishes &lt;a rel="external" href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home"&gt;Europe-wide data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-data-has-to-be-collected-and-how-often"&gt;What data has to be collected and how often?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Directive requires the collection of statistics on freight traffic, vessels and passenger traffic through ports throughout the European Union. The &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; has the means to collect data on vessels and passenger traffic separately, so the system described here relates to the requirements for freight traffic only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data relating to freight traffic is only being collected in detail for UK ports handling more than one million tonnes of freight per annum (‘major ports’). This detailed data includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the reporting port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Lloyds Register Number (or IMO Number) for the vessel (or name, flag and deadweight);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the direction of movement (inwards or outwards);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;port of loading for inwards cargo or unloading for outwards cargo;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for unitised traffic the type of units (container, accompanied trailer, unaccompanied trailer etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whether they are loaded or empty units;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of units and the freight tonnage;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for other traffic, the broad product group and freight tonnage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data has to be provided at least quarterly and is being collected primarily from shipping lines or their agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ‘major’ port authorities (where traffic exceeds one million tonnes per annum) are providing the following information on a ‘retrospective’ quarterly basis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the names of all shipping lines and agents using their port;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the identity of all vessels using their port; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the gross weight and number of units of goods in and out of their port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for other ports, handling less than one million tonnes a year, is being provided only annually in summary form by port authorities. 
For more see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-are-the-data-collected-in-the-uk"&gt;How are the data collected in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These range of options are available by which data providers can supply the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by sending the data automatically via a Port Community System&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by entering the data through web based forms (iSDES)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by submitting ASCII data files in a &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; approved format&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by completing paper forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection agency provide a central database to collect and store the data received by these methods, ready for transmission to &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details see &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-submission-methods/"&gt;submission methods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/ecmsd-rules-and-code-lists/"&gt;administrative rules&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Help notes for the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These help notes are for the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011 (RIR 2011) which apply to all of the United Kingdom including the British half of the Channel Tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These help notes are published by the Department for Transport (DfT) to assist industry and others who are affected by the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011 to fulfil their statutory obligations. They do not cover every circumstance and users should consider seeking further advice from the appropriate safety authority (Office of Rail Regulation, Intergovernmental Commission and Department for Regional Development).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These help notes are produced in line with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills guide to code of practice on guidance which is available at:  &lt;a href="http://www.betterregulation.gov.uk"&gt;www.betterregulation.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader will find that the process-based parts of help notes variously use the two terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“must” and “shall”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“should” or “may”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Must” or “shall” indicates that a statutory duty needs to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Should” or “may” indicates a recommendation to achieve the best outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any comments, queries or suggestions on existing or further help notes, please e-mail &lt;a href="mailto:mailto:interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;interoperability@dft.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Rail interoperability derogations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interoperability regime provides for the possibility of an exemption to be granted to allow a specific project not to comply with particular standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011 provide for derogations to be granted, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, for projects to introduce new, upgraded or renewed subsystems but these are only available in limited circumstances which can be summarised as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projects at an advanced stage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gauge or energy incompatibility issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;network separation or isolation by sea or geography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;economic viability issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accident or natural disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some circumstances, other factors can allow exemptions for upgrade and renewal work, and in all cases, the Secretary of State must notify the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airports Commission</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 7 September 2012, the government announced its intention to create an independent commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, to identify and recommend to government options for maintaining the UK’s status as a global aviation hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission’s role will be to identify and evaluate how any need for additional capacity should be met in the short, medium and long term whilst maintaining a UK-wide perspective. The commission will need to ensure it undertakes a thorough assessment of all the issues by considering all relevant factors including the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits and where necessary, the operational and technical deliverability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission’s website is currently under development. More information will be provided in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local Sustainable Transport Fund</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Transport White Paper Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon, published in January 2011, placed localism at the heart of the transport agenda in order to cut carbon emissions and create local growth. A total of £560 million was originally made available through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund to enable the Department to fund a number of high quality bids. Funding was topped up with a further £40 million to £600 million in 2012 to accommodate approval for a greater number of bids (with match funding being provided by local authority partners). In total, DfT awarded funding to 96 packages to 77 authorities to deliver their schemes between 2011 and 2015. Along with local contributions provided by all funded project teams, over £1 billion is now being invested in local sustainable travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding announcements made were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 September 2012, Ministers approved just under £5 million to Tyne and Wear ITA for a small project, based on the strongest elements of their Large Project proposal (which was turned down for funding in June 2012)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;27 June 2012, Ministers awarded £225 million to 12 large projects (above £5 million), plus £41 million to 14 tranche 2 projects (small projects up to £5 million)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;24 May 2012, Ministers awarded £113 million to 30 tranche 2 projects (small projects up to £5 million)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 July 2011, Ministers awarded £155 million to 39 tranche 1 projects (small projects up to £5 million)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Sustainable Transport Fund bidding rounds are now closed and the fund is fully committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will bring transformational benefits to the UK: major investment; new jobs; regeneration in cities; improved connectivity, faster journeys and freeing up capacity on existing rail lines, which are becoming increasingly congested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such a major project will also have environmental impacts and affect local property markets. The government has already worked hard to minimise the impact of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; on the landscape, protecting the countryside and local communities as far as possible by adding more tunnels and making changes to the proposed route between London and Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current law provides appropriate compensation for the vast majority of infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will be an exceptional construction project - the biggest seen in the UK since Victorian times. Because of the exceptional nature of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; we believe it is right to go above and beyond what is set out in law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is being proposed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six key elements of the government’s proposals to help those affected by &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-1-a-streamlined-advanced-purchase"&gt;Proposal 1: a streamlined advanced purchase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simplifies the compensation process for property owners in &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;’s safeguarded area; this is land that needs to be protected from any other conflicting developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-2-a-voluntary-purchase-scheme"&gt;Proposal 2: a voluntary purchase scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for rural areas where the line is not in deep bored tunnels. Property owners within 120 metres of either side of the line, but outside the safeguarded area, could ask the government to buy their property for its unblighted market value, that is what it would have been worth if there had been no plans for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-3-a-sale-and-rent-back-scheme"&gt;Proposal 3: a sale and rent-back scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would give greater flexibility for the home owners whose properties need to be demolished. They could sell their properties to the government, but remain living in them as tenants until the properties are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-4-a-long-term-hardship-scheme"&gt;Proposal 4: a long term hardship scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would provide cover for properties beyond the voluntary purchase zone. It would help those who have a strong personal need to move but, because of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;, cannot sell their home other than at a significant loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-5-properties-above-tunnels"&gt;Proposal 5: properties above tunnels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide confidence in properties above tunnels the Government will offer before and after surveys and settlement deeds and guarantee forever the rectification costs of any settlement or subsidence issues caused to properties by tunnelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="proposal-6-social-rented-housing"&gt;Proposal 6: Social rented housing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy to replace any social rented housing lost as a result of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s proposals are designed to ensure that property owners and occupiers receive as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
