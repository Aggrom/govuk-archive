    <title>The Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2010: guidelines on the appointment of UK notified bodies to undertake conformity assessment</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Describes the requirements for assessing and appointing notified bodies under the Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2010.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines describe the requirements that apply in the United Kingdom for assessing and appointing notified bodies under the Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1554) (“the 2010 Regulations”). These Regulations implement the provisions of the EC Pyrotechnics Directive (2007/23/EC) in UK law.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notified bodies are appointed under and operate according to the law which transposes the provisions of the directive. The text of the directive was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 23 May 2007 and published in the Official Journal No. L 154/1, on 14 June 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directive applies in the European Economic Area (EEA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Consultation on the repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is seeking views on the possible repeal of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 (PMA). The PMA makes it an offence to make false or misleading statements in the course of an estate agency or property development business about property offered for sale. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) provide similar protections for consumers. This duplication may be unnecessary; putting additional burdens on business, without providing additional protection for consumers. The consultation considers whether the Government should repeal the PMA, now that the CPRs are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Better choices: better deals. Report on progress on the consumer empowerment strategy</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>This report covers the progress that has been made in the 18 months since the consumer empowerment strategy was launched. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer empowerment strategy Better Choices: Better Deals was published in April 2011. This progress report describes how the wide range of commitments made then have been taken forward. Many of these have involved two or more of government, businesses, economic regulators, consumer groups and individual consumers coming together to develop practical ways to help empower people to make better choices and get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empowerment strategy established midata, a programme of work involving government, consumer groups and leading businesses to give consumers more control and access to the data that companies hold about them. The aim of the midata programme is to give consumers access to their transaction data in a way that is electronic, portable and safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Street Trading and Pedlary Laws: A joint consultation on draft regulations to repeal the Pedlars Acts (UK wide) and make changes to the street trading legislation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The UK Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Scottish Government are jointly consulting on proposals to ensure compliance with the requirements of the European Services Directive.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="background-to-consultation"&gt;Background to consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in our &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/s/11-542-street-trading-pedlar-laws-government-response.pdf"&gt;Government Response&lt;/a&gt; to the street trading and pedlary consultation, the Governments interpretation of compliance with the Directive developed in the course of the evaluation of the Directive amongst Member States. The consensus now is that the retail sale of goods is generally a service activity within the scope of the Directive and since pedlars and street traders are engaged in the retail sale of goods it has been concluded that changes are required to both of these regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="purpose-of-consultation"&gt;Purpose of consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the consultation is to ensure that the street trading and pedlary regimes comply fully with the requirements of the Services Directive.   The UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are seeking views from stakeholders in relation to the repeal of the Pedlars Acts and changes to their respective street trading regimes. The Scottish Government is only seeking views in relation to the repeal of the Pedlars Acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="areas-for-consultation"&gt;Areas for consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public views are being sought specifically in the following areas: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeal of the UK wide Pedlars Acts 1871 and 1881.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new, clear and up to date definition of what behaviour constitutes acting as a pedlar for the purposes of the pedlar exemption under the street trading regimes of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes to Schedule 4 to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 to ensure compliance with the Services Directive - (the street trading regime of England and Wales).  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes to the Northern Ireland (Street Trading) Act 2001 to ensure compliance with the Services Directive.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Civil enforcement remedies - consultation on extending the range of remedies available to public enforcers of consumer law</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>The consultation sets out proposals to extend the range of remedies available to enforcers of consumer law.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals would allow remedies aimed at achieving one or more of three outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increased business compliance with the law;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improved redress for consumers affected by the breach; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more confident consumers who are empowered to exercise greater consumer choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation considers whether implementation of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 or introducing new remedies under Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002 would be most appropriate. Part 8 currently allows for court-based Enforcement Orders which can be used to stop a business behaving in a particular way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals in this consultation form part of a proposed wider reform of consumer law, intended to simplify and clarify consumer law to reduce business compliance costs and empower consumers. Implementation of the proposals would require primary legislation, which we propose to do via a proposed Consumer Bill of Rights.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consultation on implementing Directive 2011/7/EU on Combating Late Payment in Commercial Transactions</title>
    <category>Consultation</category>
    <summary>This consultation seeks views on the UK’s implementation of the Late Payment Directive. The Directive covers all debts incurred in commercial transactions. It applies to businesses and public authorities, whether the transactions are within the UK or effected across EU borders.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 20 September 2012 Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon published a consultation on implementing new European Union (EU) legislation to combat the problem of late payment by commercial businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK was one of the first countries to introduce late payment legislation and is already seen as an exemplar across Europe. This consultation is on the recast Directive which will to extend existing laws and practices currently enjoyed by British businesses across the Union, creating a level playing field for UK businesses trading with other businesses and public authorities in all Member States. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main points outlined in the EU Directive are that: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public authorities will be required to pay suppliers within 30 calendar days of receipt of an undisputed invoice (this matches the UK Government’s standard practice for the public sector)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For business to business payments, the period for payment fixed in the contract should not exceed 60 days, unless otherwise expressly agreed and provided such terms are not grossly unfair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It copies current UK practice of a default payment period of 30 days, where terms have not been agreed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a minimum €40 (approximately £31) for compensation (current UK legislation sets three levels of compensation payment according to the value of the payment). Suppliers will not be prevented from seeking to claim additional recovery costs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is already working alongside industry bodies in the UK to encourage more businesses to sign up to the Prompt Payment Code which encourages good practice. Over 1,100 businesses have already signed up to the Code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 19 October 2012. Transposition of the EU late payment directive is due to take place on 16 March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
