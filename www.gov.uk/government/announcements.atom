    <title>The UK's G8 priorities</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The UK's G8 Presidency will be an economic G8 that deals with big issues in the global economy and prioritises trade, tax and transparency.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK takes over the one-year Presidency of the G8 today (1 January) and will hold the annual leaders’ summit in Northern Ireland on 17 and 18 June. As the chair of the G8, the UK has a unique opportunity to lead in shaping the outcomes of the summit and taking concrete action with other G8 countries to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges, including important economic and foreign policy issues of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has announced that he will focus the G8 in 2013 on 3 key areas: open economies, open governments and open societies to unleash the power of the private sector by advancing trade, ensuring tax compliance and promoting greater transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="trade"&gt;Trade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater stimulus for growth in the world economy than trade and no more important battle than the fight against protectionism. The G8 has collective responsibility to drive forward trade liberalisation. Among G8 countries work is already on going to prepare a free trade agreement between the EU and Canada and work will start next year to begin free trade negotiations between the EU and Japan and the EU and US. An EU-US free trade agreement would be particularly significant – the EU and US together make up nearly a third of all global trade and an ambitious deal between the two could provide an enormous boost to jobs and growth. The G8 leaders’ summit will be an opportunity to show the importance of this ongoing work and to agree how to accelerate progress across our common trade priorities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tax"&gt;Tax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK’s G8 Presidency will focus on strengthening international tax standards and working on greater international tax information exchange to tackle tax havens.  This will build on work that is already underway in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and maintain the momentum set by the G20. And we will work with developing countries to enable them to collect tax that is due to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="transparency"&gt;Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G8 has a long history of advancing the development agenda - and the UK’s G8 Presidency will be no different. The UK is meeting its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on aid from 2013 and will hold other countries to account for their promises too. With this track record on aid, the Prime Minister plans to use the G8 Presidency to support the ‘golden thread’ of conditions that he sees as critical to the growth and prosperity of countries across the world. These include the absence of conflict, clamping down on corruption and ensuring strong and accountable government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency and accountability are vitally important to achieve these conditions. Too often, development at the G8 has been about rich countries doing things to poor countries. But at Lough Erne the G8 will focus on getting its own house in order and helping developing countries to prosper in the process. An example of this is mineral wealth. It’s important that developing countries rich in minerals see this as a blessing not a curse. The UK is already leading efforts in the EU that will require oil, gas and mining companies to publish key financial information for each country and project they work on. The UK’s G8 Presidency will push for greater transparency all around the globe so that revenues from oil, gas and mining are transparent. This should encourage greater accountability and ensure money doesn’t fuel conflict and corruption, but instead is used to provide better public services for citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined action on trade, tax and transparency during the UK’s G8 Presidency could lay the foundations of long-term growth and prosperity for generations to come and will support the development of open economies, open governments and open societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s G8 Presidency will also make progress across a range of vital global issues, including foreign policy challenges and supporting Arab Spring countries. The UK’s Presidency will also build on the Olympic Hunger Summit and the US’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, leading the way in the battle against hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this year the UK will also produce a comprehensive accountability report (CAR) that will show progress against key commitments made by the G8. The report is a concrete example of transparency and accountability at work, a central theme of the UK’s G8 Presidency, and an opportunity to hold G8 leaders to account. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lough Erne: G8 venue</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Prime Minister has chosen to hold this year's G8 Summit at Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 the UK will hold the Presidency of the G8. As part of the year-long Presidency there will be a G8 Summit of the 8 global leaders in June. The Prime Minister has chosen to hold this year’s G8 Summit at Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, in Northern Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing the G8 to Lough Erne will showcase to the world a modern Northern Ireland with huge potential for investment and tourism, demonstrating the growing confidence that exists in this part of the UK. It will highlight what Northern Ireland, its people and its businesses have to offer the global community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue of Lough Erne 2013 was also chosen because it creates the right conditions to encourage open and frank discussions between the G8 leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to welcoming my fellow leaders to Lough Erne and to showcase Northern Ireland to the world as a modern and dynamic part of the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Northern Ireland’s transformation over the last 2 decades was made possible by the courage of so many people across sections of the community. Their determination and leadership has inspired the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the G8?</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The G8 is a forum that brings together 8 global leaders to address global issues and tackle the most pressing global challenges.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The G8 (Group of 8) is made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the USA and the UK. The EU is represented by Jose Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, and Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council. The Presidency of the G8 rotates each calendar year and the country holding the G8 Presidency is responsible for hosting and organising the annual summit, with a number of preparatory meetings leading up to it. The summit is an opportunity for G8 leaders to have frank and open discussions about the important global issues of the day. In 2013 it will be the UK’s turn to shape the G8’s approach to these discussions with G8 leaders holding each other to account and agreeing concrete steps to advance growth and prosperity across the world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="history-of-the-g8"&gt;History of the G8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973 the world experienced its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The finance ministers of the USA, UK, France and West Germany met informally to talk about how they could solve the economic problems linked with the oil price shock. In 1974 Japan was invited to the meetings and in 1975 the French President brought these informal discussions to the leaders. He also invited Italy to what was the first G6 in Rambouillet, France. There was no army of political advisers in tow, just the leaders in a relaxed and private setting. This low-key formula was very successful and the leaders agreed to meet annually. A year later Canada joined and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia became a full member in 1998. The EU has been part of the group since 1977, but does not hold a Presidency. Almost 40 years on, the G8 countries can provide guidance and stability in an unpredictable world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-presidency-involve"&gt;What does the Presidency involve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G8 Presidency runs for 1 calendar year and rotates among the 8 member countries. The country chairing the Presidency is responsible for shaping the issues that leaders discuss at the G8 Summit and hosts a number of preparatory meetings leading up to the summit. It also acts as the spokesperson for the G8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Presidency is an opportunity for the UK to influence the international debate on our global priorities, which include tax, trade and transparency. At the end of this year, the UK will hand over the Presidency to Russia for 2014. The Presidency will continue in its rotation to Germany in 2015, Japan in 2016, Italy in 2017, Canada in 2018, France in 2019, and the USA in 2020 before it returns to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-g8-do"&gt;What does the G8 do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G8 is a forum that provides the opportunity for its members to co-operate in addressing global challenges. The standards it sets, commitments it makes and steps it takes aim to drive prosperity and economic growth all over the world. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that this year the G8 will return to its roots, creating the right environment for frank and open discussions to promote growth and address global economic problems. There will be a short declaration aimed at holding G8 leaders to account and ensuring that good intentions become vital actions to advance growth and prosperity across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>During the UK G8 Presidency 2013 there will be events in addition to the leaders' summit.</summary>

&lt;p&gt;On 10 and 11 April 2013, the Foreign Secretary William Hague will host his counterparts from the G8 countries. They will meet for the G8 foreign ministers’ meeting at Lancaster House in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On announcing the meeting, the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to the UK’s G8 Presidency making headway on the serious challenges facing our global community today. Today the Prime Minister explained that by supporting the development of open economies, open governments and open societies we can harness the power of the private sector for everyone’s benefit. Our G8 priorities of advancing trade, ensuring tax compliance and promoting greater transparency can only take place in an environment of political stability and peaceful international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With my G8 foreign minister partners, I look forward to discussing and taking decisions on some of the most pressing foreign and security policy issues that we face. In particular I will be focusing on the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, a personal priority for me during the UK’s G8 Presidency and beyond, and ensuring that the G8’s Deauville Partnership provides the support needed by our partners in the Arab world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g7-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-meeting"&gt;G7 finance ministers’ and Central Bank governors’ meeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 10 to 11 May 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and the Governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King will host a spring meeting of the G7 finance ministers and Central Bank governors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On announcing the meeting, the Chancellor said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to hosting colleagues from the G7 to Britain in the spring. This group remains an important institution and a key forum in which to grapple with the challenges that face the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This meeting will be a significant opportunity for the UK and our partners to take on these challenges and to show leadership in the fight to tackle the ongoing ramifications of the global financial and debt crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g8-leaders-summit"&gt;G8 leaders’ summit&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Action on council tax a helping hand to residents cost of living, says Eric Pickles</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Communities Secretary hailed new rules for 2013 that mean taxpayers can now choose to pay their bill over 12 months rather than 10.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move will lower average band D council tax instalments by an average of £24 per month for 10 months and helps tax payers manage their finances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation passed by the government means that in 2013 council tax payers can now request to pay their bills over a longer period of time, lowering their monthly bills, and so easing the financial burden&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has already &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/third-year-of-council-tax-freeze-announced"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; support for local authorities in England to help them freeze council tax in 2014-15 for a third year and assist in keeping bills down. The government has set aside £450 million as part of the Autumn Statement package to help support local authorities. Taxpayers living in an average band D home in England could save up to £72 compared to a 5% increase, while the cumulative effect of the 3 freezes is potentially worth over £200 to band D residents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils will also be able to publish online the detailed supporting information that until now they have had to supply with council tax bills in hard copies. While residents still have the legal right to request hard-copy documents, the online versions will enable authorities to cut costs, improve efficiencies and help the environment through a decrease in the use of paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are also urging councils to follow the example of utility companies in offering discounts to those customers who pay online or through direct debit facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know many people are worried about their cost of living expenses and we’ve already acted to freeze council tax in the past 2 years after bills doubled under the last administration. We have now offered councils a third freeze deal, which could have a combined effect potentially worth over £200 to band D residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have also changed the rules so hard working council residents can choose to pay their annual bills online or spread their payments over 12 months instead of 10. These sensible measures will make paying easier giving tax payers a little more room for manoeuvre and bring down their monthly outgoings by around £24 for most of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billing authorities collect and enforce council tax as per the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/613/contents/made"&gt;Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/3038/contents/made"&gt;Council Tax (Demand Notices)(England) Regulations 2011&lt;/a&gt;. For each financial year, billing authorities must issue demand notices (the bill) setting out the amount that is due and how it is to be paid. From April 2013, the demand notice will inform bill payers of their right to pay in 12 instalments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government consulted on its technical reforms to council tax between 31 October and 29 December 2011. The government’s response can be found on the 
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/technical-reforms-of-council-tax"&gt;consultation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has set aside £450 million over two years as part of the Autumn Statement package to help support local authorities in freezing their council tax in 2013-14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>FCO Minister for Africa comments on vote agreeing sanctions against groups and individuals involved in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Simmonds MP, the UK Minister for Africa, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome today’s agreement by the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee to add the Congolese rebel group, M23, to its list of sanctioned organisations and individuals. The Committee also agreed the listings of two M23 leaders, Eric Badege and Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, as well as of the militia group Forces Democratiques de Libération du Rwanda (FDLR). The UK supports these measures as part of the international community’s response to the crisis in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We remain committed to finding long term solutions which will end the cycle of violence in the DRC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The dialogue needed to resolve the crisis must ensure that all violence stops, that external support to M23 ends and that there is no impunity for M23 commanders and others who have committed serious human rights abuses, including the FDLR. It is also important that the DRC Government shows leadership in addressing the underlying causes of conflict in the East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK, with its partners, will continue to seek ways to support the building of a sustainable peace in eastern DRC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Make it your New Year’s resolution to help get rough sleepers off the streets</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>People setting their New Year’s resolutions can now pledge to offer practical help to rough sleepers in 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Mark Prisk urged anyone wanting to get help for someone sleeping rough to use the new StreetLink hotline and website to ensure they are put in touch with the local agencies offering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He argued that while people want to offer help to those facing homelessness, they often don’t know where to turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But StreetLink, run by charities Homeless Link and Broadway with support from Government, offers a “valuable alternative” to a cash handout for people sleeping rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-second-night-out"&gt;No Second Night Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those looking to offer help can call 0300 500 0914 or go to &lt;a href="www.streetlink.org.uk"&gt;www.streetlink.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; to put those facing sleeping rough in touch with local charities and councils who can them get them long-term support and safe accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister argued this new and innovative service helps support the No Second Night Out initiative as it is extended across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In London, where No Second Night Out has been adopted, 70% of rough sleepers have not spent more than one night on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Prisk said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The New Year offers many of us an opportunity to make a new start -  StreetLink offers that opportunity to those facing the prospect of living on our streets and a valuable alternative to simply a cash handout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would urge anyone looking to set themselves a New Year’s resolution to use this service to ensure people sleeping rough in their area get the support they need to get off the streets and into a stable home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZBIXCl1UwE"&gt;Mark Prisk on rough sleeping and Streetlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Driving this New Year's Eve? Try a mocktail</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Department for Transport has produced a number of non-alcoholic cocktail recipes to help designated drivers celebrate in style.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is encouraging drivers to opt for non alcoholic ‘mocktails’ in a bid to cut down on drink driving this New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has produced a number of recipes – from a Berry Breezer to a Piña Banana – to appeal to those who are designated drivers on nights out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department is also warning party-goers to plan their way home in advance so they can celebrate the New Year in style, not in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting television advert highlighting the consequences of drink driving has been shown throughout December as part of the Department for Transport’s THINK! drink drive campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our message is clear: have a great New Year’s Eve, don’t risk the consequences of drink driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you get behind the wheel after drinking you risk losing your licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2011, 280 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. Do not let 1 selfish and foolish decision ruin your or another family’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, drivers aged between 20 and 24 failed more breath tests than any other age group. This year’s THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign is aimed at young people who are shown to be consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures. THINK! advises planning your journey home well in advance and treating your designated driver to a non-alcoholic Christmas cocktail. The recipes are easy to make at home and provide a festive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is currently consulting on a package of tough measures to crack down on drink drivers. This includes removing drink drivers’ rights to demand a blood or urine test. This is because evidence shows it is used as a delaying tactic by drivers caught over the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department has also supported Coke’s designated driver scheme, which offered buy 1 get 1 free soft drinks in pubs around the country throughout December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACPO lead for roads policing, Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Millions of people will be heading out for New Year’s Eve celebrations and we would ask the public to play their part in remaining safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have seen hundreds of people die from drink driving this year and it has to stop. Innocent people are needlessly dying on our roads and people who make the decision to drive after taking alcohol or drugs are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are someone who drinks and drives, by making a decision to stop in 2013 could save someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is provisionally estimated that 2011 saw 280 deaths, 1,290 serious injuries and 9,990 total casualties directly related to drink driving incidents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign budget totals £783,925&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Army's airborne engineers build French connection</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>An exercise has seen British airborne engineers build a bridge over a large man-made lake and train with their French counterparts.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/royalengineers/role/834.aspx" title="23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault)"&gt;23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault)&lt;/a&gt; has been working in the harsh climate and unforgiving landscape of Northumbria with French troops from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/presentation/organisation-des-forces/genie/17e-regiment-du-genie-parachutiste" title="17e Regiment du Genie Parachutiste"&gt;17e Regiment du Genie Parachutiste&lt;/a&gt; (17e RGP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise Eagle Sapper tested troops in a humanitarian relief operation in a country facing famine and struggling to recover from damage caused by a tsunami, with government control undermined by insurgents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deploying from their base at Woodbridge in Suffolk, the exercise started in earnest with the use of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/royalengineers/equipment/705.aspx" title="Air Portable Ferry Bridge"&gt;Air Portable Ferry Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (APFB) equipment to move vehicles and personnel across the two-mile-wide (3.2km) expanse of Kielder Water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APFB specialist equipment is designed to be parachuted or moved by helicopter and set up either as a conventional bridge or a self-propelled ferry to cross wider obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sappers preparing the bridge" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1134/16x-2012-115-0114.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sappers preparing the bridge to go over Kielder Water during Exercise Eagle Sapper [Picture: Corporal Obi Igbo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sappers then moved to Otterburn, where they were challenged to build water supply points capable of providing 40,000 litres of drinking water every day, cross rivers using bridging equipment and improvised materials, demolish obstacles, and construct defensive positions which were then attacked by enemy forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training was intended to test the unit in their role providing combat engineering support to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/12409.aspx" title="16 Air Assault Brigade"&gt;16 Air Assault Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, which is ready to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice for operations ranging from disaster relief to war-fighting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Colonel Jason Hones, Commanding Officer of 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault), said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Exercise Eagle Sapper has seen our soldiers working for up to 22-hours-a-day on demanding tasks that test both their combat engineering and infantry skills in very harsh terrain and weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Water supply point" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1135/16x-2012-115-0631.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is important that we test the mettle of the soldier we are going to send on operations in arduous and unknown conditions so that we know he can cope with anything that is thrown at him. If a soldier can survive in Northumbria in winter he can survive anywhere in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French troops joined the exercise as part of the developing partnership between 16 Air Assault Brigade and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/presentation/organisation-des-forces/brigades/11e-brigade-parachutiste" title="11e Brigade Parachutiste"&gt;11e Brigade Parachutiste&lt;/a&gt; (11e BP), which have been tasked to develop a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for contingency operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lt Col Hones said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re really lucky to have soldiers from our French partner regiment with us, having recently sent troops over to train in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Water supply point" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1136/16x-2012-115-0667.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A water supply point constructed during Exercise Eagle Sapper on Otterburn Ranges [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working together on this exercise is developing our integration at the section level, to learn how we each operate and our particular strengths and weaknesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will take this to the next level up in the coming months, working towards the aim of being able to work seamlessly together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Matthieu Le Puloc’h commanded the ten-strong 17e RGP contingent, who lived and worked with their British counterparts throughout the two-week exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is our first joint training and our presence is about learning how 23 Engineer Regiment works so that, if we do go on operations together, we know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A sapper from 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault) defends his position" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1137/16x-2012-115-0804.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of similarities in our basic role as airborne engineers, but our equipment and working practices are different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Otterburn is a cold and hard environment but we have quickly adapted to it and the exercise has been a great experience to broaden the minds of our soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Steve McCann said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s been a tough exercise in difficult conditions that has been made more challenging by working with our French counterparts. Their kit is slightly different and the language barrier makes everything go a little bit slower, but we’re showing them how we work and it’s rewarding to complete engineering tasks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Military urge generous public not to swamp postal system at Christmas</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Service personnel are urging members of the public to avoid sending unsolicited Christmas gifts and packages to operational theatres.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Christmas post deadline of 3 December approaches for Armed Forces personnel serving overseas, servicemen and women are urging members of the public not to send unsolicited gifts and packages to operational theatres such as Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these kind sentiments are appreciated, such generosity has often resulted in delaying important mail from family and friends reaching their destination at this special time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceFor/ServiceCommunity/BFPO/BritishForcesPostOffice.htm" title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;British Forces Post Office&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;) is overwhelmed by the generosity of the public who send individuals, and groups, in operational theatres boxes of treats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although well-intentioned, the message is very clear: if people wish to show their support for those serving in Afghanistan, there are far more effective ways of doing so such as donations to Service charities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafbrizenorton/" title="RAF Brize Norton"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt; spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Brett Duxbury said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As with every year, the Christmas post period is by far our busiest. Just this week we dispatched more than 10,500 bags of mail to operational theatres, which will arrive in time for Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unsolicited mail can seriously impact on our ability to deliver post from loved ones to personnel serving on operations at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We do not underestimate the impact that mail from friends and family can have on morale and it is for that reason we make it our priority each year to ensure it arrives on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parcels are coming in thick and fast to the military’s premier transport hub of &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton, via the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, and have been loaded onto aircraft ready for dispatch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Service personnel are working hard to ensure that this mail is delivered alongside other vital supplies such as helicopters, armoured vehicles and lifesaving equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Danny Smith, from No 1 Air Mobility Wing at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the last two days over 23 tonnes of mail has arrived at Brize Norton from the &lt;abbr title="British Forces Post Office"&gt;BFPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, which has been loaded onto aircraft and is now en route to various operational theatres including Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a challenging but important task ensuring it is all dispatched quickly. Having served in Afghanistan at Christmas last year, I understand how much value our boys and girls place on receiving post from people closest to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Christmas mail for the troops" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1242/Mail1g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Christmas mail for the troops, sorted, bagged and packaged, awaits final transportation to Afghanistan in the air cargo hangar at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton [Picture: Steve Lympany, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of mail arriving at Camp Bastion for onward distribution to other locations in Afghanistan can cause other problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onward delivery of goodwill parcels to forward operating bases necessitates additional resupply flights and convoys, which places Service personnel at additional risk in what is already a difficult and dangerous operating environment. Every time an additional convoy is laid on, more troops are put at risk of enemy attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of items included in many welfare parcels are either already readily available in theatre or are simply not appropriate for the Afghan environment. Not only does this mean that the items go to waste, but time and resources have to be diverted from crucial operations to organise their disposal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, Mark Francois, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Government is dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces, particularly those deployed on operations. This is reflected in the Deployed Welfare Package, a key part of which is the safe and timely delivery of free personal mail from family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past this mechanism has been used by the general public to show their support and resulted in huge volumes of unsolicited goodwill parcels being sent, which have overwhelmed the in-theatre postal and logistics capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst unsolicited mail is well-intentioned, mail sent by families and friends is the most important to deployed personnel and is our absolute priority. Moreover, unsolicited mail strains the logistics supply and prevents mail from families getting through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For this reason the MOD will be repeating its unsolicited mail campaign. Rather than sending their own letter or parcel, I would encourage people to make a donation to one of Britain’s excellent Service charities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They might also consider &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.uk4u.org/" title="uk4u Thanks!"&gt;‘uk4u Thanks!’&lt;/a&gt; - a charity that provides Christmas gifts to deployed Service personnel. Once again I would like to say thank you to the British public, on behalf of the MOD and Armed Forces, for their incredible support of our serving personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Christmas mail for the troops" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1243/Mail2g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mail for troops in places such as Afghanistan awaiting loading onto aircraft at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Brize Norton [Picture: Steve Lympany, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the charity uk4u Thanks! will, for the ninth year, deliver a Christmas Box of practical gifts and treats to every soldier, sailor and airman deployed overseas - in Afghanistan and elsewhere - and to those in hospital and recovery centres in time for 25 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its parcels are delivered via the supply chain, meaning there is no impact on the mail network. Although the charity benefits from corporate sponsorship, it also needs donations from the public to continue its work bringing Christmas cheer to thousands of personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the MOD provides a comprehensive Deployed Welfare Package which includes a free mail service for families and friends, 30 minutes of telephone calls a week and internet access, there are still areas where life in an operational theatre can be improved over and above that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, and in order to enable members of the public to make a contribution to the welfare of personnel in an appropriate way, the MOD Operations Welfare Fund was established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priority for spending from the fund is set by commanders in theatre for those items which have the most impact on enhancing the morale of their personnel, and any money donated to this fund enables commanding officers on the ground to bid for items which their men and women have asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of items purchased through the fund are Wii handsets, portable DVD players, games and table tennis tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone wishing to make a donation can send a cheque to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations Welfare Fund, J1 Operation HERRICK, PJHQ, Sandy Lane, Northwood, Middlesex HA6 3HP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last recommended Christmas posting date for personnel on Her Majesty’s ships is Friday 30 November 2012, and for Operation HERRICK and Operation KIPION is Monday 3 December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Historic Signing Marks Victory for 15 (North East) Brigade</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The UK’s largest regional brigade is the first to sign up every local authority in its area to the new Armed Forces Community Covenant.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;15 (North East) Brigade joined Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council and its partners for the grand finale this week at the historic signing – just a week after thousands of people lined the town’s streets to welcome home the Light Dragoons from their tour in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Signing the covenant" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1210/signingup.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Moreno.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brigadier Greville Bibby, Commander of 15 (North East) Brigade, added his signature to that of Barnsley council leader Stephen Houghton; Commander David Pickthall, Chief of Staff, Naval Regional Commander for Northern England, and RAF Squadron Leader Phil Todd, of Recruiting North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="signing-ceremony"&gt;Signing ceremony&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the signing ceremony in the town hall’s council chamber, Brig Bibby, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The signing of an Armed Forces Community Covenant by the people of Barnsley is the final ceremony that sees all local authorities in my brigade area – representing a population of 7.8 million – pledge their support for their Armed Forces’ communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Brigadier Greville Bibby." src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1211/Brigadier_Bibby.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This achievement, along with the recent signing of the North East Armed Forces Community Charter by the Association of North East Councils, means that the people of Yorkshire, the Humber and the North East are leading the way with their support for the Armed Forces Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id="forces-friendly"&gt;Forces friendly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brig Bibby added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barnsley has always been a Forces-friendly town, with the local community supporting military personnel both past and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The covenant will help cement that support at a local level and ensure that our Armed Forces, veterans and their families have the assistance they need and are treated with the dignity they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cllr Steve Houghton, Barnsley council leader, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barnsley is delighted to add its signature to those of a growing number of local authorities across the county. The people of Barnsley have always been extremely grateful and proud of those men and women working in the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our signing of the Armed Forces Community Covenant is an opportunity for us to recognise, formally, our ongoing commitment to support those involved with and leaving the Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces Community Covenant was drawn up in May 2011. It is aimed at building closer ties between military families and the local community within the 11 regional brigades that span the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then just over half of the 430 local authorities that are eligible to sign have made that commitment, with 15 (North East) Brigade – the largest regional brigade in the UK - being the first to get all local authorities within its area to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>General Norman Schwarzkopf tribute </title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The UK Chief of the Defence Staff has paid tribute to the retired US General Norman Schwarzkopf, who died yesterday, 27 December 2012, aged 78.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Schwarzkopf was commander of coalition forces in the first Gulf War from 1990-91.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the Defence Staff, &lt;a href="/government/people/david-richards" title="General Sir David Richards"&gt;General Sir David Richards&lt;/a&gt;, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Norman Schwarzkopf’s command in the Gulf was an example of the finest qualities of American leadership: decisive, inclusive and measured. At the head of a coalition of forces from around the world, including many from the region, he played a pivotal role in the liberation of Kuwait. The operation was not only a UN act but marked the transition from a Cold War doctrine of dissuasion and balance to a new world where force could be used for good. As its first practitioner General Schwarzkopf accomplished what so few can: he shaped his times. He was the first of what are now many US generals to lead British forces in this kind of conflict, rather than in Cold War stasis of the previous decades. For that, and his inspirational command in war, he will be remembered on this side of the Atlantic with respect. The Anglo-American alliance has gone from strength to strength since his time, but it started with him. My thoughts are with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Illustrious visits Malta</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>HMS Illustrious has arrived at the Mediterranean island of Malta for a five-day visit.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,500 sailors and marines lined the deck of the Portsmouth-based helicopter carrier as she entered the port of Valletta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as an onboard reception for the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the ship will be holding an affiliation event for representatives from the Maltese cities of Senglea, Vittoriosa and L’Isla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The helicopter carrier is twinned with the three cities due to a previous HMS Illustrious which was bombed during the Second World War and underwent extensive repair at the Grand Harbour in Malta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Martin Connell, Commanding Officer of HMS Illustrious, said it was a proud moment for him to be sailing HMS Illustrious into Valletta. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are very much aware of not just the history of this ship but also the previous Illustrious and what the people of Malta did to help save her in 1941.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sailors line the deck of HMS Illustrious" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1157/IL120467045.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sailors line the deck of HMS Illustrious as she enters the port of Valletta [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Ray Jones, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.gov.mt/" title="Government of Malta"&gt;Maltese Government&lt;/a&gt; also allowed the Grand Harbour in Valletta to be used for berthing by HMS Cumberland and HMS York following their evacuation of British nationals from Libya in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time in Grand Harbour, sailors and marines from HMS Illustrious will be helping out with a variety of worthy causes including a clean-up of outdoor spaces in collaboration with the Nature Trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the week &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Assault-Ships/HMS-Illustrious" title="HMS Illustrious"&gt;HMS Illustrious&lt;/a&gt; will be joined by the Royal Navy fleet flagship, HMS Bulwark, and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Mounts Bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMS Illustrious is part of the Cougar 12 deployment - a three-month work-up of the Royal Navy’s Response Force Task Group (RFTG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="HMS Illustrious enters Malta's Grand Harbour" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1158/IL120467008.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HMS Illustrious enters Malta's Grand Harbour [Picture: Petty Officer (Photographer) Ray Jones, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deployment is a test of the RFTG’s capability should it be called into action at short notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force is designed to respond to rapidly unfolding world events - the last time being Libya in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Cougar 12, the ships have been working with Royal Marines commando units and the Fleet Air Arm to put their amphibious capability to the test - the power to transfer marines from ships onto the beaches of hostile nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as exercising the 3,000 British sailors, marines and airmen, the task force has worked alongside French and Albanian forces to ensure the nations could co-operate on a military level in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>RAF personnel attend funeral of Sir Rex Hunt</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>Royal Air Force personnel have attended the funeral of Sir Rex Hunt, former Governor of the Falkland Islands.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personnel from &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafleeming/aboutus/34squadron.cfm" title="34 Squadron RAF Regiment"&gt;34 Squadron &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafleeming/aboutus/609squadron.cfm" title="609 (West Riding) Squadron"&gt;No 609 (West Riding) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="Royal Auxiliary Air Force"&gt;RAuxAF&lt;/abbr&gt;) have attended the funeral of Sir Rex Hunt, former Governor of the Falkland Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others attending included Air Commodore (Ret’d) Dempster Anderson representing &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment veterans and Group Captain Gary Bunkell, Inspector &lt;abbr title="Royal Auxiliary Air Force"&gt;RAuxAF&lt;/abbr&gt;, representing the Honorary Inspector General.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment formed part of the coffin-bearing party and assisted both in the church and at the graveside. Falklands veterans, ex-&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/The-Royal-Marines" title="Royal Marines"&gt;Royal Marines&lt;/a&gt; and members of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/23304.aspx" title="The Parachute Regiment"&gt;Parachute Regiment&lt;/a&gt; donned their green and maroon berets to form a guard of honour for the coffin as it entered the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffin left the church to the tune of the &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; March and Sir Rex was buried with the Falkland Islands flag on his coffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Jeff Metcalfe, Officer Commanding No 609 (West Riding) Squadron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafleeming/aboutus/2fphome.cfm%202%20Force%20Protection%20Wing%20Headquarters"&gt;No 2 Force Protection Wing&lt;/a&gt; were honoured to be asked to perform this solemn duty for Sir Rex Hunt and his family. The personnel were drawn from 34 Squadron &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment and 609 Squadron &lt;abbr title="Royal Auxiliary Air Force"&gt;RAuxAF&lt;/abbr&gt; and were proud to support this sad occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I served on 2729 Squadron 20 years ago when Sir Rex was my Honorary Air Commodore. I had met him personally and I am proud that I have been involved in laying him to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; personnel in formation at the church where Sir Rex Hunt was laid to rest [Picture: Ian McIntyre, gazettelive.co.uk, 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many within the &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment, still serving or associated with the Corps, who remember Sir Rex with some affection from the earliest days of the Falklands conflict in 1982 when &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafregiment/squadrons/63_sqn_history.cfm" title="63   Squadron RAF Regiment"&gt;63 Squadron &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment&lt;/a&gt; deployed with 5 Brigade and manned the Rapier air defence systems around San Carlos Water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within days of the Argentinean surrender, 63 Squadron &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment redeployed from there to defend the new air base established at &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Stanley, which was to be their home - and for those of the other &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Germany-based Rapier roulement squadrons involved - for another five years before the resident Rapier squadrons redeployed to the new Mount Pleasant Airbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at Stanley, Sir Rex visited the remote Rapier site on many an occasion and he always took an intense interest in the men and what they were doing in defence of the Islands. The &lt;abbr title="Royal Air Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/abbr&gt; Regiment was to be deployed permanently in the Falklands until 2006, a total of 24 unbroken years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the news of the death of Sir Rex Hunt, Foreign Secretary William Hague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was very sorry to hear of the death of Sir Rex Hunt. As Governor of the Falkland Islands he served his country and the Falkland Islanders with great distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surviving Sandy</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary>The Defence Attache in Washington, Major General Buster Howes, recalls his role in helping to manage the crisis that was Hurricane Sandy.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy continues to affect the US East Coast, Major General Howes, the British Defence Attache in the USA and one of the Embassy’s designated crisis managers, described his role as the situation unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Sandy didn’t exactly take the US by surprise as for several days the US media were warning of a storm of biblical proportions shunting its way in from the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This provoked a practical response from many - boarding up windows and evacuating homes along the coastal regions, but in places like Washington DC it generated a subdued sense of apprehension and expectation. The streets were empty and people braced themselves for ‘The Storm of a Lifetime’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Howes explained that the Embassy prepares for a range of civil emergencies, including natural disasters, with the specific aim of being able to assist British nationals who may be affected by such events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assistance focuses on passing information between the US and the UK and particularly helping to locate people in difficulties; assisting with travel arrangements when they have been disrupted as well as accommodation problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about eight million British visitors to the US each year, so there is a high probability that British nationals will be caught up in such events, much as they were when the World Trade Centre was attacked on 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of the hurricane, the Embassy was due to run a crisis exercise, involving teams in London, DC and New York, to further develop procedures and staff competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major General Buster Howes" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1128/busterhowes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major General Buster Howes [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Dean Nixon, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Howes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We chose New York for a whole raft of technical reasons. We were due to do the final planning conference on the Monday, to test all the systems on Tuesday, and run it on the Wednesday - just at the time when Sandy struck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sandy approached, the British Embassy in Washington and the consulates in New York and Boston began contingency planning for a hurricane and prepared for a possible crisis. A strong storm hit DC, but minimal damage actually resulted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the coastal areas around New York were devastated, inundated by a powerful, storm-driven tidal surge which was compounded by the full moon state and spring tides. Federal buildings were shut down for two days in DC as a precautionary measure, which also affected the Embassy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving in metropolitan DC is pretty ‘wild’ at the best of times so this measure was designed to relieve traffic congestion in potentially bad conditions which would have compounded the risk of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the dramatic media reporting, there was a general run on supermarkets for food and batteries and lanterns, since electrical supplies are often compromised by storm damage, as well as petrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing the mood, Major General Howes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clearly the vast majority of people aren’t British but within the Embassy there was a sense of calm expectation. We have a good system for passing information amongst Embassy staff which we obviously utilised, so between that and the television our people remained well informed throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Log jam on the Potomac River" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1129/sandy03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A log jam on the Potomac River next to the Tidal Basin [Picture: Glyn Lowe Photoworks]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dismissed any notion of hysteria saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was pretty understated with considerable humour. We were all stuck at home so, as the responsibility to help manage some of the consequences of the hurricane developed, people were networked at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being holed up in a crisis centre, General Howes worked from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One consequence was that his personal hotmail account crashed at one stage under the weight of e-mails. Asked if he worked closely with the consular office, General Howes described a ‘battle rhythm’ punctuated with daily early morning and late night calls to London, regular sit-reps and daily telephone conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, the media focus switched to New York as it became clear that the worst devastation had affected Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and the whole eastern seaboard of the US leaving 2.5 million homes and businesses crippled by surging seawater and loss of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 140 Defence Staff work in the British Embassy, underpinned by a team of support staff stretching across 34 of the 50 states. General Howes is based in the British Embassy, although he travels widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He praised the way that military and civilians pulled together, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We weren’t acting in a military way, though the expertise, experience and brain power involved military people. That said, the ‘crisis’ meant that people were isolated so the whole Embassy didn’t spin into action the way it would for a more extensive crisis affecting British nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Flood barriers up at Washington Harbour" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1130/sandy04.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Flood barriers up at Washington Harbour [Picture: Glyn Lowe Photoworks]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, if there was a terrorist attack in Massachussetts, the Embassy would swing into crisis mode, everyone would coalesce, and more people would get swept into the operation. However, because we were all at home until Wednesday morning, fewer people were engaged but there were still military people involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if there was a sense of detachment given that the focus was in New York, General Howes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, we just happen to be in DC because it’s the capital but if there’s a problem in America, the Embassy has a lead in helping to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fact that the storm impact was on and around New York made gaining situational awareness in DC a bit harder and our job was to support people struggling with the impact there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 50,000 Brits thought to be staying in New York, General Howes explained that the crisis team provided consular care to British nationals as necessary and kept London informed of developments, issuing emergency travel papers and providing assistance to 57 British nationals who contacted the New York Consulate looking for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This included supporting 25 schoolchildren whose flight was cancelled and helping 20 British nationals who fled without their luggage following their evacuation from the Salisbury Hotel adjacent to a dangling crane on West 57th Street:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We didn’t send people into the field in such uncertain and potentially hazardous circumstances. They anyway would have struggled to get where they wanted to go, but if people called in to say ‘hey, I need help, I’m British’, we were in a position to advise, direct and assist where we could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hurricane Sandy rages over Manhattan" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1131/sandy02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Hurricane Sandy rages over Manhattan [Picture: Michael Cairns]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked for his abiding memory of Sandy, General Howes explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well - from DC’s perspective - if you imagine a very powerful storm with 60mph [97km/h] winds and torrential rain for two days, that’s what it felt like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Howes added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think the abiding memory is thinking how fortunate we were here and how powerful nature is when it gets angry. It was also slightly surreal watching the drama playing out around New York on TV at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is absolutely not a story of personal drama. It’s important to reinforce the fact that the story wasn’t in DC. In a modest way, we helped manage the unfolding mayhem as it affected UK nationals in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our ability to influence what was happening in Delaware, New Jersey and Ocean City was non-existent, but through the TV images we had a profound sense of ‘There but for the grace of God go we’.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Press Release: Graduate apprenticeships for the professions introduced</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduate and post-graduate level apprenticeships will soon be available in subjects including law, accountancy and advanced engineering, Skills Minister Matthew Hancock announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From next year, changes to the Specification of Apprentices Standards for England (SASE) will mean that level six and seven apprenticeships – equivalent to bachelors and masters degree level – are available for the first time, making vocational learning an attractive alternative to the traditional higher education route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already a number of these top-level schemes in development, including in accountancy, law and human resources. BPP Law School is looking to develop a Legal Apprenticeship pathway which could be an alternative route to the legal profession and qualification as a solicitor. It is in discussion with the relevant regulatory body and sector skills council, Skills for Justice, to progress its proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past, apprenticeships were restricted to only some trades, and some parts of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now we are introducing apprenticeships in all types of jobs, including a new route to the professions, to ensure everyone can reach their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These new apprenticeships will help more young people to receive on-the-job training at top companies like BPP Law School, ensuring a vocational route to success in accounting, insurance, and the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director of BPP Professional Apprenticeships James Hammill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are committed to improving social mobility and diversity in the work place by opening up some of the most prestigious professions and employers to school leavers as an alternative to the traditional route. Apprenticeships are an excellent way for employers to recruit talent early and design a structured training programme that incorporates technical learning as well as invaluable work based skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BPP Law School is based in eight UK cities: Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Swindon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
