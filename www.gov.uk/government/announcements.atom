    <title>Revisions to the levels of funding required by goods and public service vehicle licence holders</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport has given notice of revisions to the levels of funding required by holders of goods and public service vehicle operators’ licences operating for hire or reward. This is a requirement of EU Regulation 1071/2009 which affects holders of standard national and standard international licences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Traffic Commissioners retain their discretion to set the financial standing levels for restricted licence holders (not covered by the regulation) and they propose to maintain the current rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised figures are set out below and are based on the euro exchange rate on the first working day in October 2012 – as prescribed by EU Regulation 1071/2009. The new rates will come into force on 1 January 2013 and will remain in place until the 31 December 2013 (previous rates are in brackets). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Minimum financial level requirement&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Standard national and standard international licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£7,200 (£7,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£4,000, ( £4,200)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Restricted licences&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a. first vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£3,100 ( £3,100)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;b. each additional vehicle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;£1,700 ( £1,700)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits set by EU Regulation 1071/2009 are 9000 euros for the first vehicle and 5000 euros for each subsequent vehicle. For member states not participating in monetary union, the regulation requires the equivalent in their currencies to be revised every year, using the euro exchange rate published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the first working day of October in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>No hidden costs to home improvement</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government today announced that anyone looking to improve their home through measures such as building a conservatory will not be subject to any rules requiring them to carry out additional building works on other parts of the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals for ‘consequential improvements’ - whereby work on one part of a home would trigger a requirement to carry out energy efficiency improvement works throughout, such as the installation of loft or cavity wall insulation - would in fact deter many people from having any work done in the first place, ministers believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having consulted carefully, the government has noted the potential danger that introducing consequential improvements would, in fact, discourage people from undertaking home improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This measure ensures that it will remain straightforward for hard-working homeowners to undertake small-scale home improvements and conservatories.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January this year the Department for Communities and Local Government published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-conservation-of-fuel-and-power"&gt;consultation paper&lt;/a&gt; on reforms to building regulations in England, aimed at providing significant savings to business, whilst ensuring buildings remain safe and sustainable. The consultation asked for views on whether to require ‘consequential improvements’ to the energy efficiency of a home when other building work such as the creation of extensions, large conservatories, loft and garage conversions was undertaken, or when boilers or a number of the home’s windows were replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most conservatories would not have been affected by such proposals ministers have carefully considered responses to the consultation, as well as research of the effects on homeowners and building professionals by the Energy Saving Trust and AECOM respectively. The Energy Saving Trust research indicated that over a third of households would be put off from doing home improvements if they had to undertake consequential improvements as well. The research also revealed concerns that there was greater potential for cowboy builders to mislead customers over what consequential improvements would be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the government’s growth agenda and the proposed lifting of planning rules to make it easier for people to carry out sensible extensions and improvements to their home Ministers have decided it would be inappropriate to place an additional cost on building owners. The Green Deal will continue to provide financial incentives to homeowners looking to improve their home’s energy efficiency, cut carbon emissions and reduce their long term energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government confirms settlement of Al Saadi case</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libyan national Sami Al Sa’adi and his family members brought a civil claim against Her Majesty’s Government and named defendants relating to alleged rendition to Libya in 2004 and subsequent mistreatment in detention there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to this claim, a Government spokesperson said today: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can confirm that the Government and the other defendants have reached a settlement with the claimants. There has been no admission of liability and no finding by any court of liability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Launch of new single government website</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beta website includes a new ‘INSIDE GOVERNMENT’ section containing trial MOD corporate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time GOV.UK will eventually replace many of the separate departmental sites run by government organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine government departments are taking part in the first phase of GOV.UK’s launch: the MOD, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Health, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New MOD corporate content has been redeveloped into a framework designed to make government information more accessible and usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A concurrent six-week live test will run from 29 February - 11 April, including a review of the new shared publishing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating departments will keep adding to the site over the six-week trial period at the end of which there will be a pause and an evaluation of feedback received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2012, the MOD website will continue to be the official source of defence-related information until a transition date has been agreed. There will then be a period of time when organisations will run both old and new sites in parallel whilst a final date for closure of the old sites is agreed with the Cabinet Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, GOV.UK will eventually replace many of the separate departmental sites run by government organisations, simplifying things for users and saving millions of pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizen-facing section of GOV.UK was launched on 31 January 2012 and aims to serve the needs of the mainstream majority better by speeding up and facilitating essential transactions such as registering a birth or renewing car tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its target is to replace both Directgov and Business Link in 2012, reducing costs to the public purse, improving the user’s experience, and making all government information easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government part of the site is about meeting the needs of the engaged minority who, like the MOD audience, visit frequently and are likely to spend longer on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New features and interactive opportunities will make life much easier for those frequent users of government websites, focusing on their needs far more than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to the new GOV.UK site will be located on the MOD internet and intranet sites for users to find parallel content easily and quickly. More links will be placed as new content is published and available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Millies heroes honoured at awards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="support-to-the-armed-forces-award"&gt;Support to the Armed Forces Award&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army widow Nikki Scott won the Support to the Armed Forces Award for her charity &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.scottyslittlesoldiers.co.uk/" title="Scotty's Little Soldiers"&gt;Scotty’s Little Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. The charity supports the children of men and women killed while serving in the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikki set up the charity in August 2010 after her husband, Corporal Lee Scott, was killed in Afghanistan in July 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scotty’s Little Soldiers aims to help as many children as possible up to the age of 18 by funding days out and paying for birthday and Christmas presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikki said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Winning this is overwhelming but I’m very proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Oliver handed Nikki her award and hailed her ‘wonderful spirit’. He said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a sacrifice beyond most people made not just by one family but by many families. As a dad of four, it’s probably the hardest award I’ve ever given. You can’t change what’s happened but what Nikki has done is really important. I’m so impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Prime Minister and his wife with members of 3rd Battalion The Rifles" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5432/PMand3rifles.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Prime Minister and his wife with members of 3rd Battalion The Rifles and their Best Unit Award [Picture: The Sun newspaper]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praising the Millies, the TV chef said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s completely integral to pay our respects to the people that have done extraordinary things in extraordinary circumstances. There is not a job like it; we expect a lot and it’s really important that we give these guys a pat on the back and I think that’s what’s so brilliant about the Millies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="best-unit-award"&gt;Best Unit Award&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highly coveted award for Best Unit went to &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/5974.aspx" title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3rd Battalion The Rifles&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3 RIFLES&lt;/abbr&gt;) for their work on Operation HERRICK. The unit were part of the Brigade Advisory Group mentoring the Afghan Army and Police. Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha presented the award to the unit, which is based in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, soldiers from &lt;abbr title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3 RIFLES&lt;/abbr&gt; took on the challenge of training the Afghan security forces. By building trust through shared dangers on the front line, they helped transform the capability of local forces. This approach was ably demonstrated on the day that Advisor 40 - a company of men that was part of &lt;abbr title="3rd Battalion The Rifles"&gt;3 RIFLES&lt;/abbr&gt; - risked their lives to save a badly injured Afghan soldier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of their arrival to mentor Afghan troops in Lashkar Gah, a rogue Afghan soldier from the base next door shot 2 British servicemen at the gates. Refusing to be cowed, despite the obvious risks, this event showed the dedication of the soldiers to the task at hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 3 months later, 3 British troops raced over open ground under enemy fire to rescue an Afghan who had been shot, gave life-saving first aid, and then ran back, all under fire. This was just one example of the commitment and courage of the troops carrying out advisory roles in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental Sergeant Major) James Mockridge said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="Prime Minister"&gt;PM&lt;/abbr&gt; thanked us and said he was really pleased with our achievements in moving the Afghan National Army forward in the campaign. Hopefully it has put us in a better place than when we started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether it was the cherry on the cake to have the Prime Minister hand over the award, &lt;abbr title="Warrant Officer Class 1"&gt;WO1&lt;/abbr&gt; Mockridge said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most definitely! For our unit, the honour doesn’t get much higher than the Prime Minister giving us an award. It’s not only fantastic for us but for all the Riflemen back in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/4685336/the-sun-military-awards-2012-roll-of-honour.html" title="Sun Military Awards roll of honour"&gt;The Millies&lt;/a&gt; awards ceremony on ITV1 at 2100hrs on Friday 14 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Soldiers offer ground expertise to aerial assets in Afghanistan </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Army &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx" title="Apache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are often called upon to neutralise enemy threats, the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" title="Royal Air Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; plays an equally important role with their impressive fleet of fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fearsome aerial assets fly out of Kandahar and, although the pilots and support crew are based well outside &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/" title="British Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; circles, they have direct access to all things green courtesy of skilled ground liaison officers (GLOs) who are embedded within their squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such personnel act as a link between the 2 Services to ensure those in the air have a clear understanding of the situation below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornado.cfm" title="Tornado GR4"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; Force’s War Week exercise at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/" title="RAF Marham"&gt;RAF Marham&lt;/a&gt;, Captain James Perring of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/24651.aspx" title="1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment"&gt;1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about taking everything that is happening on the ground and translating that into basic speak for the aircrew. They have no idea about the situation on the ground so we talk them through the process. I get involved with anything that is Army-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to give as much information as possible so when they are up in the sky they know where people are and what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring is now on a four-month deployment with &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/9squadron.cfm" title="9 Squadron"&gt;9 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan and the serviceman was quick to highlight the differences between his roles with the RAF and Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Ground Liaison Officer"&gt;GLO&lt;/abbr&gt; is a posting I applied for and is something completely different. I had no idea or appreciation of how air assets work so it has given me great insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is going to be an interesting tour and in a way I will have a greater understanding of the bigger picture in Afghanistan compared to spending 6 months on foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5427/tornadosg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Major Jeremy Higgins (left) and Captain James Perring joined the Tornado Force for the War Week exercise at RAF Marham [Picture: Graeme Main, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working with the RAF has been a bit of a culture shock. Sometimes the bureaucracy can be frustrating but it works for them and it is like that for a reason. It has been hard to adjust but there are positives to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Perring was not the only soldier involved in War Week. Major Jeremy Higgins of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/23445.aspx" title="Royal Artillery"&gt;Royal Artillery&lt;/a&gt;, a reservist who is a director for Cross Country Trains, was also on hand to offer expert advice and guidance from an Army perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise is designed to test personnel on the scenarios they are likely to face in theatre and the officer was determined to add as much realism as possible. Major Higgins said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are trying to ensure the aircrew get the training they need ahead of the deployment, while tying in with other agencies such as forward air controllers. It is about orchestrating different elements in the air and on the ground so when the jets go out they get the training they require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will be talking to troops in the field beforehand, asking what they need and what they are trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The aircrew also highlight the areas they want to work on, such as night missions, and the soldiers come up with different scenarios for them. Effectively we have two serials feeding into one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a close link between the two forces, GLOs are mindful of not overloading their airborne colleagues with unfamiliar Army tactics and thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not just UK personnel who benefit from the support offered by the Tornado crews. Major Higgins explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Preparing a Tornado for take off" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5428/tornados3g.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;RAF personnel preparing a Tornado for take off at Kandahar Airfield (library image) [Picture: Corporal Andy Benson RAF, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It can be quite challenging as we cover the whole of Afghanistan and can be allocated anywhere. It is an international role and we have to get information from soldiers who do not have English as their first language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We give the aircrews some situational awareness and that can be quite important due to the various forces we work with. They have different kit, depending on what they are doing, so a footprint of life on the ground is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Toyota Hilux with guys in the back could be perceived as being the enemy, but it may also be local allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our role is about adding value in any way we can. We may be asked simple questions or ones that completely floor us. We interact with land troops to get a picture of what they want from the fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for aerial assets is inevitably strong as soldiers maintain the Army’s operational tempo and such requests mean the RAF are on high alert during the training cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squadron Leader Lisa Foy, the acting officer in command of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/aboutus/opswg.cfm" title="RAF Marham - Operations Wing"&gt;RAF Marham’s Operations Wing&lt;/a&gt;, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is always more demand than we can meet but we strive to match the requirements from Land whenever possible. We want to benefit the personnel on exercise while training the Tornado crews as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise that the Force needs to train with soldiers and War Week is the perfect opportunity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A lot of 9 Squadron’s training during this phase has been provided by the Army, and GLOs are critical in bringing everything together. Our expertise is in the air and these guys form a crucial link with the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report by Richard Long is taken from the December 2012 edition of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/soldier-magazine/soldier-magazine.aspx" title="Soldier magazine"&gt;Soldier&lt;/a&gt; - the magazine of the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>  Life Sciences Strategy: one year on</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="progress"&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that the UK has generated more than £1 billion on industry and private sector investment within 12 months.  This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£500 million from GSK to build its first new manufacturing plant in almost 40 years at Ulverston in Cumbria and invest more in its two sites at Montrose and Irvine in Scotland as a direct response to the introduction of the Patent Box&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£25 million leveraged in from the private sector to bridge the ‘Valley of Death’ adding to a government commitment of £49 million to 64 projects through the Biomedical Catalyst&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£294 million through the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (&lt;abbr title="UK Research Partnership Investment Fund"&gt;UK RPIF&lt;/abbr&gt;) from businesses and charities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real progress has been made working closely with companies across the sector to ensure the measures in the strategy are making a real difference to their work and their decisions to invest in and remain in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes investing £1 billion per annum through the National Institute for Health Research, which includes £500 million in our translational research infrastructure in the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; to boost networks between academia, industry and the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="revolutionising-the-fight-against-cancer"&gt;Revolutionising the fight against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Cameron also announced that the UK will be the first country in the world to introduce to introduce high-tech &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; mapping for cancer patients and those with rare diseases, within the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt;.  Up to  100,000 patients over three to five years will have their whole genome – their personal &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; code –sequenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genome profile will give doctors a new, advanced understanding of a patient’s genetic make-up, condition and treatment needs, ensuring they have access to the right drugs and personalised care far quicker than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to develop life-saving new drugs, treatments and scientific breakthroughs, which experts predict could significantly reduce the number of premature deaths from cancer within a generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has earmarked £100 million: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to train a new generation of British genetic scientists to lead on the development of new drugs, treatments and cures, building the UK as the world leader in the field. And train the wider healthcare community in harnessing this technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to pump-prime &lt;abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid"&gt;DNA&lt;/abbr&gt; sequencing for cancer and rare inherited diseases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to build the &lt;abbr title="National Health Service"&gt;NHS&lt;/abbr&gt; data infrastructure to ensure that this new technology leads to better care for patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="reaction"&gt;Reaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister for Science and Universities David Willetts said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life sciences is one of the most truly international sectors – so if we are to continue to be a world player and compete in the global race we must do everything we can to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the past year, our initiatives have attracted more than £1 billion of private sector investment to the UK. We can see clear evidence the UK is succeeding in creating the right environment to attract global investment to our shores and continue to be world leader in life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am announcing today that we are committing a further £100 million to support this sector out of the extra money for science announced by the chancellor in his Autumn Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Preferred bidder for the Fire Service College confirmed</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire minister said he was happy that the proposed sale of the college to Capita would achieve value for money for the public purse and secure the future of the college.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that we are making real progress in securing the future of such an important facility. It is vital for the development of the Fire Service College that we put it on a sound footing, giving the private sector a chance to provide innovation and investment that will guarantee the future of a world-class asset.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure best value for money for taxpayers and enable the college to continue in its role, a number of conditions will be imposed on the proposed sale. These include commitments that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the college be preserved as a national training centre for fire and rescue authorities&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it will continue to offer wider national resilience and emergency services training and exercises&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;government permission will be required if Capita wish to sell the incident ground&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councillor Kay Hammond, Chair of the Local Government Association’s fire services management committee, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is good news that government has listened to the views of the sector about the future of the Fire Service College and that it now looks set to get the outside investment it so badly needs. The Local Government Association and fire authorities will be keen to work with the future owners to help them transform the college into a first-class training facility fit for firefighters in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Fire Officers’ Association President, Vij Randeniya, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Chief Fire Officers’ Association welcomes the news that Capita has been selected. It has been a long and intensive process and we are glad that there is now clarity for the Fire Service College. We look forward to working closely with Capita to ensure that the very best provision is available for UK fire and rescue services.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government now looks forward to holding constructive discussions with Capita to ensure that the transition from public to private sector is as smooth as possible and expects to complete the sale early in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="further-information"&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire Service College is a trading fund and executive agency of the department. Since becoming a trading fund in 1992, it has never been able to pay a dividend out of operating profits. The government’s response to Fire Futures on 12 April 2011 concluded that the college could achieve its full potential only if there was greater involvement from other sectors in its ownership, operation and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Future Options project considered 4 options for the future of the college:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the status quo: the college remains as a trading fund of the department &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a government owned contractor operated model: the assets remain under government ownership but management of the college is taken over by a private sector company under a long term contract, together with the staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;disposal as a going concern: the college is sold to a private sector company who would continue to operate the college as a training centre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;closure: the college’s activities cease, staff are made redundant and the site is sold for an alternative use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the 4 options showed disposal as a going concern to be the best option, and the only one which both removes from government ongoing financial risks of ownership of the college and preserves a national training college for the fire and rescue service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers announced on 22 March 2012 that the Fire Service College would be sold as a going concern to a private sector company to continue operating as a training centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sale process was launched on 10 April 2012 and the due diligence phase concluded in October with the receipt of final bids. Best and final offers were received in November. The aim is to complete the sale in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Latest UK Armed Forces manning figures released</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is up from 97.4 per cent a year ago and shows a continuing upward trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18,630 new recruits have joined the UK Regular Forces in the 12 months to 30 June 2010. This is a decrease of 5,010 from the 12 months to 30 June 2009 as the Armed Forces are now very nearly fully-manned, meaning there is a reduced intake requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statistics also show that the number of people leaving the trained strength of the UK Regular Forces in the 12 months to 30 June 2010 has fallen by 9.8 per cent (1,990 people) compared with the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As at 1 July 2010, the full-time trained strength of the UK Armed Forces was 178,380, against a target of 178,880. This comprises 173,930 UK Regular Forces, 830 Full-Time Reserve Service personnel and 3,610 Gurkhas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Secretary of State for Defence, Andrew Robathan, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is encouraging to see that a career in our Armed Forces is proving to be a popular choice, so much so that we are at almost 100 per cent of our manning requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our personnel are some of the best in the world and the work they are doing in operational theatres and back in the UK demonstrates this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the numbers of people we need to recruit have reduced, recruitment continues, and, with more people staying in the Armed Forces too, we continue to strengthen all three Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1 July 2009, the proportion of females in the UK Regular Forces has remained static at 12.1 per cent for officers, and risen from 9.0 per cent to 9.1 per cent for other ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The percentage of UK Regular Forces from ethnic minority backgrounds has remained static at 6.6 per cent of UK Regular Forces since 1 July 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport for everyone </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker is calling on operators and local authorities to work with government to put accessibility and equality front and centre when delivering services for the travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help them to do this, the Department for Transport has published 2 action plans which set out priorities, as well as highlighting areas where action is in the pipeline or already underway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Transport for everyone’ outlines how operators, local councils and the Department can help to make it easier for people using public transport – particularly those with disabilities - to get to where they need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This action plan builds on the success achieved in improving accessibility on public transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. At the heart of the plan is the importance of improving door-to-door journeys rather than addressing issues in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s equality action plan looks at how we can encourage a more inclusive transport network and underlines the importance of ensuring that policy makers at all levels are alive to the particular needs and concerns of different groups in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include affordability issues for young people and pensioners and the ability for all people to travel in safety and free from harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Minister Norman Baker said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A good transport system allows people to access jobs, opportunities and vital services - it needs to work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We recognise the concerns that specific groups of people have about public transport and so we have pulled together ideas from across the transport sector on how these concerns can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The action plans will help policy makers, as well as transport operators, to tackle problems head on and - more importantly - to level the playing field for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liz Sayce OBE, Disability Rights UK Chief Executive, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An accessible transport infrastructure is essential for what Disability Rights UK wants to achieve – disabled people playing a full and equal part in society. Over the past 20 years we have come a long way as our practical guide ‘Doing transport differently’ shows but there are still too many attitudinal, communication and physical barriers facing disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Action plan’ is a step change towards making further progress. We welcome the commitment that the Department for Transport will continue to work in partnership with disabled people and our organisations to ensure the most effective steps are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ‘Accessibility action plan’ builds on the transport successes of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and aims to create a long lasting legacy of improved access and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Olympic and Paralympic Games, public transport operators carried thousands of spectators with disabilities and work was done to ensure that the travelling public had easy access to information. One of the aims of the ‘Accessibility action plan’ will be to build on the Games Spectator Journey Planner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new planner would cover a wider geographical area and more types of transport as well as being made accessible to people with visual impairments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other measures outlined in the plan include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;considering where £100 million of extra funding might be best spent in the long term to improve accessibility of railway stations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;possible further amendments to the Blue Badge scheme to tackle abuse and fraud in this area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building on guidance for mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs to encourage training for those using this equipment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘Equality action plan’ sets out in one place what the department is doing to ensure people from all parts of society have the option to use public transport. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points addressed in the plan include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility to public transport for young people, older people and those living in rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;safety and personal security for women travellers, particularly at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tackling hate crime and bullying on buses and other public transport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promoting employment of under-represented groups within the transport industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both documents include lists of issues and the actions that have been, or will be, taken to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest students graduate from Defence Academy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Defence Academy is the UK’s Defence higher educational establishment. It is responsible for post-graduate education and the majority of command, staff, leadership, Defence management, acquisition, and technology training for members of the UK armed forces and MOD civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Command and Staff Course comprises a number of modules looking at a wide spectrum of military, political and international issues and aims to prepare officers for high grade appointments by giving them a much greater knowledge of Defence as a whole, as well as exposing them to the challenges and complexities posed by working alongside other Government departments, and civilian organisations and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is also aimed at developing command, analytical and communication skills and providing a broad understanding and knowledge of single-Service, joint and combined operations, and of Defence as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as receiving lectures from the most senior officers and civil servants in the MOD, the Secretary of State for Defence and other Government Ministers have also attended over the last year, thus allowing students to gain insight into the structure and workings of the MOD and Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lectures, workshops, discussions, debate, table-top exercises, and external visits are combined with formal assessments and exams throughout the course. Add to that a 15,000 word research paper on a Defence-related subject chosen by the student, and you have a course that is very demanding intellectually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Advanced Command and Staff Course comprises a number of modules looking at a wide spectrum of military, political and international issues" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5413/Latest_students_graduate_from_Defence_Academy_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Advanced Command and Staff Course comprises a number of modules looking at a wide spectrum of military, political and international issues [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2011]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course is undertaken in partnership with King’s College London, and thus, while students gain the Staff College qualification there is also the opportunity to gain a Master’s degree in Military Studies alongside diplomas in Strategic Management and Leadership as part of the academic element of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 286 students (RN/RM 56, Army 72, RAF 63 and UK Govt Depts five) of which 90 are international students from 58 countries represent the top ten per cent of the officer cadre from across UK Defence and the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international students, who are fully integrated into all aspects of the course, come from the full range of NATO, European and Commonwealth countries, as well as a number from the Middle East, and from other countries as far afield as South Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Japan and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commandant of the Joint Services Command and Staff College, Air Vice-Marshal Ray Lock, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each year the Advanced Command and Staff Course provides a truly world-class education to 300 selected British, International Military and Civilian Officers who represent the top ten per cent of their generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The students’ successful completion of this Master’s-level course is a very significant achievement - it marks the end of an immensely demanding year where they have been challenged in many, many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Their exposure to military studies, to the higher management of Defence both in the UK and abroad, and to a wide range of global issues will enable them to flourish in the difficult and challenging future we all face, from whichever country they may come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The course has also proved to be an ideal opportunity to improve the relationship and all-round understanding between the UK students and the other 57 countries represented on the course, and it also gains the UK significant international influence. But it is all about the students - and this bunch has been tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Latest helmet saves soldiers' lives in Afghanistan</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranger Silbert Wilson, aged 20, Corporal Tommy Creighton, 25, and Ranger Alan Hawthorne, 23, all from Northern Ireland, walked away unscathed after Taliban bullets aimed at their heads were stopped by the recently-introduced Mark 7 combat helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three separate incidents follow another escape by their colleague Ranger Ryan Boyd, 26, also from 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment, who walked away with just a bruise after an insurgent round fired directly at him was stopped by his Osprey body armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Wilson, from Antrim, was the first to test the helmet’s strength. That day he went out with A Company on a normal morning patrol in the Nad ‘Ali district, part of furthering the soldiers’ understanding of the local area and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patrol had been on task for almost two hours, moving around compounds and interacting with locals, when they suddenly came under enemy small arms fire. The soldiers took cover in a 5-foot-deep (1.5m) irrigation ditch and got ready to return fire - but the incoming rounds then stopped as suddenly as they had started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of minutes’ wait, the patrol was moving out of the ditch into another, shallower irrigation channel when the Taliban fighters opened up on them again, this time with machine gun fire and single rounds coming from at least four different firing points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Wilson recalled: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single round landed about two metres in front of me. I was moving to get into better cover when suddenly it felt like someone punched me on the side of my head. I was pushed off my feet and ended up submerged in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was no time to think. I got up, fired my weapon back at the enemy firing points; once the magazine was empty I reloaded a fresh magazine, and only then started to check myself. My face first - no blood! I thought ‘thank &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;, that was really close!’. I was still confused and a bit dazed. My head was ringing - but I was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ranger Silbert Wilson and the Mark 7 combat helmet which saved his life" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5410/Latest_helmet_saves_soldiers__lives_in_Afghanistan_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Ranger Silbert Wilson and the Mark 7 combat helmet which saved his life [Picture: Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranger Wilson and the rest of the patrol subsequently conducted a fighting withdrawal out of contact, eventually returning to their checkpoint unscathed. Once they got back it became apparent he was not the only one to have experienced a close call that day - his colleague Lance Corporal Keith Morrison, from Templepatrick, had taken a shot clean through his daysack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Creighton, from Carrickfergus, was the next to feel the benefit of the Mark 7 helmet’s cutting-edge technology. He was out on patrol with B Company in Nad ‘Ali in the early hours of the morning, having been dropped off in a Mastiff vehicle operated by the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patrol was not far from a patrol base when they heard the sound of a round being fired in their direction. Corporal Creighton saw movement from a compound wall off to his side and, looking through his weapon sight, he identified an insurgent with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher on his shoulder. When the insurgent noticed that Corporal Creighton had seen him, he panicked, fired off the missile in his general direction and quickly ducked back behind the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullets then started coming at the soldiers from all directions, from multiple firing points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Creighton, along with colleagues Lance Corporal Fraser Stirling and Ranger Kevin McMaster, took cover in a dry drainage ditch and returned fire at identified firing points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Taliban opened up with some accurate small arms fire in our direction, and we were returning fire,” said Corporal Creighton. “As I was observing forward, confirming new enemy positions, it seemed like it happened in slow motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I saw the strike of a round hit the ground in front of me. I could actually see the strike - the dirt lifting. My reaction was to lower my head, tilting it slightly forward, and then I felt the thud against my helmet as the round struck me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I thought ‘&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;!’. My right leg started to shake. But I composed myself, identified the compound from where the round had come and engaged back returning fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contact with the insurgents carried on for a further three hours (a total of four). Eventually an Apache helicopter was called for and engaged the remaining insurgents, bringing the contact to a conclusion.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporal Creighton added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we got back to the patrol base, the lads were all looking at the helmet and saying how lucky I was. The round had struck me right on my ‘shamrock’ regimental badge, which I guess is kind of symbolic! But at the end of the day it’s a great bit of kit and that’s what it’s designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Hawthorne, from Dromore, was the third Royal Irish soldier to walk away after a bullet to the head. He had been conducting a clearance patrol with C Company in southern Nad ‘Ali and his platoon had taken up position in a local resident’s compound, with the owner’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing the soldiers do when they occupy a compound is to secure it and build a good overwatch position. As the one who carries the machine gun, Ranger Hawthorne is usually the first to give protection for the remainder of the patrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this occasion, just as his section commander had radioed through to confirm they were in place, shots began firing over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranger Hawthorne recalled: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we identified muzzle flash from the insurgents’ weapons and located their positions, we returned fire. As I was firing my machine gun, I felt a big thud - it was like someone had dropped a block on my head. It was a shock, but, with the enemy still firing at me, I had no choice but to keep returning fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When things quietened down, my section commander, Corporal Kyle Scott, tapped me on the shoulder - he was pointing to my head. That’s when I realised what had happened. I’d been so involved in the shooting that I had thought nothing more about the thud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the shooting finished, Corporal Scott called me down from my position. I took my helmet off. Lots of the boys gathered round and they were all pointing at the big gash the bullet had made in the side of my helmet. I have to say, I feel like a lucky boy, but it just shows the quality of the kit we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Jeffrey Herbert, spokesman for 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment, said of all the incidents: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These guys are all entitled to feel pretty lucky after what they’ve been through, but the fact we’ve now had three soldiers saved by this helmet goes to show what fantastic personal protective equipment we now have in the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aside from that though, I think the way all three of the lads kept their composure after being hit and carried on fighting, only thinking to assess the damage after the contact was over, says a great deal about the character of the Royal Irish Regiment. These lads are as much a credit to the British Army as the helmets that saved their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Latest counter-IED equipment showcased</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology, Peter Luff, formally opened this year’s show at the Millbrook vehicle testing ground in Bedfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Luff was then given a demonstration of some of the latest counter-IED (C-IED) equipment being used by British troops and met soldiers who had survived IED blasts thanks to the heavily armoured vehicles in which they were travelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the event he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tackling the IED threat is vital for us to make military progress. C-IED is not just about the bomb disposal expert defusing a bomb, vital and dangerous though that role is. It is about making sure that our soldiers have a range of tools, tactics and techniques available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Luff was given a guided tour of the five pieces of equipment that make up Talisman, the newest military solution to the IED problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five elements consist of two enormous armoured vehicles, a JCB digger, a bomb disposal robot and a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Talisman system is currently being used by Royal Engineers to clear and build safe routes around Helmand province in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mastiff armoured vehicle and its crew act as Talisman’s eyes, with video screens inside the rear compartment of the truck displaying aerial video footage gathered by a Honeywell T-Hawk UAV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another armoured vehicle known as Buffalo has a remote-controlled, extendable, pronged arm attached to the front, which is used to comb or ‘rummage’ the ground, detecting signs of IEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Talon remote-controlled robot forms part of the latest counter-IED technology" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5408/Latest_counter-IED_equipment_showcased_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Talon remote-controlled robot forms part of the latest counter-IED technology [Picture: Andrew Linnett, Crown Copyright/MOD 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JCB digger is used to fill in ditches or potholes that might prevent soldiers or vehicles from moving forward and the Talon remote-controlled robot gives troops the safer option of remaining out of harm’s way when trying to deal with any devices they find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Captain Paul Ridge, the head of the Military Manouevre Support Team that spent around 18 months developing the Talisman system, said the aim was to enable soldiers to move around the battlefield more easily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a range of equipment that has been brought together to make a system which allows early detection and the choice of either avoiding or destroying the IED.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It can be used on its own or in support of other vehicles. And the whole system can be operated from under armour. It’s just one part of the contribution towards counter-IED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soldiers from 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh who survived two IED blasts in two days while in Afghanistan met the minister and described how the heavily armoured vehicles in which they were travelling probably saved their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusilier Danny Hughes, who was travelling in one vehicle when it hit a roadside bomb, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Mastiff is worth its weight in gold. The second time it happened there weren’t any injuries either, it was almost a case of ‘here we go again’, that’s another few hours until we can have a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle to beat the IEDs is the driving force behind an MOD contract for a tranche of 200 new Light Protected Patrol Vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two companies, SupaCat and Force Protection Europe, are competing for the contract and displayed prototype models of what they hope will be the next generation of Light Protected Patrol Vehicles (LPPVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicles will be used for a variety of patrols and so must be tough enough to cope with cross-country terrain, but also enable the troops inside to engage with the local people they encounter in more urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, Chief of Defence Materiel and the Head of Defence Equipment and Support, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As well as its protection against blasts, the LPPV must be able to operate in the harsh conditions of the desert and tight urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Luff added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will agree a contract for an initial tranche of 200 vehicles under an Urgent Operational Requirement funded from the Treasury Reserve later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first batch of vehicles is required for training by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the DVD event Mr Luff also announced a contract for more than 140 extra Jackal 2A weapons-mounted patrol vehicles in a deal worth about £45m, bringing the number of Jackal vehicles for Defence to over 500, and an extra 28 Wolfhound heavy tactical support vehicles under a £20m deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the MOD is reducing the weight troops on the front line carry with improvements to current and future infantry combat and support kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the average weight of equipment carried by an infantryman is around 66kg, but innovative weight-saving schemes have shaved more than 4.5kg from this. New kit being delivered in October could reduce this by a further 8kg. Measures implemented include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trials of new lightweight patrol rations for troops in the field that weigh less than 1kg, compared with a 24-hour ration pack that weighs around 3kg; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;new longer-life batteries to power radios and other equipment; and &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new battery recharging system which reduces the number of spare batteries required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After inspecting some of the equipment at the annual DVD event and talking to soldiers and suppliers, Minister for International Security Strategy, Gerald Howarth, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the modern combat soldier is better equipped than ever before, this has brought about its own challenges - mainly an increase in the weight being carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The welfare of our troops is paramount and so the work being carried out here to reduce this burden is essential to both the physical and mental well-being of our troops fighting on the front line in what can be 50-degree temperatures. The other improvements announced today are a further demonstration of our determination to equip our forces on the front line with the kit they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A newly-formed project team, - the Integrated Soldier System Executive, based at Defence Equipment and Support in Bristol, has been leading on the work to reduce the weight carried on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with lightening a soldier’s load, the welfare of personnel operating in remote locations is being improved through increasing the number of e-bluey computer terminals to enable them to communicate with loved ones and installing more showers, sinks and toilets in forward operating bases. The new ablutions facilities will be sent to Afghanistan later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Iranian investigation into death of detained blogger is missed opportunity for justice</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking the 40th day anniversary of the death of Sattar Beheshti, Foreign Officer Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is now forty days since the blogger Sattar Beheshti died in custody in Iran. I would like to use this occasion to extend my condolences to his family. That the Iranian authorities instigated an investigation into Sattar’s tragic death should have been a positive step. However, once again the authorities have failed to deliver justice. Neither Sattar’s family who have reportedly faced harassment and threats from the security services, nor Sattar’s countrymen and women have been given credible answers about the events that led to his death. Instead, the state-controlled media and the parliament have dismissed his death as a heart attack brought on by a fear of arrest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sattar was right to be afraid of the security forces and what could happen to him in jail. The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention. We are deeply disappointed that having taken the initiative to investigate,  Iran has been unwilling to hold those responsible to account. The sacking of the head of Cyber Police will not stop the security and detention forces from operating with impunity. Systemic change is needed to bring about a more transparent and accountable system.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Last training on the Navy's Merlin Mk1 helicopter</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen trainee pilots, observers and aircrewmen from 824 Naval Air Squadron at Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose are spending five weeks flying on, off and around aviation training ship Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel Argus. They are the last crews to train on the Mk1 variant of the aircraft before the Merlin Mk2 joins the Fleet Air Arm later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trainees have completed between two and four years of training and instruction both on simulators and on the genuine article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But their stint on the 28,000-tonne training ship - which doubles as the Navy’s casualty treatment vessel in times of war - is their first taste of operating the Merlin, which is the mainstay of the Royal Navy’s anti-submarine and counter-piracy operations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aboard Argus, the trainees go from the basics of landing on and taking off from a flight deck at sea to practising search and rescue drills, then on to tactical missions such as hunting submarines or surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student pilot Sub-Lieutenant Will Legge said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You learn so much more in the real world than you do on a simulation. The real world provides 100 times more variation, things that you can never plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And if things go wrong, you cannot just press ‘reset’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Completing the first deck landing is a milestone. You are pretty nervous beforehand, because the deck looks tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Merlin Mk1 helicopter on the aircraft lift of RFA Argus" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5382/Last_training_on_the_Navy_s_Merlin_Mk1_helicopter_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A Merlin Mk1 helicopter on the aircraft lift of RFA Argus [Picture: LA(Phot) Dave Sterratt, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea Flight Commander and senior 824 Naval Air Squadron instructor aboard RFA Argus, Lieutenant Commander Mike Currie, said of the five-week training spell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is where we put into practice all that has been taught previously - it is almost the final hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You have to have a certain temperament to succeed, a certain Fleet Air Arm ethos, but the pilots, observers, aircrewmen, they are all individuals. There’s no one trait and we’re certainly not trying to produce carbon copies of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commander Gavin Richardson, 824 Naval Air Squadron’s Commanding Officer, added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The embarked period is what the squadron team effort works toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is the crowning glory of a long and arduous road for our students which provides the opportunity to show the investment was worthwhile and that they have metamorphosed into naval aviators, able to operate and fly from that most demanding environment - the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the students come through the training, they will earn their wings in June and go on to join one of three front line Merlin squadrons based at Culdrose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they will be the last of scores of Merlin crews to pass through the squadron and the impressive simulator and training complex at the air station on the Lizard Peninsula since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merlin was originally introduced as a submarine hunter to replace the venerable Sea King. It has since grown into a general purpose helicopter capable of interdicting pirates and drug runners, saving the lives of stricken mariners, and delivering stores and people, as well as fulfilling its original anti-submarine mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first next-generation naval Merlin, the Mk2, arrives in Cornwall this summer. Although outwardly the helicopter is almost identical, inside the cockpit and the command consoles are entirely new:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no comparison with other aircraft out there,” said Lieutenant Commander Currie, who has 1,800 Merlin flying hours under his belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty awesome when it comes to what it can do - especially the variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Things have moved on since the Mk1. It has served us well - and still serves us well - but it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;824 Naval Air Squadron will learn the ins and outs of the new helicopters first before the rest of the Merlin community gets to grip with them and it begins front line deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Last soldier from Fromelles laid to rest in new cemetery</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new cemetery, built near the site of the battle in northern France, was dedicated in the ceremony by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soldiers were recently discovered in mass graves, and yesterday’s ceremony, on the 94th anniversary of the battle, marks the end of a two-year project to give them a fitting final place of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony began when the coffin of the last soldier was borne out of Pheasant Wood, location of the original graves, on a WWI Mark X General Service Wagon pulled by horses from the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procession journeyed through the village of Fromelles, and was joined by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and Her Excellency The Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce, along with Chief of the General Staff, General Sir David Richards, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, Australian Chief of Army, and soldiers from the British and Australian Armies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Minister Lord Astor, who attended the service, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today saw the last of the 250 WWI Battle of Fromelles soldiers honoured with the dignity of an individual burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So far we have been able to identify by name 96 of these soldiers and many others have been confirmed as having served in the Australian and British Army. It is hoped that over the next four years we can determine the names of more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The new Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery at Fromelles, northern France" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/5374/Last_soldier_from_Fromelles_laid_to_rest_in_new_cemetery_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery at Fromelles, northern France [Picture: Jon Garrett, Commonwealth War Graves Commission 2010]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service was attended by hundreds of members of British and Australian families whose relatives were killed in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many took part in the service, reading extracts from letters and diaries from those they lost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffin was borne by soldiers from the British and Australian armies, and a joint firing party fired three shots, followed by a one minute silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wreaths were then laid by HRH The Prince of Wales, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, and Monsieur Hubert Falco, the French Minister of State for Defence and Veterans, and the cemetery was dedicated by His Royal Highness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief of the General Staff, General Sir David Richards, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The British and Australian soldiers who fought and died at the Battle of Fromelles faced tremendous adversity. This splendid new cemetery is a moving tribute to them all, and will serve as a reminder of their sacrifice for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HRH The Duke of Kent, President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is right and fitting that these men - comrades, allies, and even two brothers - lie side by side in this beautiful cemetery - the first new war cemetery to be built by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in fifty years. They are lost no longer, and are here at last, at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverend Mitchell Collins from Fife, grandson of Private Mitchell Collins of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment who was killed in the Battle of Fromelles, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My father grew up never having met his father, so the Battle of Fromelles will leave an indelible mark on our family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although we have not yet been able to identify Private Collins as one of the soldiers buried here, I am hoping that over the next few years new evidence will come to light which will help us to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ceremony today was very moving for my family, and a fitting tribute to those who fell in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Fromelles began on 19 July 1916, 19 days after the opening of the Somme campaign, and was the first major battle on the Western Front involving Australian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 5th Australian Division suffered losses of 5,533 either killed, wounded, taken prisoner or missing; and the 61st British Division suffered 1,547 similar losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth War Graves Commission’s records suggest that between 19 and 20 July 1916 the Australian dead at Fromelles amounted to 1,780, the British 503.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Last RAF convoy comes home following Libya operations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Stephen met personnel from No 2 Mechanical Transport Squadron (2 MTS) as they arrived back at their base in RAF Wittering, Cambridgeshire. He chatted with the drivers and got a first-hand account of the challenges they faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the two-hour visit, Sir Stephen took the opportunity to drive an Oshkosh Close Support Tanker (adorned with a 4-star plate), before visiting the 2 MTS Operations Room, No 5001 Squadron’s Station Engineering Flight and No 3 Mobile Catering Squadron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Op ELLAMY, the UK operation over Libya, 2 MTS’s vehicles drove 1,169,986 miles (1,882,910km); which is equivalent to travelling around the equator more than 47 times, and carried 8,540 tonnes of freight - the equivalent of 813 Hercules aircraft loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 MTS suffered the only operational fatality of the Operation, with the sad loss of Senior Aircraftman James Smart, who was involved in a Road Traffic Accident as his convoy was transiting through southern Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing personnel, Sir Stephen said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think there’s no question that, without the support units here, whether it be 2 MT, the hangar erectors, the people who keep everything going, and those who keep us fed in various parts of the world recently, we would not have been able to be as effective as we have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His final trip retraced the steps of his first journey with the Squadron more than a decade ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My first encounter with the Squadron was 12 years ago when I travelled down with them to Gioia del Colle, and my last trip with 2 MT was to the same destination,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journeys to and from southern Italy ferried cargoes varying from to explosive ordnance to aircraft wheels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s quite a lonely trip, four days there, four days back,” said Sgt Merrix. “It’s a challenge to do 4,000 miles [6,437km] on your own and maintain the level of concentrations you have to apply. We do stop regularly, but on the continent it can be difficult sometimes to find somewhere to park 10 trucks overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Captain Richard Hill, Station Commander at RAF Wittering, summarised the performance of his personnel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Op ELLAMY represented the first time for many years that the RAF has undertaken an expeditionary operation. The role played by units and personnel from the station was crucial in delivering, at pace and over extended lines of communication, many of the logistics and supporting services necessary to enable the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am extremely proud of the contribution that these personnel have made, and delighted that the Chief of the Air Staff took the time and trouble to visit RAF Wittering and pass on his personal appreciation to a cross-section of the personnel who had been involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Op ELLAMY has again highlighted the importance of logistic support and underlined the role of the RAF’s logistics personnel on deployed operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will continue to refine the level and types of support we provide, and continue to develop/enhance the working relationship we have with Headquarters Air Command, and the Expeditionary Air Wings, such that we are able to meet whatever challenges may arise in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Government accepts proposals to improve garage standards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists are being encouraged to find out if their garage is approved by a set of industry-standard codes to make sure they are getting value for money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call comes after the government accepted a number of proposals made by industry experts to help drive up standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Motorists’ Forum has set out a raft of recommendations aimed at making sure motorists have the best possible consumer experience when having their vehicles serviced or repaired in a report released today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will promote the wider adoption of self-regulation (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;-&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) codes of practice by garages and encourage greater publication of information regarding services they offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an AA survey*, 78% of people always use the same garage meaning that only a minority of motorists shop around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I welcome the work carried out by the Motorists’ Forum and believe the recommendations will help build on existing best practice in the industry without the burden of extra legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is important that consumers feel confident in the quality and the value for money of the services they are receiving from garages. The Forum’s report has offered some useful proposals for how this can be achieved more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would urge motorists to find out if their local garage has been approved by the codes to ensure they are getting a fair service and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will now use their strong relationships with the industry and stakeholders to promote the adopted recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK car service and repair sector is worth around £6.9 billion per year to the GB economy with 150,000 MOT tests taking place every working day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="note-to-editors"&gt;Note to editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum report on garage customer experience can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-motorists-forum-sub-group-on-improving-customer-service-experience-at-garages"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s response can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-motorists-forum-report-on-garage-customer-experience"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Motorists’ Forum is made up of a group of experts convened by the DfT. Organisations include the AA, RAC, &lt;abbr title="Association of Chief Police Officers"&gt;ACPO&lt;/abbr&gt;, Centre for Automotive Management, &lt;abbr title="compulsory basic training"&gt;CBT&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Transport for London"&gt;TfL&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Association Of British Insurers"&gt;ABI&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Freight Transport Association"&gt;FTA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association"&gt;BVRLA&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety"&gt;PACTS&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders"&gt;SMMT&lt;/abbr&gt; as well as representatives from the DfT and Highways Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Trading Standards Institute (&lt;abbr title="Trading Standards Institute"&gt;TSI&lt;/abbr&gt;) will be taking over responsibility for the consumer codes approval scheme from the Office of Fair Trading (&lt;abbr title="Office of Fair Trading"&gt;OFT&lt;/abbr&gt;). The new scheme will maintain the rigour of the current scheme, but will streamline the approval process and make it self-funding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responsibility for vehicle roadworthiness and testing lies with DfT and &lt;abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency"&gt;VOSA&lt;/abbr&gt; administers the MOT scheme. Responsibility for consumer protection legislation lies with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is already considerable consumer protection legislation in place to cover the practices of garages which choose to trade unfairly or who are not competent to trade; both from the perspective of individual consumer rights through sale of goods and services legislation, and through the application of criminal sanctions, principally via the Consumer Protection from unfair trading regulations&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Improving motoring services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road users, businesses and other stakeholders were today invited to suggest improvements to the way motoring services such as driving tests and vehicle licensing are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is putting customers firmly at the heart of the way motoring services are delivered so that they best serve the consumer while getting the best possible deal for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the Department for Transport is outlining broad reform proposals for the 4 motoring services agencies: Driving Standards Agency (DSA); Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA); Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads Minister Stephen Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you drive, run a business or pay taxes you will be a customer of ours and I hope you will have your say about how we can improve the services we offer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much progress has already been achieved and it is now much easier to use digital services to get driving licences, and sort out vehicle tax. We have also already announced that we are bringing the driving test closer to customers by exploring a range of different locations, such as colleges and retail premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there is more that can be done and this consultation is about the government listening to its customers before agreeing the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department’s 4 agencies are already engaged in programmes of reform to deliver long term financial stability and efficiency, and better services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation sets out a longer term view of the future of these reforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position the agencies at the forefront of digital services, ensuring that those who find access to digital services difficult are supported to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support economic growth and vehicle manufacturing by reforming the Vehicle Certification Agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the driving test closer to the customer by exploring opportunities to improve convenience to customers. This includes assessing options for the delivery of the practical test. We are keen to explore all options that maintain the integrity of the test and high quality standards whoever is the provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transform &lt;abbr title="heaviy goods vehicle"&gt;HGV&lt;/abbr&gt;, bus and coach testing by expanding joint ventures and collaboration with private sector providers, and reducing the number of government owned test stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliver better customer services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider rationalising the number of bodies and agencies involved in delivering services - delivering services as simply as possible, increasing flexibility and innovation, improving efficiency and reducing costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 7 March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation is the department’s response to the government’s broader vision for public services as set out in the civil service reform plan, the Open Public Services white paper and the government digital strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The consultation document can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/motoring-services-strategy"&gt;GOV.UK website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Skills for life survey reveals English and maths levels of adults</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skills for Life examines the maths, English and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) levels of 16-65 year olds across England. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest findings found that in some areas, around a quarter of adults have the numeracy skills of a seven to nine year old or below. In Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands and the South East, there was a boost in literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/imagelibrary/downloadmedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=6131&amp;amp;SizeId=-1"&gt;Regional breakdown of the findings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the survey, Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said that adults with poor English and maths skills should make the most of free Government help. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Good English and maths are vital for getting a job and playing a full part in society. We have doubled the funding for adult English and maths because they are so important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would urge anyone who is struggling to take advantage of the provision that is on offer which now includes maths and English GCSEs for adults who missed out the first time round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These essential skills are the building blocks of a productive society and a thriving economy. I am determined that everyone - no matter where they live - should have the chance to achieve their very best.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="five-ways-we-use-maths-everyday"&gt;Five ways we use maths everyday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding offers in shops e.g. buy one get one free, two for the price of one, 20% off &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding the pay and deductions on your payslip &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning a journey by train or bus and reading timetables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take/give the right amount of medicine/pills for you or a member of your family&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work out the best mobile phone deal that you can afford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="help-available"&gt;Help available&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government has introduced a number of measures to improve the nation’s basic skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free maths and English GCSEs for adults since August&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continued funding of basic English and maths courses for adults&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New study programmes for young people from September 2013 in which students will continue to work towards GCSE A*-C in English and maths if they do not have this by 16&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consultation on the introduction of new English Baccalaureate Certificates for young people in six core academic subjects including English and maths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults wanting to brush up on their maths, English and ICT skills can contact the &lt;a href="nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk"&gt;National Careers Service&lt;/a&gt; for advice or call them on 0800 100 900 for information on courses available via the National Careers Service course directory.&lt;/p&gt;
