    <title>New figures show government is winning war on red tape</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business will benefit from nearly £1 billion in reduced red tape costs thanks to Government action, independent figures revealed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fifth Statement of New Regulation reports that the overall closing balance for ‘One-in, One-out’, the Government rule that dictates that every new cost on business must be balanced by an equivalent saving, is predicted to be around £836 million since January 2011. These figures are independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the statement shows that the Government expects to reduce the regulatory burden by around a further £83 million between January 2013 - when ‘One-in, One-Out’ is replaced by ‘One-in, Two-out’ - and June 2013.  Expected measures include reforms to environmental regulation, employment law and consumer law.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said that Whitehall is increasingly putting the needs of businesses centre stage, but vowed to go further and faster to roll back barriers to growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every department is predicting either a zero balance or being in credit at the start of One-in, Two-out, showing that the de-regulatory agenda is having an impact right across Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report shows that the overwhelming majority of Government measures affecting business are deregulatory, with only ten new items imposing new costs on business compared with 89 that will save money or will impose a zero net cost. The costs from the ‘ins’ (£6 million) are also dwarfed by the savings from the ‘outs’ (£89 million), giving a predicted net saving to business of £83 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent deregulatory measures include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes to modernise and simplify the registration of company charges, saving £21.9 million.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A series of changes to building regulations to reduce cost and complexity for industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less heavy-handed Health and Safety regulations for low-risk businesses including shop and offices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to speed up processes covering adoption and foster-carer eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Government has a very simple objective: to make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business.  This requires a fundamental culture change in Whitehall, so that new regulation is only imposed as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve made a promising start, but firms still struggle with excessive red tape.  We’ll now push departments to go further to bear down on costs imposed on business, and we’ll fight harder to get EU bureaucracy off the back of our entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time this Statement sets out EU measures that will be introduced during the reporting period, giving businesses time to prepare for these changes.   Fifty-seven EU measures are expected to be implemented into UK legislation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every six months the government publishes a Statement of New Regulation listing of all the regulations it plans to introduce and remove in the next six months, and showing the net direct costs to business. The Fifth Statement of New Regulation is available &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-impact-of-regulation-on-business/supporting-pages/operating-a-one-in-two-out-rule-for-business-regulation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ‘One-in, One-out’ rule was introduced on 1 September 2010 and applies to regulations introduced from January 2011.  The rule prevents any government department introducing new regulation that will impose a direct net cost on business and voluntary organisations - unless the department can find savings by removing or modifying another regulation of an equivalent cost. ‘One-in, Two-out’ will also operate in this way, but the removal or modification must be of twice the equivalent cost. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like ‘One-in, One-out’ , ‘One-in, Two-Out’ will not apply to EU legislation unless it has been converted into UK law in a way that goes beyond minimum EU requirements, putting UK businesses at a disadvantage.  A number of other areas are exempt from the rule, including tax administration and civil emergencies regulation. More detail is available &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-impact-of-regulation-on-business"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When developing a new regulatory or deregulatory proposal, each Government department must carry out an impact assessment. This includes estimating the likely cost to business. To ensure estimates are credible, the impact assessment is considered by an independent body, the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Red Tape Challenge is systematically examining some 6,500 substantive regulations that the Government inherited, with the aim of scrapping or significantly reducing as many of them as possible. It gives business and the public the chance to have their say, by theme, on the regulations that affect their everyday lives. The Government announced on 10 September 2012 that at least 3,000 of the regulations examined will be scrapped or reduced. A second phase of the Red Tape Challenge will start in spring 2013.  More information on the Red Tape Challenge is avaiable &lt;a href="www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alongside the drive to remove superfluous regulation, Government is working to ensure that necessary regulations on business are enforced more efficiently. Focus on Enforcement reviews are being carried out across a number of sectors where aspects of the enforcement regime may be imposing unnecessary burdens on business, making inefficient use of public sector resources or hampering economic growth.  At Autumn Statement, the Government also announced a number of measures to tackle systemic issues, including the lack of consistent fees and charges and appeals mechanisms. The Focus on Enforcement website is available &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/iscuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Government tackles red tape head on with package of measures</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review of the way that appeals are handled by regulators launched today is the first stage of a new wave of bureaucracy busting measures announced by the government, Business Minister Michael Fallon confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses and other interested parties will have a chance to take part in a review of the effectiveness of appeals mechanisms operated by national and local regulators. The Focus on Enforcement Appeals Review will give those affected the opportunity to talk about their experiences of formal and informal appeals processes, and suggest how they could be made to work more effectively, providing a swifter route to resolution and better industry understanding.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review will also gather examples of approaches that have successfully helped businesses understand regulators’ decisions and meet their obligations more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have started a bonfire of excessive red tape, but I know that it is just as important that we look at the way that regulations are enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is room for far more effective enforcement which reduces the burden on business which stick to the rules.  Despite best efforts, sometimes things can go wrong – that has become clear from previous Focus on Enforcement Reviews. So I want to hear views on how we can improve the way appeals currently work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Greater clarity and trust between regulators and businesses will lead to better enforcement of the law and higher standards across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest review follows a package of new measures announced at the Autumn Statement to tackle systemic problems with the way regulations are enforced and cut the unnecessary red tape and burdens that companies have to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a consultation on placing a legislative duty on non-economic regulators to have regard to growth and take into account the economic impacts of their actions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new accounting system for regulators, so that in future regulators will have to publish impact assessments for prior consultation, scrutiny and challenge by industry, of the impacts of all changes in their activities that have a significant (positive and negative) financial impact on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a consultation on an amended Regulators’ Compliance Code to ensure regulators are internally and geographically consistent, give consideration to earned recognition, and offer minimum service standards to those they regulate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;government action to ensure regulators are transparent about the fees they charge and bear down on their costs and improve their efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also today, as part of the package the government announced plans to cut bureaucracy by widening the range of regulations included in the Primary Authority scheme. The plans would see the scheme covering age-related sales of gambling, the Housing Health and Safety Rating system for assessing potential hazards in dwellings, sun-bed tanning and Welsh regulations for single-use carrier bag charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon added: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Primary Authority partnerships are reducing regulatory burdens for companies and allowing them to grow. It’s now time to extend the scope of the scheme to streamline the way regulators work with businesses, improve protections to the public and help local authorities to target their resources against rogue traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major business groups such as the CBI, British Retail Consortium and FSB are strongly in favour of Primary Authority and of its extension. The Trading Standards Institute and Chartered Institute of Environmental Health are also in favour.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evidence arising from sector-specific Focus on Enforcement reviews has already indicated that businesses have concerns about how current appeals systems operate. These include confusing or multiple appeals mechanisms lack of transparency and in some cases resolution taking excessively long periods of time.   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The forthcoming review will invite evidence from all sectors of the economy and any regulatory regime. Appeals mechanisms for economic regulators are not included in the scope of this review. Interested parties can participate in the review of appeals at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement"&gt;http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Last year at Budget, the government announced a new approach to cutting red tape, looking at how rules are enforced, rather than the rules themselves. A series of Focus on Enforcement Reviews have shown that in addition to sector-specific issues, there are also systemic enforcement issues limiting industry that affect most if not all sectors. So, rather than tackling systemic issues case by case, the Government’s Autumn Statement package  aims to change the system, creating greater clarity and fairness for businesses while ensuring regulators focus their resources where they are needed most. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Primary Authority Scheme is run by the Better Regulation Delivery Office, an independent unit within the Business Innovation and Skills Department (BIS). See &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/brdo/primary-authority"&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/brdo/primary-authority&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are currently 602 businesses and 93 local authorities involved in Primary Authority partnerships, covering over 58,000 premises and over 1.57 million employees. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending the scope of the scheme, or the list of regulations which can be covered by partnerships, can be achieved by secondary legislation. The consultation announced today runs until 24 January 2013 to allow feedback from stakeholders before secondary legislation is introduced into Parliament.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) is a risk-based evaluation tool to help local authorities identify and protect against potential risks and hazards to health and safety from any deficiencies identified in dwellings. It was introduced under the Housing Act 2004 and applies to residential properties in England and Wales.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s economic policy objective is to achieve ‘strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is more evenly shared across the country and between industries’. It set four ambitions in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf"&gt;‘Plan for Growth’ (PDF 1.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;, published at Budget 2011:
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to create the most competitive tax system in the G20&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;to make the UK the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a business&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;to encourage investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;to create a more educated workforce that is the most flexible in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work is underway across government to achieve these ambitions, including progress on more than 250 measures as part of the Growth Review. Developing an Industrial Strategy gives new impetus to this work by providing businesses, investors and the public with more clarity about the long-term direction in which the government wants the economy to travel.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Autumn Statement 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Autumn Statement is one of two major statements the Treasury has to give to parliament every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Statement provides an update on the Government’s plans for the economy based on the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. These forecasts are published alongside the Autumn Statement on 5 December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From today’s update of the government’s spending plans, the Department for Business has secured £2.4 billion of additional funding to support growth, with a focus on skills and science projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This money reinforces the government’s commitment to plan for medium and long term recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will aid the development of an industrial strategy to shape and rebalance our economy, in partnership with business. This will drive growth, create the jobs of the future and help us get ahead in the global race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="main-announcements-for-bis"&gt;Main announcements for BIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional £600 million for science, research and innovation, which takes the total investment since the 2010 spending review to an additional £1.5 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £270 million to be spent on laboratories, classrooms and other facilities in our Further Education colleges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1 billion confirmed for the business bank, which will address the long-term structural gap in lending to small businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An extra £120 million invested in supply chains, to encourage companies to invest here in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Regional Growth Fund will also receive an additional £350 million, bringing the total available in 2012-13 to £2.75 billion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first stage of the government’s response to Lord Heseltine’s independent review on economic growth, ‘No Stone Unturned’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra money for the Employer Ownership Pilot, taking it to £340 million overall and giving businesses funding so they can design and develop their own training programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased funding of £140 million for UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) to help small and medium sized business export abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;£1.5 billion to help our smallest companies to access growing markets overseas. For the first time UK Export Finance, the Government’s export credit agency, will be able to issue loans to overseas customers and buyers wanting to purchase goods from UK businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A package of measures to cut back red tape that business has told government stops them from growing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-and-innovation"&gt;Science and Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Spending Review in 2010 the yearly £4.6 billion funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms and ring-fenced during the spending review period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra £600 million announced today will be invested in facilities for technological research and development and Research Council infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amounts to an additional £1.5 billion of capital funding for science, research and innovation since the beginning of the Review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investment will support the development of innovative technologies and strengthen the UK‘s competitive advantage in areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big data and energy efficient computing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced materials.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details about how the £600 million will be spent will be published in due course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science budget will continue to be protected and ring-fenced for the rest of the Spending Review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paving the way to business freedom</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 Oct 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest package of measures will help cut unnecessary red tape and take steps towards creating the right conditions for businesses to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amendments have been published ahead of the Bill’s report stage and third reading in the House of Commons, taking place on 16 and 17 October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals to free up business include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing automatic liability on business for civil damages in health and safety cases, when they are not found negligent. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exempting intermediary companies from the Estate Agents Act, to encourage new businesses to flourish. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplifying entry procedures into bankruptcy by removing the court process when it is not needed, saving individuals, Government and businesses time and money. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protecting individuals, by providing guidance and a legal defence, from committing the criminal cartel offence. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/enterprise-bill/latest-updates/"&gt;Read the details of the amendments in full.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister, Jo Swinson, said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Clearing away barriers to help businesses grow and invest is an essential part of the Government’s plan for growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill will help strengthen the business environment and boost confidence, by sweeping away needless bureaucracy and out-of-date rules.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amendments also contains reforms to planning consents for listed buildings, making the process more straight forward, and to equalities measures, including removing employer liability for third party harassment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Freedom Day for Business as Red Tape Stripped Back</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Oct 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reforms are part of a wider strategy to cut red tape, including the Red Tape Challenge, which invited the public, business and the voluntary sector to give their views on which regulations should stay, be improved, or be scrapped altogether. Today dozens of regulations will be removed or simplified, giving businesses more freedom to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes to regulations include:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing regulatory burdens from hundreds of venues including pubs and clubs, making it easier for them to stage live music. Live unamplified music performed in any location, and live amplified music in on-licensed premises and workplaces for audiences of up to 200 people will no longer need a specific licence between 8am and 11pm. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giving over 100,000 more small businesses the flexibility to decide whether or not their company accounts should be audited, saving firms up to £390m per year. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater freedom for firms to determine the most appropriate set of accounting rules for them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removing legislation that dictates the precise location and design of no smoking signs in workplaces.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Targeted new measures to restrict cowboy clampers saving motorists about £55 million each year in clamping charges &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes to the Money Laundering Regulations to reduce the regulatory burden while strengthening the overall anti-money laundering regime, saving firms around £3 million a year. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower legal costs will help entrepreneurs protect their intellectual property (IP) rights. A new small claims track has been introduced to the Patents County Court (PCC) to make it cheaper and easier for companies to pursue basic IP disputes.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From today businesses are freed from the red tape that holds them back. We are ending over-the-top bureaucracy that stifles community groups and pubs wanting to put on small events; scrapping pointless rules about no smoking signs, and saving businesses millions per year through more proportionate accounting rules.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But this is just the start - we’ve set ourselves the challenging target of scrapping or reducing a total of 3,000 regulations. I’m determined to slim down regulation and make Britain an easier place to start and run a business.”   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Business minister unlocks new business potential</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 Sep 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenger businesses to be freed from red tape &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Sep/minister-unlocks-business-potential#mentors"&gt;22,000 business mentors now accessible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Sep/minister-unlocks-business-potential#support"&gt;Extra money to help entrepreneurs, including women in business, find the right mentor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the MADE entrepreneur festival in Sheffield, Business and Enterprise Minister Michael Fallon announced that there will be new independent scrutiny of the rules and regulations that are barriers to growth for challenger businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are innovative enterprises that do not follow established ways of business working, and which might be held back by burdensome bureaucracy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Fallon said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Challenger businesses create wealth and jobs - we should champion them at every opportunity. They put new products on our shelves, innovate our service industry and create new markets using the latest technology. I don’t want these pioneers falling foul of outdated regulations.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am now looking in more depth at the rules and regulations that are holding back our most forward-thinking entrepreneurs. That’s why in addition to the package of proposals I’m publishing today, I am also strengthening the role of the independent Regulatory Policy Committee to make sure that regulation barriers to challenger businesses growth are removed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experimental &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge work&lt;/a&gt; uncovered a wide range of issues - not all purely regulatory, but relevant to this theme. Key proposals are to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new independent role to champion deregulation for innovative businesses &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage a self regulating approach in the peer-to-peer finance industry by increasing membership of their finance associations and building on their consumer code of practice &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help knowledge-based businesses to secure finance by working with banking and accountancy experts to improve existing guidance and raise awareness of the Government schemes which can help &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify ways to drive down costs in applying for and defending patents, including examining the operation of the US ‘small entity’ regime &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it cheaper and simpler for SMEs to challenge potential infringements of their trade marks &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a better balance to the rights of consumers and online traders by implementing a new Consumer Rights Directive to replace the existing distance selling regulations &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amend the Estate Agents Act (1979) to take out of its scope intermediaries such as private sale portals, which only advertise properties and provide a means for sellers and buyers to communicate with each other.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the report: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/enterprise/docs/r/12-984-removing-red-tape-for-challenger-businesses.pdf"&gt;Removing red tape for challenger businesses (PDF, 284 Kb) &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister also announced Northamptonshire as the “most enterprising place in Britain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="business-mentors-now-accessible"&gt;22,000 business mentors now accessible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Fallon also gave an added boost to entrepreneurs by announcing that a network of 22,000 mentors is now accessible on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.mentorsme.co.uk/"&gt;Mentorsme website&lt;/a&gt;. He added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Business mentors play a vital role in helping SMEs to build their knowledge base as the support comes from someone who has been there and done it before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is great that we now have a vast network of accessible business mentors but we want to grow that number even further and give greater choice to our entrepreneurs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="extra-money-to-help-entrepreneurs-including-women-in-business-access-more-support"&gt;Extra money to help entrepreneurs, including women in business, access more support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that entrepreneurs, particularly women in business, are aware that this support is available, Culture Secretary Maria Miller has today announced that £100,000 will be invested to help them find the right mentor to help their business prosper. This will bring the total government investment in the mentoring programme to £1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Fallon will be making the announcements at the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.madefestival.com/"&gt;MADE entrepreneur festival&lt;/a&gt; in Sheffield. There he will meet young entrepreneurs and take part in the Intuit 100-up session, where young business people will be matched up with volunteer business mentors, trained through the Get Mentoring initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New proposals to streamline employment law</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;14 Sep 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s package comes in response to calls from business to simplify and speed up the process of ending the employment relationship when it breaks down, for the benefit of both employers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has given details of: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its support for settlement agreements to help end employment relationships in a fair and consensual way. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consultation on how best to make this work in practice starts today and Acas has agreed to provide a new code of practice. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How it might reduce the cap on compensation for unfair dismissal claims. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposals to streamline employment tribunals by making it easier for judges to dismiss weak cases &lt;br&gt;
responses to its call for evidence on the TUPE rules, when staff transfer to a new employer. Government has heard that businesses want this to be more efficient, and will consult on specific proposals before the end of the year. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recommendations on how to improve guidance for small businesses on the Acas code of practice on discipline and grievance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have been looking across the range of employment laws with a view to making it easier for firms to hire staff while protecting basic labour rights.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our starting point is that Britain already has very flexible labour markets. That is why well over one million new private sector jobs have been created in the last two years, even when the economy has been flatlining.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we acknowledge that more can be done to help small companies by reducing the burden of employment tribunals, which we are reforming, and moving to less confrontational dispute resolutions through settlement agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government also &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/d/12-1143-dismissal-for-micro-businesses-response.pdf"&gt;responded formally to the call for evidence on proposals for compensated no fault dismissal for micro-firms.&lt;/a&gt; Based on the evidence presented by business the Government will not be taking forward the proposal.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a lightly regulated, flexible labour market that the OECD considers to be amongst the best in the world, behind only USA and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report cited the flexibility of the UK’s labour market as one of the main reasons for its improvement in the global rankings to 8th from 10th.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Government has committed to look at ways to make it more responsive to businesses through a parliament long review of employment law, in conjunction with the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; on employment law, with the aim of clearing away unnecessary and complex regulation that has damaged flexibility, created perverse incentives, increased business risk and unnecessary administration. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Red tape blitz to boost business growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 Sep 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;From April 2013, the Government intends to introduce binding new rules on both the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive and on local authorities, that will exempt hundreds of thousands of businesses from burdensome health &amp;amp; safety inspections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future, businesses will only be inspected if they are operating in high risk areas, such as construction, or if they have a poor record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government will also change the law next month so companies will only be liable for civil damages in health and safety cases if they can be shown to have acted negligently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will end the current situation where businesses can automatically be liable for damages even if they were not actually negligent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commitment constitutes the most ambitious action ever proposed by a modern British government to slash the burden of regulation and set businesses free. It will save British companies millions of pounds in wasted time and money, and help spur economic growth and innovation across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are delivering a number of reforms across the economy to deliver on our top priority - strong and sustainable growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Removing unnecessary red tape and putting common sense back into areas like health and safety will reduce fears and costs for businesses. We want to help give British business the confidence it needs to create more jobs and support the wider economy to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is also taking radical action on red tape in a further measure to boost growth and jobs in the economy. It is systematically examining some 6,500 substantive regulations that it inherited through the Red Tape Challenge process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government is now committing to abolish or substantially reduce at least 3,000 of these regulations and it will complete the identification of the regulations to be scrapped or overhauled by December 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Minister Michael Fallon said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cutting red tape shows the Government is serious about helping businesses to flourish. We’re getting out of the way by bringing common sense back to health and safety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And we will be holding departments’ feet to the fire to ensure all unnecessary red tape is cut, and we can boost the jobs and growth that our economy needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focusing on enforcement of regulation in pubs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Jul 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next six weeks, we want to hear how the way regulations relating to pubs are enforced can be improved, reduced or done differently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiences with regulators might include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with paperwork &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inspections &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;advice from regulators you come into contact with   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign allows comments to be posted anonymously.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pubs are the beating heart of our communities. They are essential for people to relax and enjoy the company of their friends in villages, towns and cities all over the UK. But pubs are businesses too and, as enterprises, they can be held back by poor enforcement of regulation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dealing with the way rules for pubs are enforced can sometimes be more of a problem than the red tape itself. That’s why I’m urging anyone involved in running a pub, particularly a community pub, to visit the Focus on Enforcement website and let us know your views so that we can consider and take any necessary action.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know there are examples of good practice too, so we also want you to tell us on the website about the people who give really good advice and support. This is your chance to make a real difference to the way regulations are enforced.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Focus on Enforcement website, for the first time, also provides details on national regulators in one place and on regulatory functions carried out by local authorities.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volunteer to make a difference to the way regulations are enforced</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement"&gt;Focus on Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; campaign, government is encouraging anyone involved in volunteering to arrange events - from arranging a jumble sale, to organising a Jubilee party - to share their experiences of dealing with local authorities and other regulators. For the next six weeks, we want to hear how the way regulations are enforced can be improved, reduced or done differently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiences with regulators might include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with paperwork &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;advice from regulators you come into contact with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign allows comments to be posted anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Volunteers are the unsung heroes of communities in this country. But dealing with the way rules are enforced enforcement of rules can sometimes be more of a problem than the red tape itself - no one volunteers to be a bureaucrat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So, whether it’s an inspection by someone who won’t listen or having to fill in the same form twice - we want to hear about it. I urge you to go to the Focus on Enforcement website and let us know your views so that we can take action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know there are good regulators out there, so we also want you to tell us on the website about the heroes - people who give really good guidance and help your event to happen well and safely” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the third in a series of regulatory reviews. Businesses in food and chemicals manufacturing can still comment on regulatory experiences within their sectors, while we are also looking for suggestions for future reviews. The best suggestions will guide Ministers in prioritising future reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;9 May 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/your-experiences-of-dealing-with-regulators/"&gt;second review for the government’s Focus on Enforcement campaign&lt;/a&gt; is now up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next six weeks, businesses involved in chemicals manufacturing and storage can share their experiences of working with national regulators and local authorities. Your experience with regulators might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with paperwork &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;inspections &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;advice from regulators you come into contact with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to hear how the way regulations are enforced can be improved, reduced or done differently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Mark Prisk Minister welcomed the launch of the new review and said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This will give businesses in the chemicals sector the chance to make a real difference to the way compliance and protection is achieved on COMAH sites, shaping how companies can best work with regulators in a successful and cost-effective way.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want companies in this area of business, and those that advise and assist them, to visit the website, to tell us their views and suggest how we might reduce enforcement burdens and share best practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is your chance to make a real difference to the way these regulations are enforced.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses in other sectors continue to have the chance to make a real difference to the way regulators do their work in their area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in a different business sector and would like to suggest we look at how enforcement in your area of business could be improved, you can also share your ideas, and the best suggestions will guide ministers in prioritising future reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

It focuses on how enforcement of regulation can be improved, reduced or done differently.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next five weeks, small businesses in food manufacturing are invited to share their experiences of working with national regulators and local authorities. This can include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with paperwork. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inspections. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Focus on Enforcement gives small businesses in food manufacturing the chance to make a real difference to the way regulators visit, inspect and advise and enforce the law.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want all small businesses involved in food manufacture, and those that advise and assist them, to visit the site and tell us their views.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses in other sectors also have the chance to make a real difference to the way regulators do their work in their area.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in a different business sector and would like to suggest we look at how enforcement in your area of business could be improved, you can also share your ideas, and the best suggestions will guide ministers in prioritising future reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Improving Trading Standards to protect consumers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation seeks to modernise consumer law by consolidating and simplifying officers’ investigatory powers set out in around 60 scattered pieces of consumer law into a single set. This will ensure that powers are transparent for both business and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals also aims to reduce burdens on business, by ensuring that officers’ routine visits are pre-arranged unless there are compelling reasons for them to be unannounced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They follow the Government’s agenda to simplify consumer law in response to the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement/"&gt;Focus on Enforcement,&lt;/a&gt; which aims to improve transparency and practice within national and local regulatory functions, including Trading Standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Minister Norman Lamb said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK has one of the best consumer protection regimes in the world but because the current law has developed piecemeal over many decades, it is fragmented and overly complex, making it hard for consumers and business to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Trading Standards officers’ enforcement powers are a prime example of this and we need a major simplification of the law to make it easier for them to tackle rogue traders and protect consumers nationally as well as at a local level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ron Gainsford, Chief Executive of the Trading Standards Institute said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At this time of great economic pressure on local authorities, it is vital that Trading Standards are able to tackle rogue traders as simply, quickly and cost effectively as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome a consultation that seeks to consolidate and simplify the investigatory powers used by Trading Standards and believe it is vital that all stakeholders contribute examples of best practice and evidence any concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS also welcomed the publication today of a joint report by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission on &lt;a rel="external" href="http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/publications/Consumer-redress.htm"&gt;Strengthening consumer redress against misleading and aggressive practices&lt;/a&gt;. It would give consumers subjected to aggressive practices a right of redress, including a right to cancel the contract for a fixed period of 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS will consult further on proposals to simplify other consumer rights later in 2012 for a new Consumer Bill of Rights to comprehensively update consumer law and scrap or reform some 12 pieces of existing legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focus on Enforcement</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable has today launched the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/focusonenforcement"&gt;Focus on Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It asks business to tell Government where enforcement can be improved, reduced or done differently. It aims to discover and celebrate where enforcement works well, so others can learn from it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government will then pick up the best ideas for change, and look swiftly at how it can improve the experience of regulatory enforcement in those business areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This Government has an absolute commitment to clearing away the barriers that act as a brake on growth for British SMEs. That is why, for example, we are not just reviewing whether there is still a case for each regulation, but now we are going to tackle how regulations are actually enforced as well. That commitment to lighten the load lies at the heart of our strategy for achieving economic transformation and recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Government knows that ill thought-out regulations cost businesses time and money - which is why it devised the Red Tape Challenge. But sometimes the regulations are fine, it is inconsistent, inappropriate or overlapping enforcement that is the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Focus on Enforcement gives all businesses, but especially smaller and medium sized firms that often feel the disproportionate weight of inspection and compliance, the chance to make a real difference to the way regulators visit, inspect and advise business and enforce the law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="section"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="improving-enforcement"&gt;Improving enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Budget announced the first three reviews, covering: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chemicals &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;small businesses in food manufacturing &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;volunteer events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can say what experiences you’ve had, good and bad, how regulatory enforcement operates in these sectors, and how it could be improved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government also wants your ideas for future reviews - suggest areas of enforcement you would like to scrutinise in a future review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return the Government will: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use your feedback to help choose the next topics reviewed &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provide at-a-glance information on national and local regulators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;report back on what was found and what action will be taken as a result. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="section-1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Backing small businesses to grow</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable has set out the practical steps Government is taking to help SMEs by boosting business investment and cutting red tape. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The £125 million &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.innovateuk.org/content/competition/advance-notice-advanced-manufacturing-supply-chain.ashx"&gt;Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which will open for applications from 29 March.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2012/Mar/focus-on-enforcement"&gt;‘Focus on Enforcement’ campaign&lt;/a&gt; to identify where inappropriate or excessive enforcement of regulation is holding companies back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This Government has an absolute commitment to clearing away the barriers that act as a brake on growth for British SMEs.

That commitment to lighten the load lies at the heart of our strategy for achieving economic transformation and recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition the Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative will help build manufacturing capacity and ensure that more of the necessary components can be sourced in this country. We will support projects that deliver economic growth, greater competitiveness and safeguard or generate jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will also increase the supply of capital through non-bank lending channels via our £100m SME focused Business Finance Partnership, targeting finance channels other than loan funds.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>British Chambers of Commerce Annual Conference speech 15 March 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon. I’m grateful for this opportunity to speak to the British Chambers of Commerce and its many members. I value the strong and honest relationship that we enjoy: one fully maintained with John Longworth as your CEO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say you have played a critical role over the past year, working extensively with the government as we have got on with our core task of implementing a new economic strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One centred on boosting rates of private investment, increasing exports to growing markets in Asia and beyond, and encouraging start-ups throughout the country. You are providing valuable help to UKTI up and down the country to encourage inward investment, and are vital partners in our Business in You campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, it is visits to local chambers that tell me what business conditions are really like, rather then how they appear from Westminster. I am sometimes accused, for example, of being somewhat OTT in my criticisms of banks; this is at least in part the result of talking to Chambers across the country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BCC’s frankness and insight have been invaluable, if at times rather bracing, and I am grateful for it. In particular, you have kept the government on its toes over efforts to hack through the thicket of red tape and bureaucracy that we inherited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I concentrated on the deregulation agenda when I spoke at this conference a year ago, and I would like to do so again today, outlining the progress we have made and where we intend to go next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain where I am coming from. I am not a believer in laissez faire. Government has a useful role in promoting innovation, training, better infrastructure and creating a framework of rules and standards which business needs to function. Thanks to a Whitehall mole my views on the need for an active industrial strategy are well known (and actually what a lot of business leaders say). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also believe that heavy-handed interventions from government - reaching for the statute book every time a new policy issue arises - have a negative effect on enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say all regulation is harmful. It isn’t. Carefully calibrated consistent interventions can help markets function better, give certainty to business, and confidence to consumers. But I do believe that an unthinking rush to regulate has been the default position in Whitehall for too long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="red-tape-challenge-and-oioo"&gt;Red tape challenge and OIOO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Tape Challenge, which I launched at this conference last year, has begun the process of drastically reducing the number of regulations affecting business to a more sensible level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are systematically working our way through all of them, organising the regulations by theme and publishing them on the website, so companies can tell us which ones are causing problems. Which ones are out of date. Which are out of all proportion with their original purpose. Which ones are just outlandish and need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have examined 16 themes and announced plans for five - retail; manufacturing; hospitality, food and drink; road transport; and employment law. I am pleased to report that of the 1,200 rules examined so far, well over 50% are being scrapped, consolidated or simplified. The first of these decisions were implemented in October last year, with more to follow in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the Red Tape Challenge, we are, for example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;completely overhauling the entertainment licensing system to help small venues;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rationalising food labelling regulations - down from 31 to 17;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and bringing together 12 separate items of consumer legislation into one streamlined consumer bill of rights. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will shortly be announcing the results of the environmental theme in the Budget, which will simplify the requirements business must meet while maintaining essential protections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken individually, these may seem like small steps. Yes, they are. But that is how the burden built up - in small steps. The BCC has always been clear that it is the cumulative burden than is unbearable, and removing that burden will also take many small steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside these efforts to clear the welter of regulations already on the statute book - and more importantly - we are also changing the prevailing culture of government, which has historically viewed regulation as the easy option rather than the last resort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The One In, One Out rule - the first of its kind anywhere in the world - has begun to turn back the tide since it took effect in January 2011. Under its provisions, a minister who wants to introduce a new rule which generates costs for business must first identify a corresponding cut in regulation elsewhere with the same value. The process is designed to force departments to exhaust all the alternatives before seeking to legislate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to tell you that most of my ministerial colleagues regard One In One Out as an absolute pain; every time they bring forward a new regulation there is a big hurdle to cross. There will normally be a wounded-sounding letter saying “I am 100% with you on fighting regulation. But you surely didn’t mean me? My regulations are good!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So cultures do not change overnight. And proving progress to you will not be easy - after all, it is hard to show you what we stopped. But this simple yet revolutionary principle will enable us to cap and, over time, cut the costs of regulation borne by business - especially small business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is backed by a commitment to publish regular progress reports. The latest such report, the third Statement of New Regulation, was published just over a fortnight ago. It shows that the volume of deregulation far outweighs measures introduced - in the first six months of this year the government will introduce 19 deregulatory measures, generating net savings of over £16 million for business. It also shows that, since the introduction of the One In, One Out regime, it has delivered a net reduction in regulation costs for business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any successful attempt to cut back on red tape and bureaucracy must take account of the fact that a substantial proportion of the burden emanates from Brussels. Our first step was to end the gold-plating of new European Union directives. We are now looking at how to scrape off the accumulated gold plate of recent decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we want to tackle the issue at its roots we have to be much more active and engaged with the EU, and at a much earlier stage in the process. That means building alliances with other likeminded member states, so we speak with a louder voice and are better able to protect the interests of UK businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had some success in winning over a growing number of Member States to the view that reducing the overall burden of EU regulation is critical for the continent’s long-term growth prospects. Italy’s recent shift in favour of deregulation is a very welcome development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alliance-building has started to yield real results. In November we secured from the Commission a presumption that micro-businesses will be exempt from future EU legislation, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary. Alongside that was a commitment to examine current and forthcoming EU legislation to identify areas where SMEs could be subject to a light-touch regime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the UK’s persistent lobbying has finally delivered an exemption for micro-businesses from EU accounting rules - benefiting around 1.2 million UK SMEs and saving small firms across the EU up to €3.5 billion each year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, following UK lobbying, a new impact assessment unit is to be set up within the European Parliament to quantify the costs of its amendments to legislation. This should foster greater awareness among MEPs of the cost implications of their proposals and encourage more responsible decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where EU rules have proved most contentious is in relation to employment law. So let me make it clear that I am completely committed to fighting hard against intrusive and unnecessary burdens coming from EU that are damaging to Britain, with the working time directive as an obvious example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will delay and obstruct bad EU regulation using every means at our disposal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can’t blame the EU for everything, convenient as that would be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="employment-law"&gt;Employment law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of employment law, there are undoubtedly problems that have been created in Westminster rather than Brussels, and we have been striving over the past year to unblock them in a systematic way, where the evidence is compelling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading certain newspapers you could be forgiven for believing that nothing was happening or that government was rent by ideological conflict on this issue. Nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great deal of work is taking place to reform employment law. This is all set out in the report that I’m publishing today on our Parliament-long review of employment law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are right to proceed carefully, because uniquely in this area, employment law affects millions of employees - themselves a huge part of the economy. Acting clumsily might have serious consequences for certainty and confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this work has focused on overhauling employment tribunals which, for many businesses, have proved to be bureaucratic, time-consuming and costly - even when tribunals ultimately find in their favour. The fear of a tribunal has a particularly chilling effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large companies will, in most cases, have a specialist HR team which can deal with any cases that arise. Small firms do not have that luxury, so a tribunal means valuable days lost from getting on with the day job of building the business. The average tribunal claim costs £4,000 and takes 24 weeks to resolve: small wonder that some employers settle rather than contest the claim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And large numbers of employers are finding themselves caught up in the system - over 200,000 claims a year, on latest figures. It’s time to reform and streamline the regulatory framework that governs them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first set out our plans to tackle the issue in the government’s formal response to the Resolving Workplace Disputes late last year. The overriding objective is to cut the number of disputes going to tribunals each year - and cut the associated costs for business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, from next month, the qualifying period for the right to claim unfair dismissal will double from one to two years. The legislation was debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday. This will encourage employers to recruit new staff, and allow more time for these new relationships to take root. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will legislate so all claimants have to submit their complaint to ACAS, ensuring the two sides have the option of resolving their differences through conciliation before they can go to a tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even where conciliation doesn’t succeed, it should be possible in many cases to reach a settlement without a tribunal. So we are taking steps to simplify compromise agreements, which enable the parties to reach a no-fault deal in exchange for a guarantee not to bring future claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, some complaints will not be resolved through negotiation, and in these cases we are looking to improve the current system. Work is underway to develop a ‘Rapid Resolution’ scheme as a quicker and cheaper process for straightforward matters, and we will consult on our proposals in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also substantial scope for improving the bureaucratic and expensive tribunals system. I have asked Mr Justice Underhill to undertake a root-and-branch review of the rules governing employment tribunals, in order to modernise them and ensure we have a system that supports business expansion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have moved towards introducing fees for individuals who wish to take their employer to a tribunal, consulting on two options. They will not be a barrier to justice for those with a genuine claim. But fees will encourage potential claimants to think carefully about the validity of their case - leading to more realistic expectations for individuals and greater certainty for employers, and getting the users of the system to bear some of the costs. That consultation has closed and the Ministry of Justice is considering the responses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these reforms are tackling the unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy; the excessive costs; and the time wasted on lengthy employment tribunals. Our governing principle has been to do away with the perverse incentives that can dissuade responsible employers from hiring new staff, for fear of what may ensue if it doesn’t work out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some suggestions that it’s too difficult in the UK to deal with under performing employees, and that this is a barrier to effective workforce management. Small companies, which don’t have in-house legal or HR expertise, may be particularly affected. It is sometimes said that if it was made easier for small firms to fire there would be more hiring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are obvious risks for millions of good, conscientious employees and denting job security at a time when the economy and consumer confidence remain fragile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have launched a call for evidence on where the balance of the argument lies: whether dismissal might be made simpler, quicker and clearer; but without weakening the confidence and security of employees. We are also seeking views on the concept of ‘compensated no-fault dismissal’ for businesses with fewer than 10 employees. But let me stress that no decisions have been made to go down that path: we would only do so if there is strong and credible evidence to justify it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to remember, in the politically heated debates around dismissal, that on almost every measure Britain has one of the Western world’s most flexible labour markets. That is how many firms managed to get through the financial crisis and recession. And compared with France, or even Germany, our laws are very accommodating to employers. We have put out the Employers Charter to remind managers of the rights and flexibilities they enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progress we are making on all these fronts - the Red Tape Challenge; the One In One Out regime; stemming the flow of EU legislation; overhauling the employment law framework - adds up to a co-ordinated plan of action designed to change the regulatory culture within government and seriously to cut back on red tape. The Coalition Government is working together to deliver this agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cutting the burden and costs of regulation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to Politeia for this opportunity to speak about Government’s approach to deregulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a subject which has the capacity to bore, in general, yet excite in the specific. Everyone has a daft red tape story yet getting the media to focus on the overall pitch is very difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is compounded by the delay between Whitehall, Westminster and the real world of business. What we do in policy making, rarely impacts for at least a year. So our work over the last 18 months has not yet been felt, but I am confident it will start to be noticed as 2012 progresses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We inherited a regulatory regime which was creating the equivalent of 6 new regulations every working day: 30 every week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we took the view that simply scrapping say 100 regulations wouldn’t make any difference. Instead, we have taken the brave decision to challenge the very central culture of routine regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means seeking to make legislation the last resort, when seeking to address business issues. It means tackling the flow of new regulations by making the process more difficult and alternatives easier. It means making a concerted effort across the whole of Whitehall to cut the 11,000 existing regulations which affect business. And it means tackling the EU machine, in Brussels, and here in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in my remarks today, I’d like to address the flow of new regulation; the stock of existing rules; help for SMEs; EU regulation; and our work in enforcement, to end the tick box culture of many of the UK’s regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="flow"&gt;Flow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stem the tide of new regulation, we adopted a strategy that had never been tried before - what we call a ‘one in, one out’ regime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if a minister wants to introduce a new rule, they first have to identify a corresponding cut in regulation elsewhere. The aim is to encourage ministers and their departments to look for alternatives, before seeking to legislate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple principle will allow us to first cap and then cut the cost burden of regulation to business, especially small business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our first full year, 2011, the cumulative savings to business reached £3.4 billion. This sum is made principally of one large measure, but beneath this we are already seeing a reduction in the volume of new regulations. Thus, in the second half of last year just 9 new measures posing a cost to business were introduced, against 25 measures which are deregulatory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we shall publish the third Statement of New Regulation for the first 6 months of 2012. Now I mustn’t give too much away before we report to Parliament, but I can tell you that we are continuing to make good progress: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There has been a further reduction in the costs of red tape to business. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The volume of deregulation far outweighs new measures introduced. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Among the small number of new measures coming into force, the largest (in terms of cost to business) is the reform of the Air Travel Organisers’ Licence (Atol) scheme - a change supported by, ABTA, the main travel industry body. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In addition to reducing the flow, we are also increasing predictability for business. We are committed to publishing our regulatory plans earlier, so companies can plan for them with confidence. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So, in our first year, we can honestly say that instead of 6 new regulations every working day, we’ve seen just 19 regulatory measures, across the entire year.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="stock"&gt;Stock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second important strand of our work is to reduce the stock of regulation already on the statute book - through the Red Tape Challenge.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are systematically working our way through the 11,000 rules and regulations that affect businesses - asking companies to tell us which ones should stay, and which go and which overhauled.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to say that we have already signed off plans for around 1,200 of them, with over 600 being scrapped or substantially improved. These changes will be implemented over the coming year or so. Some examples - we have: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;already repealed 98 Trading with the Enemy regulations which are long out of date; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;completely overhauled entertainment licensing especially to help small venues;   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consolidating 12 different types of consumer legislation into one streamlined Consumer Bill of Rights;   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reforming employment tribunals, saving businesses over £40m per annum; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, rationalising food labelling regulations - down to 17 from 31.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Red Tape Challenge, other Government Ministers have instituted important deregulatory measures which we’ve been able to influence. For example, the National Planning Policy Framework, where 1000 pages of guidance are being streamlined. And Health &amp;amp; Safety, where up to one million sole traders who pose no risk to others are being freed from the provisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="smes"&gt;SMEs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMEs are most affected of all by regulation, especially by legislation designed for larger enterprises. That’s why we introduced a moratorium on new regulations for micro businesses (those with fewer than 10 people); for example, from the tobacco display ban. And why they are exempt from pensions auto enrolment until 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also why we scrapped the Right to Request Time to Train - saving SMEs £380 million. &lt;br&gt;
And won exemption for micro businesses from the European Union’s accounting rules, saving them up to £300m per annum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="eu"&gt;EU&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course a policy that seeks to tackle regulation must recognise that around 50% emanates from Brussels. That’s why we are taking a similar comprehensive approach to tackling the issue both here and in each EU institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begins with a clear commitment to end the routine gold-plating of EU rules, which became all too common across Whitehall. In future, we will merely copy EU directives into domestic legislation. No embellishments unless it’s in our interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that alone is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers are actively engaging much earlier in the process, so we can better influence the outcome and protect the interests of UK businesses.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also why I worked with British and German MEPs to secure agreement for a new unit to be set up within the European Parliament. At last, the cost of late amendments to legislation will be known and this will help businesses counter unnecessary interference. I’m very grateful to Malcolm Harbour MEP for his help.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we have secured a presumption that micro-businesses are exempt from future EU directives, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concessions are largely in part thanks to the personal leadership the Prime Minister has shown in the European Council on this issue. And he is continuing his efforts, with a powerful letter just last week to President van Rompuy urging decisive action to cut regulation under a comprehensive EU growth plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="enforcement"&gt;Enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, turning to the regulators. Alongside efforts to cut back on red tape, we also need to improve the way that rules are enforced, to keep costs to a minimum and work with, not against, the grain of businesses that are already compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are extending the Primary Authority Scheme so more businesses can benefit from a consistent common sense approach to local enforcement. Almost 1500 partnerships covering 47,000 premises (and more than 450 businesses) with over 1.2 million employees are already benefitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are ending the tick-box inspection culture - the emphasis must be on achieving the desired result rather than adhering to rigid procedures; questioning whether ensuring compliance should always involve the state, or whether there’s scope to build on some of the already-successful business-led models of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are going to review the impact of front-line inspection and enforcement on business, looking from the perspective of the user across different sectors, focusing not just on the national enforcement bodies but also local regulation, identifying overlaps and weeding out whatever becomes clear is unnecessary.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have pledged to include a sunset clause in the founding legislation of any new regulatory body, should it be necessary to set one up in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms I have outlined are more than just a piecemeal attempt to cut excessive, redundant or ineffectual rules and red tape - it is a comprehensive plan of action designed to change the very culture of Whitehall, so that regulation becomes the last resort, and not the first option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we recognise that there is very much more to do. There has been a generation of policy-making founded on the belief that regulation, and legislation, are the default answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t change overnight - but we are determined to pursue this issue remorselessly, so we free up enterprise in Britain to grow and prosper for the benefit of us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Apprenticeships boost for business</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable has announced new measures to ensure more young people benefit from an apprenticeship, and to help employers gain the skilled workers they need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Government’s &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//policies/growth"&gt;plan for growth&lt;/a&gt;, Ministers are taking action to make it easier for companies to take on apprentices, and ensure that the quality of apprenticeships is continually improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vince Cable was speaking alongside Skills Minister John Hayes at a summit for business leaders in London, stating that the government would slash the red tape that can deter hard pressed firms from recruiting apprentices, and provide a financial incentive of up to £1,500 to help the smallest firms recruit their first young apprentices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Apprenticeships are proven to boost the life chances of young people, and are a sound investment in our future competitiveness. So when times are tough, it’s right that we provide additional support to help the smallest firms meet training costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll cut no corners on quality. Apprenticeships will remain the gold standard for excellence in vocational training - but where red tape serves no purpose, we’ll strip it away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review into the quality of apprenticeships will be undertaken by a leading employer, reporting in spring 2012, to help ensure the highest standards in apprenticeships. Apprenticeship providers will also be required to offer training in English and Maths up to the standard of a good GCSE (level 2) for all apprenticeships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="new-measures-to-boost-apprenticeships"&gt;New measures to boost apprenticeships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To encourage thousands of small firms that don’t currently hire apprentices to take on a young apprentice aged 16 to 24, the Government will offer employers with up to 50 employees an incentive payment of up to £1,500. This will support up to 20,000 new apprenticeships in 2012/13. An initial payment will be made two months after the individual has started their apprenticeship; the balance will be paid after the apprenticeship has been completed and the trainee has progressed into sustainable employment. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Processes will be simplified to make it quicker and easier for employers to take on an apprentice. The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/About-Us/National-Apprenticeship-Service.aspx"&gt;National Apprenticeships Service&lt;/a&gt; and training providers will be required to ensure that every employer is in a position to advertise a vacancy within one month of deciding to take on an apprentice. Health and safety requirements will be streamlined so that there are no additional demands on employers that already meet national standards. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There will be a renewed focus on targeting the programme where apprenticeships deliver greatest value - including on younger adults, new employees, higher level qualifications and particular sectors where they can make the greatest impact. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apprenticeship providers will be required to offer training in English and Maths up to the standard of a good GCSE (level 2) for all apprenticeships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>New measures announced to boost British business</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron announced the the business growth package at the ‘Exporting for Growth’ and Fitness Finance conference that will benefit hundreds of small businesses. They include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk//news/topstories/2011/Nov/regional-growth-fund-to-help-small-businesses"&gt;£95 million investment from the Regional Growth Fund.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Web Fuelled Business initiative, helping businesses exploit the potential of the internet. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The National Export Challenge, opening up new markets around the world. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Finance Fitness campaign, providing the support small businesses need to access finance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the Exporting for Growth and Finance Fitness event live [link expired]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“British SMEs are already doing incredible things, but we urgently need more of them to follow that boldness. We need this to be a country where more people think ‘I can start my own business and I can sell to the world.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our determination is to come through these difficult times stronger, to trade our way to growth and jobs. We need to show real optimism about the future, and we need to show real aggression about pursuing Britain’s interests in the world. The markets are there to be tapped; the deals are there to be done, the opportunities are there to be capitalised on. Now together we must seize them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the Prime Minister’s speech&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-business-growth-package"&gt;The business growth package&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£95 million of new Regional Growth Fund money has been allocated for SMEs who can’t access commercial funding. This is being directed to small businesses through RBS, Natwest and HSBC - and it is expected to unlock a further £500 million of investment. The fund uses the high street banks to provide finance for SMEs seeking to purchase assets and create employment, which are unable to secure commercial funding for their project. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From April 1st ‘one-click registration’ will go live, so that businesses can get online, register their business at Companies House, sign up for PAYE registration, Corporation Tax and Self Assessment all in one place. The ability to register for VAT will be added shortly after. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching the Web Fuelled Business initiative - the Department for Business is teaming up with founding Dragons’ Den panellist Doug Richard and Yell to get 3,500 businesses into workshops all over the country to ensure they are able to exploit the global opportunities offered by the internet. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching the National Export Challenge; a series of initiatives to give SMEs the knowledge they need to make the first steps to breaking into new markets. The national challenge will get business intermediaries to provide sector knowledge and support for SMEs. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching the ‘Open to Export’ web resource providing small businesses with professional export advice, hosted by Yell to allow UK firms to swap information and experiences directly. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launching a new campaign promoting different sources of finance to SMEs and giving them the tools and advice to access the finance they need, including advice and best-practice guidance for SMEs and a new Finance Finder tool on the BusinessLink website. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new UKTI prize for the best export idea. This prize will run regionally and nationally. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new “how to” export guide which professional services companies can use with their own branding to issue in branches, to memberships and customers. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Promoting British business to the many journalists and international business people passing through London during the Olympic Games by establishing the new British Business Embassy, based at Lancaster House. It is estimated this will achieve £700m in export sales as a result of games-time activity. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To support the growth of businesses in Tech City the Prime Minister announced the expansion of the Red Tape Challenge so that entrepreneurs and investors can tell the Government where rules and regulations get in the way of innovation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today, not only are we able to announce substantial new measures to support businesses, but also to see the commitment of private sector firms and organisations to tackling the economic challenges we face. We want to reach and help the 80 per cent of SMEs who don’t seek external advice before applying for finance.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The small firms of today are Britain’s international success stories of our future and it is this success that will build the strong, balanced economy that will secure our economic prosperity.”&lt;/p&gt;
