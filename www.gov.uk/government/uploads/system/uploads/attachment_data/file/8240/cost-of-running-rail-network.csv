Notes:,,
These data are based on each operator’s statutory accounts. Any figures relating to premia or associated payments to the Department for Transport or Passenger Transport Executives are excluded.,,
"For each operator, the latest available statutory accounts have been used. The periods covered by each set of accounts do not always match. Because of this, it is not appropriate to sum up each item to derive a total cost.",,
"Although we have aimed to be as consistent as possible, operators may not treat all aspects of operating costs in the same way in their accounts, and so care should be taken when using these figures.",,
"The Allocated Network Grant for each train operator is calculated by taking the total Network Grant in 2010-11, and allocating it to each franchise based on their share of Fixed Track Access Charges.",,

The operating costs relate to the year ended (unless stated otherwise the accounts relate to a full year or nearly a full year):,,
(1) 31 December 2010,,
(2) 31 March 2011,,
(3) 30 April 2011,,
(4) 31 March 2010
(5) 3 July 2010
(6) 8 January 2011
"(7) Southern's accounts relate to 20 September 2009 - 3 July 2010, and so do not cover a full year"
