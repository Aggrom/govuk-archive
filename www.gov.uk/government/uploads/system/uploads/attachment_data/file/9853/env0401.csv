2. UK national emissions estimates are updated annually and any developments in  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Last updated: 13 February 2012,,,,
    methodology are applied retrospectively to earlier years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Next update: March 2013,,,,
3. The figures in this table are 'by source' which means that they include direct emissions ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    and do not include emissions resulting from the production of the fuels used.,
4. International aviation and international shipping emissions are not included in the national ,
"    total reported to the UNFCCC, since there is no internationally agreed way of allocating ",
    these emissions to individual nation states.,
