Current Technical Definition,"The MOD's primary contribution is to contribute towards the ISAF-led operational campaign in Afghanistan where the UK provides the second largest contingent of forces (after the US). Indicators could be measured by the numbers of Afghan National Security Forices (ANSF) trained by the international ISAF coalition (against agreed targets) to seek to achieve the Governments national security objective of establishing a stable and secure Afghanistan. Working closely with FCO, DFID and the international community, the MOD is engaged in building the Afghan capability for security, in particular through the provision of UK troops for training, partnering and mentoring of Afghan National Security Forces. Detailed descriptions of progress, supported by a range of qualitative and quantitative assessments, will be provided in monthly reports to Parliament. ","Total number of personnel deployed e.g. 250 deployed on several tasks throughout the year e.g. floods, foot and mouth etc.",Total number of attaches and advisors deployed and number of locations covered e.g. 250 deployed covering 22 countries,Number of Service and MOD Civilian Personnel deployed on all operations in a year - Weekly total for year divided by 52 to provide the average for the year.,Number of Force Elements against the total number showing weakness. Force elements reported are Frigates and Destroyers; Brigades; Fast Jets (Tornados and Typhoon) and Military Helicopters,"Net Slippage across all Category A-C Equipment projects (in months), that have passed Main Gate Approval. Category A-C projects are defined as those with a capital value greater than £20M that have passed their main investment decision (""Main Gate"")",Number of SP who are classed as 'Medically Fully Deployable' or 'Medically Limited Deployable' as a proportion of Trainied Strength,"Percentage change in Operational Pinch points (OPPs); - a branch sepcialisation, sub-specialisation or area of expertise, where the shortfall in Trained Strength (Officers or ratings/Other Ranks) is such that it has a detrimental impact on operational effectiveness.",Percentage of Service Personnel (split by Officers and Other Ranks) who are satisfied with Service life in general,Overall public favourability of the UK Armed Forces
Rationale,"Afghanistan is MOD's Main Effort as set out in the Departmental Business Plan. It should be noted, however, that UK activity in Afghanistan is part of the wider ISAF contribution and therefore should not be seen as having sole responsibility for delivering this objective.",Military aid to civil agencies is an important task for the Department.,Defence Diplomacy is a priority as defined in the Departmental Business Plan.,Overall commitment of Armed Forces and civilian personnel.,Overview of Readiness to meet contignet tasks.,Effectiveness of MOD equipment acquisition process.,Ability of Armed Forces to meet contigent commitment.,Ability of Armed Forces to meet critical tasks.,Armed Forces Covenant.,Public Support for military is key to operational success.
Current Formula,,Total number of personnel deployed.,Total numbers of Attaches and Advisors deployed and number of locations covered.,"Number of Service and MOD Civilian Personnel deployed on all operations in a year- Weekly total for year, divided by 52 to provide average for the year.","Number of Force Elements against total number showing weakness. Worked Example: Defence attributes 27 Force Elements against Strategy for Defence priorities. Out of these, 8 are reporting critical or seriouis weakness which represents 29.6%.","Net Slippage across all Category A-C Equipment projects (in months). DE&S KPIs Worked Example: Total net slippage of 13 months, reported in-year against 43 projects. This equates to average in-year slippage of 0.33 months per project.",Medically Fully Deployable (MFD) + Medically Limited Deployable (MLD) divided by Total Service Personnel.,Percentage change in top three OPPs for each Service.,The Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey (AFCAS) is a tri-Service attitude Survey distributed annually to Service Personnel. It captures data related to Terms and Conditions of Service to facilitate personnel policy decision-making.,From External Polling Survey.
