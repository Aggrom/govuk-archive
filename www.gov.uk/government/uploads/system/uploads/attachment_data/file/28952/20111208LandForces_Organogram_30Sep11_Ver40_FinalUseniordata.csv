"1225305","N/D","OF-6","Commander Germany Support Group","The Germany Support Group delivers Firm Base support to some 40,000 British service personnel and their dependants based in Germany . Its outputs are analogous to those of a UK based regional brigade in that it delivers the full range of personnel, logistic, equipment, training and infrastructure support to its dependency. Unlike a regional brigade, it acts as in lieu of a UK local authority by fulfilling a range of statutory obligations such health, education, customs & excise and the safeguarding of children, but has no responsibility for recruiting, TA & cadets or UK resilience. The key outcome is to ensure the deployability of 1 (UK) Armd Div and Theatre Troops on expeditionary operations.","Ministry of Defence","Ministry of Defence","Land Forces","01264 886108","LF-Sec-Group@mod.uk","1167888","N/D","1.00","N/D","","","Military","","1"
