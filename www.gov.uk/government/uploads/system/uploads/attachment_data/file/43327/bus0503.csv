"1. Net government support comprises Public Transport Support, Bus Service Operators Grant and Concessionary Travel Reimbursement.",,,,,
"The last of these is not a subsidy to the bus industry, as bus operators are reimbursed for carrying concessionary passengers on a",,,,,
"no better off, no worse off' basis. All of these represent revenue funding - capital expenditure relating to bus services is excluded. For full",,,,,
"data source descriptions, please see the footnotes to table BUS0502.",,,,,
2. Adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator (as at 27 September 2012).,,,,,
"3. Within this table, funding support is apportioned equally across all passenger journeys made (including fare-paying journeys on commercial ",,,,,
"services), whether or not the passenger was a direct beneficiary of the support in question.",,,,
See table bus0502 for further details of what is included as Concessionary Travel.,,,,
4. London runs an entirely tendered market and therefore some comparisons with the rest of country should be treated with care.,,,,
"5. Until 2009/10 figures in this table for public transport support, and concessionary travel outside London, were on a Financial Reporting",,,,
Standard 17 (FRS17)basis.  For 2009/10 they are on a non-FRS17 basis. For 2010/11 onwards they are on a non-International Accounting,,,,
Standard 19 (IAS19) basis.,,,,
"6. The 2009/10 figures contain an additional element of spending, RECS, which for other years is included only in capital charges",,,,
and therefore excluded from current expenditure (as shown here).  This may affect comparisons with previous or following years.,,,,
R Minor revisions have been made to earlier years data.,,,,
P We are expecting a revision to the 2011/12 “public transport support” figure in one metropolitan transport authority. The revised figure is ,,,,
"not yet available so, as an interim step, we have used  an estimate for this authority based on published budget data.",,,,
