"[1] Staff should not accept a gift unless it is a trivial item (an inexpensive pen, calendar, diary etc) or refusing it would cause embarrassment or offence to the donor (eg a gift offered as part of an inter-governmental visit).  Staff may keep a trivial gift but may not keep any other gift without the agreement of their SCS line manager – and they may then be required to purchase this in the same way as Ministers.  All non-trivial gifts are to be recorded’",,,,
