"BIS Diversity declaration rates have appeared low since the merger of former departments BERR and DIUS systems.  In 2010 a BIS code of practice on the collection and use of diversity monitoring data was introduced.  Over the summer of 2010, an awareness campaign to encourage staff to check and update their diversity data on line was carried out through posters in all locations, news stories and weekly bulletin board.  Super Users were available in all directorates to give desk side assistance and the Chairs of the Diversity Networks gave their support to answer any concerns staff might have.  Workforce Diversity data  is used to help check  HR policies and processes for any equality impact. ",,,,
