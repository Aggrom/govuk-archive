" Learning and Development 

In 2010 - 2011,  22 different courses were delivered centrally  e.g. as Performance Management (mandatory for managers); Managing Vacancies (mandatory for all people advertising vacancies); Management skills (for all managers); Leadership and Management.  Equality and diversity considerations are embedded throughout the L & D programme. In addition to the core training offered in BIS, each business directorate within our organisation provides learning and development opportunities within their area, to meet specific demands.
