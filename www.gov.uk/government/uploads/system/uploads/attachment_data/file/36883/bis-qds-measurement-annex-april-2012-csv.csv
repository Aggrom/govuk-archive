Innovation: an innovation is a new or significantly improved product (good or service) introduced to the market or the introduction within an enterprise of a new or significantly improved process. Innovations are based on the results of new technological developments, new combinations of existing technology or the utilisation of other knowledge acquired by the enterprise. Innovations may be developed by the innovating enterprise or by another enterprise. However, purely selling innovations wholly produced and developed by other enterprises is not included as an innovation activity. Innovations should be new to the enterprise concerned.

Unknown grades should be apportioned across the grades as necessary so that underlying numbers align with the number of FTE payroll staff supplied above. Where underlying numbers are not consistent, departments should provide an explanatory note in their meta-data sheet.
