"Provisional Data
The information contained in this report is provisional and based on unverified claims made by suppliers. It should be viewed as indicative rather than definitive. Verified data is published annually and can be found on the the DfT website, http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/series/biofuels/.  Those using this document should be aware that while in the majority of cases there is little discrepancy between a company’s provisional and verified data, in some instances the difference has been significant. For further information on provisional data please see the notes at the end of this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Executive Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
This report covers the supply of biofuels under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation¹ from 15 April 2011 to 14 December 2011.  The headline figures2 are:,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.4 billion litres of biofuel have been supplied under the RTFO in the first 44 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the first eight months of the 2011/12 obligation period, 983 million litres of biofuel have been supplied, which is approximately 3.2% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation percentage (""specified amount"") of 4.0%3. More biodiesel (56%) has been supplied than bioethanol (44%).  There has also been a small volume of biogas declared to us.",,,,,,,,,,,,
The feedstock is known for 98% of fuel supplied. Both the feedstock and country of origin are known for 94%.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The largest proportion of biofuel came from the feedstock, used cooking oil (489m litres, 50% of total biofuel supplied).  The most widely reported feedstock from a single country of origin for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the Netherlands (153m litres, 28% of biodiesel supplied). The most widely reported feedstock and country of bioethanol was non-European Community corn from the United States of America (336m litres, 77% of bioethanol supplied).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the period, 53%4 of biofuels met an environmental standard5.",,,,,,,,,,,,
The majority of feedstock has been imported; 12% of the biofuel was reported as coming from UK feedstocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,
93% of the fuel reported as coming from UK feedstocks met environmental sustainability standards.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Greenhouse gas savings of 62% were achieved.  This figure may not include all emissions from direct land use change and excludes the emissions from indirect land-use changes considered in the 'Gallagher Review'. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. The RTFO applies to road transport across the whole of the UK. Refiners, importers and any others who supply more than 450,000 litres of relevant hydrocarbon oil for road transport annually to the UK market are obligated by it. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Data come from monthly reports submitted by fuel suppliers to the RTFO Administrator. The RTFO Administrator performs checks on the data, which for suppliers of over 450,000 litres of biofuel, are also subject to an annual verification process by independent auditors. The RTFO Administrator will publish a final, fully verified dataset after the end of each obligation year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The RTFO Administrator publishes reports that identify the carbon and sustainability performance of individual companies.  This is the first report on the progress in year four and reports on the period to which the pre-RED guidance applies.  Archive reports are available on our website at: http://dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/biofuels/data/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Obligated suppliers can meet their volume obligation by surrendering the appropriate number of RTFCs to the RTFO Administrator and/or by paying into a buy-out fund. The RTFCs can be obtained by supplying their own biofuels or by purchasing RTFCs from other biofuel suppliers. A quarter of their obligation can be met by surplus RTFCs from the previous obligation year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Under the RTFO Order, these reports must not contain information from which the volumes of fuel being reported by individual suppliers might be derived. To protect the volumes of individual suppliers in some reports, certain quantities of fuel reported as meeting the Qualifying Standard or RTFO Meta-Standard have been removed from the overall RTFO figures. In this report, all fuel meeting the Qualifying Standard or Meta-Standard has been included in the overall RTFO figures, but some has still been excluded from the reporting by feedstock and country. The figures by country and feedstock do not therefore tally exactly with the overall figures.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. The ability of suppliers to source certifiably sustainable fuels is currently limited by the lack of operational sustainability standards for several feedstock/country combinations. Certified sustainable feedstock is expected to become increasingly available over time, as feedstock standards develop in response to the demand created by the RTFO and growing concern about the sustainability of agricultural commodities more widely. Suppliers can arrange their own audits against the RTFO Meta-Standard. There is more than enough RSPO certified palm oil to meet the entire UK demand for palm oil biodiesel feedstock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RTFO report for the pre-RED implementation part of Year 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Provisional data for the 2011/12 obligation year to date,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes on data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To encourage the sourcing of sustainable biofuels, the RTFO Administrator requires fuel suppliers claiming Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates to submit monthly reports on the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) saving and the sustainability of the biofuels they supply.",,,,

Reporting is also seen by the Government as an essential 'stepping stone' towards a mandatory assurance scheme. The EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) includes mandatory sustainability requirements. The RED was transposed into UK law in December 2011 and all RTFO data publications on fuel supplied on or after 15/12/11 will report against the RED sustainability criteria.,,,,

"This report provides information on the carbon and sustainability performance of renewable fuels supplied under the RTFO. The data are derived from the monthly reports on biofuels provided by individual fuel suppliers. At the end of the reporting year1 fuel suppliers are required to provide an independent verifier's opinion2 on their information, and this verified information will be published.",,,,

The carbon and sustainability data cover the direct impacts arising from biofuel cultivation. The RTFO Administrator separately monitors the potential indirect impacts of biofuel production such as indirect land-use change or changes to food and other commodity prices (e.g. The Gallagher Review of the indirect effects of biofuels production which was published on 8 July 2008). ,,,,

Sustainability and the RTFO Meta-Standard,,,,
,,,,
"The RTFO is built around seven sustainability principles; five environmental and two social. These seven principles have been used to define the RTFO Sustainability Meta-Standard. A meta-standard approach enables existing schemes, such as the UK’s Assured Combinable Crops Scheme (ACCS), to be assessed against the RTFO principles.",,,,

No schemes currently meet all of the environmental and social principles; although two schemes meet both of the social principles. Suppliers are also permitted to set up their own auditing procedures to demonstrate that feedstocks meet the RTFO Meta-Standard: two suppliers have developed interpretations of the RTFO Meta-Standard which cover Brazilian sugar cane and cereal crops. ,,,,
,,,,
"Any scheme that meets an adequate number of the RTFO Meta-Standard criteria is considered a ‘qualifying standard’, and fuel companies can report these to the RTFO Administrator. Fuels from wastes (e.g. used cooking oil and tallow3) are automatically considered to meet the qualifying level. ",,,,
,,,,
"Other standards can also be reported to the RTFO Administrator and count towards the data capture target; these include standards that have not yet been benchmarked against the RTFO Meta-Standard, or standards that have been benchmarked, but do not meet sufficient criteria to be awarded the qualifying level status.",,,,
,,,,
"While there are currently several qualifying standards for the RTFO, these are mostly either under development or only newly established; the ACCS is the only well established certification scheme, and is only applicable to UK crops. This currently limits the ability of fuel suppliers to source certifiably sustainable feedstocks4. The market is developing, and suppliers have been putting in place procedures to track information about sustainability through their supply chains and others have been performing their own audits against the Meta-Standard. It is intended that by creating a market for sustainable crops, the RTFO will support the development and expansion of these certification schemes, and that suppliers will be able to source their feedstocks increasingly sustainably.",,,,
Content of RTFO reports,,,,
,,,,
RTFO reports include information on:,,,,
" - volumes of fuel by fuel type (e.g. biodiesel, bioethanol);",,,,
" - volumes of fuel by feedstock (e.g. used cooking oil, soy);",,,,
" - volumes of fuel by country of origin (e.g. UK, Brazil);",,,,
 - volumes of fuel meeting sustainability standards;,,,,
 - lifecycle greenhouse gas savings of fuels.,,,,
,,,,
RTFO summary data,,,,
Table 1 reports on the overall performance of data received from companies against three key indicators of sustainability,,,,
"Tables 2 to 8 provide summaries of all the road transport biofuel supplied to the UK for each fuel type, feedstock, country of origin, and previous land-use.",,,,
Table 9 and 10 look into the data capture and accuracy of data collected,,,,
,,,,
RTFO trends,,,,
Table 11 presents data on RTFO performance over time.,,,,

RTFO detailed data,,,,
"Table 12 provides more detailed data broken down by fuel type, feedstock, country of origin and previous land-use. So, for example, data are provided on the volumes of fuel and the C&S information of bioethanol from Brazilian sugar cane, or biodiesel obtained from oilseed rape grown in the UK on cropland, and also meeting a Qualifying Standard.",,,,

RTFO reports also include additional information on:,,,,
 - company performance against key indicators of sustainability;,,,,
 - trades of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) between companies.,,,,
,,,,
Company data,,,,
Table 13 provides data on company C&S performance. ,,,,
,,,,
RTFCs,,,,
Contains data on trades of certificates between companies over time.,,,,

Provisional data,,,,
"These data are based on information submitted monthly to the RTFO Administrator by fuel suppliers. If we have reason to believe that a piece of data may have been misreported we will challenge companies to check and if necessary revise their data. Where this process is ongoing, our reports are based on the data exactly as reported to us. The final verification2 of these data occur annually (by 28 September 2012 for Year 4 of the RTFO).",,,,

Each RTFO Report released by the RTFO Administrator will contain data from the reporting year1 to date on biofuels entering the UK market from those companies that are registered with the RTFO Administrator.,,,,

"The exact timing of the months that the data covers is different for major and minor fuel suppliers, due to the way they report data on volumes of fuel to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC): ",,,,
 - Large fuel companies (typically fossil fuel suppliers) report to HMRC on a 15th to 14th of the month basis.,,,,
 - Smaller fuel companies (typically biofuel suppliers) report by calendar month or quarter.,,,,
,,,,
Note that the data in this report are provisional and unverified and may change following publication.  It is your responsibility to check you have the latest version - please check our website for updates,,,,

RTFO report for the pre-RED implementation part of Year 4,,,,
Provisional data for the 2011/12 obligation year to date,,,,
Glossary,,,,
,,,,
Obligated company,,,,
" - An obligated company is one that supplies > 450,000 litres/year of relevant hydrocarbon oil road transport fuel.",,,,
 - Obligated companies supply > 99% of the biofuels in the UK market.,,,,
 - Obligated suppliers must:,,,,
      - supply biofuels; or,,,,
      - purchase certificates from other companies supplying biofuels; or,,,,
      - pay into a buy-out fund; or,,,,
      - a combination of any of the above.,,,,

Non-obligated company,,,,
" - Non-obligated companies are those that either supply < 450,000 litres/year of relevant hydrocarbon oil road transport fuel, or only supply biofuels.",,,,
" - Non-obligated companies are not required to register with us, but can choose to do so and earn one Renewable Transport Fuel Certificate (RTFC) for every litre of biofuel supplied.",,,,

Sustainability standards,,,,
 - Sustainability assurance schemes are divided into Environmental and Social Standards and these are split into three levels:,,,,
1. RTFO Meta-Standard (RTFO) - this is a higher standard than most existing sustainability standards and covers seven key environmental and social principles.,,,,
2. Qualifying Standards (QS) - meet the majority of the environmental and/or social criteria defined under the RTFO Meta-Standard.,,,,
"3. Other Standards - these have either not yet been benchmarked, or have been benchmarked against the RTFO Meta-Standard, but do not meet sufficient criteria to be awarded QS status.",,,,
" - None/unknown should be reported where the feedstock was not certified against a standard, or the data is unavailable.",,,,
" - Suppliers can report a Benchmarked or Qualifying Standard and conduct supplementary audits to meet a QS or the RTFO Meta-Standard, respectively.",,,,
 - Suppliers producing biofuels from by-products have little or no control over how the source feedstocks were produced.  Biofuels from by-products are automatically credited to the Qualifying Standard.,,,,
Previous land-use,,,,
 - This is the use of the land on which the feedstock crop was grown prior to 1 Jan 2008. There are sixteen categories:,,,,
 1. by-products;,,,,
 2. cropland - protection status unknown;,,,,
 3. cropland - non protected;,,,,
 4. cropland - protected;,,,,
 5. cropland - protected - no change in status,,,,
 6. degraded land;,,,,
 7. forest >30%;,,,,
 8. forest >30% no change in status;,,,,
 9. forest 10-30%;,,,,
 10. forest 10-30% no change in status;,,,,
 11. grassland (and other wooded land not classified as forest) with agricultural land;,,,,
      12. grassland (and other wooded land not classified as forest) without agricultural land;,,,,
 13. undrained peatland;,,,,
 14. undrained peatland - no change in status;,,,,
 15. wetland;,,,,
 16. wetland - no change in status;,,,,
 17. settlement,,,,
 18. unknown,,,,
 - By-products (e.g. used cooking oil and tallow) do not require any additional land.,,,,
 - The previous land-use affects greenhouse gas emissions due to release of carbon stored in the soil and plants when the land is cleared and ploughed up for biofuel crops.,,,,
Carbon intensity,,,,
 - Carbon intensity is a measure of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the fuel chain from 'field-to-wheel'.,,,,
 - Different GHGs have different potencies (some make a greater contribution to global warming than others).,,,,
" - To account for this, all GHGs are expressed in terms of their strength relative to carbon dioxide, called carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).",,,,
Greenhouse gas emissions,,,,
" - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of different biofuels can vary significantly depending on the system of cultivation, processing, and transportation of feedstock.",,,,
" - The data collected takes into account GHG emissions of the fuel chain from 'field to wheel' incorporating data on feedstock, country of origin and land-use change.",,,,
 - GHG saving refers to the reduction in GHG emissions due to replacing fossil fuels with biofuels. A negative value means that more GHGs have been emitted by using the biofuel than if the fossil fuel was used.,,,,
Accuracy level,,,,
 - Accuracy level is a measure of the amount of data provided by the supplier on a particular batch of biofuels.,,,,
 - This data is used for calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions of the fuel chain.,,,,
 - It ranges from 0 to 7 where 7 is the highest:,,,,

Level 0 - Fuel default,,,,
Level 1 - Feedstock default,,,,
Level 2 - Process default,,,
"Level 3 - Actual data for transport, drying and storage, fuel depot or filling station",,,
Level 4 - Actual data for process module,,,
Level 5 - NUTS2 or other regional cultivation emissions,,,
Level 6 - Actual ‘collected’ cultivation data,,,
Level 7 - Actual data provided for the entire fuel chain,,,
,,,
Data Capture,,,
 - Data capture refers to the amount of data provided by transport fuel suppliers against the four sustainability components (as opposed to reporting 'unknown' ): ,,,
1. biofuel feedstock,,,
2. feedstock country of origin,,,
3. sustainability standard,,,
4. land-use on 23 January 2008,,,
" - Whilst 'unknown' reporting is permitted, suppliers are encouraged to identify and report accurate information about the feedstocks used. Where 'unknown' or 'none' is reported this does not count towards the data capture target.",,,
" - Where a by-product has been used as the feedstock, reporting 'by-product' for the sustainability information fields is counted as a completed report.",,,
 - Reporting a non-Qualifying Standard is also counted as a completed data field for the 'standard' field.,,,
