    <title>Asian Fire Service Association (AFSA) Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to be invited to speak here today and to see so many others here to support you. I understand that this is the fifth AFSA national conference, and my predecessor Bob Neill has spoken at the last 2. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Bob, who has a deep understanding of the issues you face, as well as a great knowledge of the sector. I know that Bob, when he was Fire Minister, greatly valued the close and positive relationship he had with AFSA. I very much hope to be able to continue that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-afsa"&gt;The importance of AFSA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of groups such as AFSA cannot be underestimated. You provide a forum for people to come together to discuss key concerns, to support each other’s development, and provide an opportunity for challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in terms of challenge, AFSA continues to perform a vital role in terms of ensuring that equality, diversity and fairness are mainstreamed in the Fire and Rescue Service. Events such as this provide excellent opportunities for the exchange of ideas, and for lively debate. I know that a regional AFSA group has been set up here in the West Midlands, supporting professional development and progression, sharing learning experiences, building a solid network of mutual support for employees, and supporting charities and fundraising. All of this shows the excellent work that the association is doing both at the national and local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="promoting-equality-and-diversity"&gt;Promoting equality and diversity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Sir Graham Meldrum, when he was Chief Fire Officer in the West Midlands and again as Chief Inspector of Her Majesty’s Fire Service Inspectorate did a great amount of work to promote equality and diversity in the service, and this excellent work has been carried on by Vij as Chief Fire Officer of the West Midlands, and in his presidency of the Chief Fire Officers Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would like to say, on a personal note, that I am deeply committed to advancing equality of opportunity to one and all, not only in the fire and rescue service, but also in the communities they live in and serve. I am also of the firm conviction that this is best driven locally. And I say this because I want each fire and rescue authority to be responsible for reaching out to minority groups, and ensuring that they recognise that the service is for them - not as an add on - but for them along with everyone else in the community. I want fire and rescue services to go out into their communities, find the right people, engage with them and draw them into the heart of the fire and rescue service family. I want the entire community to be so integrated into the fire and rescue service that we no longer have to think in terms of equality and diversity - it will just happen automatically. I know that this is at the core of what AFSA is working for, and you have my full support in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt, a lot is already happening, and I would like to highlight some of the work going on here in the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service. They have Welcome to the West Midlands, an education programme for new migrants to promote safety, well being, community understanding and citizenship. This has been developed in consultation with migrants to meet the information gap which can occur when someone arrives in this country. The West Midlands also has active employee engagement through the local AFSA group, working with them to target under represented operational and support staff to develop essential skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my short time as Fire Minister I have been very impressed by the wide range of local initiatives such as these, which not only reach out to the under represented, but also to the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Greater Manchester, the fire service is leading a community project with the Asian Development Association of Bury. This project, which provided employment opportunities for local people, has already seen the production of a fire safety video that can be heard in eight of Manchester’s most commonly used languages. It will be the main communication tool used in community education sessions, facilitated by fire and rescue service volunteers recruited by the association. There will also be a series of workshops for the &lt;abbr title="Black and minority ethnic"&gt;BME&lt;/abbr&gt; business community designed to raise awareness of how the fire and rescue service can help them meet their responsibilities under the Fire Safety Order. This project will be rolled out across all of Manchester’s ten metropolitan boroughs in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To engage young people from a community they have previously found hard to reach, and to respect religious beliefs, they have established a cadet scheme in Hyde for young women from the Bangladeshi community, and they are hoping to use this as a model to engage many ethnic communities in similar activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is being driven forward at the local level - not by central target or quotas, but by responding to the demands of their local communities. And to be able to respond to these, each fire and rescue service needs to make full use of the human resources at their disposal - and to do this equality and diversity has to be at the core of any organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to delivering the best service to the local community is to have a diverse, representative workforce, equipped to understand and meet the needs of those it serves and capable of delivering a first class service to everyone. This will also support the service’s aim to create a better understanding of its preventative role and of the support and advice it is able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire service must ensure that every employee is valued; that there truly is equality of opportunity for all, and that the working culture is such that unfair discrimination, unacceptable behaviour, bullying and harassment are not tolerated. I strongly believe that the fire and rescue service has gone a long way to achieve this goal and together with partners like AFSA they can continue to work to create an even more open and inclusive service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fire-kills"&gt;Fire Kills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also like to take this opportunity to thank AFSA for your continued support of the Fire Kills campaign. The Fire Kills campaign has had a focus on &lt;abbr title="Black and minority ethnic"&gt;BME&lt;/abbr&gt; groups since 2005 - and for good reason. Research has shown that certain &lt;abbr title="Black and minority ethnic"&gt;BME&lt;/abbr&gt; communities are at a potentially greater risk from fire. Smoke alarm ownership amongst Asian communities is ten per cent lower than the national average.  Recent analysis of accidental dwelling fire victim profiles has suggested that Asian communities are potentially more vulnerable than African communities. This has led to our 2012 campaign focussing solely on the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities. With smoke alarm ownership levels lower in these communities the primary message will be on the importance of working smoke alarms. Two bursts of advertising will run - one which began this week, and another in March 2013. The new campaign will focus on blessings. As you know blessing of wellbeing, health and a long life are delivered on important occasions in these communities. The new campaign will encourage people to make their blessings count - ‘when you give a blessing, make it count: test your smoke alarm’. There will be radio advertising to demonstrate the fire consequences of not having a working smoke alarm, linking it back to a blessing that was given. I have no doubt that this campaign, targeted primarily at first generation Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, will be a powerful tool for you and all those in fire and rescue services seeking to reduce deaths and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-position"&gt;Economic position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of this conference is ‘advancing equality during austerity’. I think that it is important to note that there are signs of improvement in the economy. Jobs are being created, manufacturing and exports have grown as a share of our economy, our trade with vibrant, emerging economies such as China and Brazil is improving, and the world is once again investing in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we face many challenges. The debts built up over many years will take time to work our way through, not helped by a decline in our competitiveness which was effectively masked by unsustainable borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made, and reductions applied to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been heartened to hear how many fire and rescue authorities have risen to the challenges that the spending review has posed. However, I know some of you have concerns that fire and rescue services may disproportionately reduce funding on equality and diversity activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is not the case. But if you see this happening, then you must speak up. It is vital that fire and rescue services do not make decisions that will impact on their ability to deliver on their statutory duties as required under the Equality Act 2010, and transparency and accountability are at the heart of our approach towards local government generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing I would like to thank you once again for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today. I do hope that your organisation goes from strength to strength, and that you remain and important and influential voice in the British fire and rescue service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to extend my congratulations to all the award winners who will be honoured at this evening’s event, well done, keep up the good work and have a great night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Fire Minister backs call for action on false alarms</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Brandon Lewis has called for more to be done to combat the 250,000 false fire alarms across the country each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the Fire Sector Summit at Wembley on Wednesday, he pointed to new figures showing that, in London alone, a fire engine is called once every 12 minutes to a false alarm, at a cost of £34 million every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, throughout the country, there were nearly a quarter of a million false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to an audience of fire professionals the Minister argued that many of these could be prevented through the use of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end, I have asked the industry to see what can be done to drive down false alarms through improved equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire Sector Federation has set up a group that is already looking at the use of more sophisticated technology such as multi-sensor fire detectors which can detect more than one factor such as smoke and heat. These are much more accurate at identifying whether there is a real fire or whether it is an environmental factor such as dust or steam that is triggering an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, improved procedures can hugely cut the number of false alarms. A well known food processing company reduced its false alarms from nearly 50 a year to less than one by training fire marshals to investigate the cause of an alarm before the fire and rescue authority was called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Mr Lewis went on to say that by working together the sector could find financial savings as well as save lives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At a time when every penny counts, this is an obvious area in which to make large savings. Dealing with the number of false alarms has got to be a priority and I would encourage the industry and fire and rescue authorities to work together to develop a common approach to cutting back on something that not only wastes money, but potentially could cost lives, and I look forward to hearing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/fire-sector-summit-2012"/>
    <title>Fire sector summit 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to say how delighted I am to be invited to speak to this summit - an event that grows in importance every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly pleased that the summit brings together all parts of the fire industry - not only those who deliver the fire and rescue service at the sharp end, but all those who, often behind the scenes, do so much to ensure the buildings we live in and the products we use on a daily basis, are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-success-story"&gt;A success story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in terms of fires you should all congratulate yourselves on a considerable success story. In England, fire fatalities and non-fatal casualties fell by 34% and 54% respectively between 2001 to 2002 and 2011 to 2012, and the average area of fire damage fell by 20% in dwellings and around 10% in other buildings during the same period. Last year, total fires fell by 6% to 227,000. I very much hope that these trends continue way into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of government’s commitment to maintaining a high profile focus on prevention activity, the Fire Kills campaign is currently running its hugely successful national advertising campaign. As with last year, we are encouraging everyone to test their smoke alarms when they change their clocks this weekend as you are four times more likely to die in a fire if you do not have a working smoke alarm. I would ask that in order to extend the reach and breadth of the campaign, you use your own websites to disseminate this important message. By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction between the fire industry and fire and rescue is a complex one - and for that reason I am delighted that the Fire Sector Federation is playing an increasingly important role in pulling all parts of the fire industry together, into a forum where ideas and knowledge can be exchanged. And I would particularly like to thank Brian Robinson, the Chairman of the Federation, for his hard work and perseverance in bringing the Federation to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-importance-of-co-operation"&gt;The importance of co-operation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth is a top priority for this government. Supporting business growth for both new and existing companies is fundamental to our approach. And encouraging the creation of new businesses and sectors is crucial to this country’s future. These new businesses will help to create the necessary wealth and growth, and much needed jobs. But we need also to ensure that both new and existing businesses are strong and resilient, including safeguarding and protecting them from the devastating effects of a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of you here today will know a fire can result in a business loss both in terms of its employees, its contribution to the local economy, and ability to recover and trade again in the aftermath of an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge the fire sector to go out and proactively engage with representative bodies for industry and commerce and make the case for effective and proportionate fire protection - passive and active interventions - in all areas of business in England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="false-alarms"&gt;False alarms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry also has a vitally important role to play in ensuring that we make the best use of innovative technology. You will know better than me the scope for technology to improve resilience to fire - but one area where more can be done is in limiting the number of false alarms. Last year there were 249,000 fire false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London Fire Brigade says that despite a reduction of 23% in false alarms in the last 5 years, a fire engine is still called to a false alarm every 12 minutes in the capital, costing an estimated 34 million every year. More importantly, these unnecessary calls impact on the Brigade’s ability to attend real incidents, deliver training and carry out vital community safety work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that technology can address this issue. To that end I have asked Brian Robinson to see what the industry itself can do to drive down false alarms through improved technology. Brian has asked a Fire Sector Federation working group under Martin Harvey to look into this issue - and I very much look forward to hearing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="workforce-development"&gt;Workforce development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where I see significant improvement is in relation to workforce development in fire and rescue services. Here collaborative working between the Sector Skills Council - Skills for Fire and Rescue, and the Chief Fire Officers Association amongst others - is starting to produce tangible results, especially in the risk critical areas of intervention activity. Such work helps underpin integrated risk management plans, interoperability, national resilience and common working. Much energy is being devoted to this work. I would like to thank Max Hood, the chair of the National Occupational Committee for his efforts in leading this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="public-procurement"&gt;Public procurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you have an interest in public procurement and accessing new markets. This is an area where government is keen to help. As you may know, the government has put in place the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder" title="Contracts Finder"&gt;Contracts Finder&lt;/a&gt; website, aimed at making it easier for suppliers to find and apply for public sector contracts. It is the main source of government opportunities worth more than £10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My department has already approached certain fire and rescue authorities to help populate pipelines and is very grateful for the assistance given to date. We are now asking all fire and rescue authorities for help to get as much information on future procurements in the pipeline - this should not be difficult as fire and rescue authorities should already be publishing this information existing contracts and tenders under the local government transparency code. The information on future procurements will help strengthen the UK supply chain by identifying current gaps between supply and demand and giving industry the confidence to invest for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is also committed to devolving power away from Whitehall so that fire and rescue authorities can decide how they can deliver services in a way that best meets their communities’ needs. I hope that the fire sector can join together to develop new ways of working and further innovation that can stimulate growth for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="youth-employment"&gt;Youth employment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to speak a little about youth employment. In response to the challenge of youth unemployment, year the Deputy Prime Minister has launched a £1 billion Youth Contract to help unemployed people get a job. The Youth Contract will provide a number of new opportunities for young people, including apprenticeships and work experience placements. Many of you will be aware of the The Prince’s Trust Fire Industry Scheme, and some have supported it. I wish to thank you for that, and encourage others to get involved if they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a number of fire and rescue authorities have started training apprentices. I was particularly impressed to hear that in Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service 12 young people have started a community safety apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apprentices are young people who have already had some contact with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, for example through the Prince’s Trust courses, cadets and Fire Fly following a targeted recruitment campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support them through the application process, they put on a 10-day pre-recruitment course - run by Salford City College - to give candidates an understanding of working with people in the communities they would serve, as well as meeting a community safety adviser who is already in the job, so they know exactly what the role entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to commend Greater Manchester for this valuable initiative, and wish the new entrants every possible success in their apprenticeship, and future careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="retained-duty-system-firefighters"&gt;Retained duty system firefighters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the one area where industry and the fire and rescue service co-operate on a daily, if not hourly, basis is in the retained duty system. There is no doubt that the retained duty system is the backbone of the fire and rescue response in large swathes of the United Kingdom. We must, as leaders in the fire sector, wherever possible, bring to people’s attention the valuable work done by retained duty firefighters, and encourage employers and members of the public to offer their services to this essential service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Charred clocks bring an emotional reminder that it’s Time to Test</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire Kills - When you change your clock test your smoke alarm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting campaign offers a timely reminder that changing our clocks isn’t the only important task to carry out over the weekend of 27/28 October - the clear Fire Kills message is that it’s time to take life-saving action and test our smoke alarms too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.communities.gov.uk/images/newsroom/2237695.jpg" alt="Fire Kills poster showing a child"&gt;“Do you swear on your child’s life to test your smoke alarm this weekend?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple task of making sure our smoke alarms work is something that many often forget. But people are more than four times as likely to die in a fire if they do not have a working smoke alarm, so the Fire Kills campaign is using the twice-yearly clock change chore to remind people that it’s time to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images of charred timepieces that bring to mind a child’s bedside table, a grandparents’ mantelpiece, and a quiet night in front of the TV, pull on the heartstrings to remind householders of the lives at stake if their smoke alarm isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011-12, there were 30,709 accidental fires in the home, resulting in 187 fatalities and more than 6,000 injuries. The number of fatalities was 12 per cent lower than in 2010-11 and Fire Kills aims to keep these figures going down because behind every death is a tragic story of loss for family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost half of those people who died in dwelling fires last year were aged 65 and over. This year the campaign is urging carers, family and close neighbours to offer to test older people’s smoke alarms for them as they are often out of easy reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a working smoke alarm can buy people valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999, only half of all householders who own a smoke alarm say that they test it is working on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign aims to make testing our smoke alarms part of every household’s routine when changing our clocks, potentially saving many lives in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The smoke alarm is a proven saviour, and while the great majority of homes now own one, that’s simply not enough - it must be working to save your life.
&amp;gt; “Keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from the worst should never be left to chance. That’s why this campaign reminds us of exactly what’s at stake if the worst should happen.
&amp;gt; “The clock change offers the perfect prompt to carry out the simple task of testing your alarms and offering to test for other people - especially older friends and relatives who may find it difficult to do it for themselves.
&amp;gt; “Last year, nearly one in seven adults tested their alarms over the clock change weekends and we want many more to test this year. A simple task, taking just a few seconds, can mean the difference between life and death, so add it to your ‘to do’ list now. Our message is clear - it’s time to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’re more than four times as likely to die in a fire without a working smoke alarm. But despite this, only half of the people who own an alarm say they take the time to test that it’s working.
&amp;gt; “Almost half the people who die in accidental fires in their home are aged over 65. Let’s reduce this shocking statistic by offering to help older family members or other elderly people we care for and test their alarm for them.
&amp;gt; “A smoke alarm can give you the vital time you need to get out, stay out and call 999 in a house fire. As you put your clocks back on the weekend of 27/28 October take an extra moment to make sure your alarm is working properly - it could save your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen out for the radio adverts…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://web-cdn.coull.biz/communities/MP3Player/MP3Player.swf" alt="embed: "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and look out for the press adverts supporting the ‘When you change your clocks, test your smoke alarms’ campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/8079926013/sizes/l/"&gt;It would have taken only seconds to test their smoke alarm&lt;/a&gt; (external link)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the home by following these simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. Make sure you fit one on every level of your home and test them regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make testing your smoke alarm part of your household routine. Test the alarm by pressing the button regularly; change your battery once a year or invest in a 10-year alarm; and clean the alarm casing twice a year to ensure dust doesn’t block the sensor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatever happens, never remove the battery in your smoke alarm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire and practise your escape route.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want an extra nudge to test your smoke alarm regularly, try setting an automatic reminder. Safelincs, in partnership with the Fire Kills campaign, has created a free service that reminds you, by email or text, when it’s time to test your smoke alarm, change the battery or renew the unit. The service is completely free and can be cancelled at any time.

&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British Summer Time (BST) ends on the last Sunday in October. The clocks go back at 2.00 am BST on 28 October to 1.00 am Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fire statistics can be found on the DCLG website at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/monitorq1q42012"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/monitorq1q42012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research conducted by Ipsos API on the 2011/12 Fire Kills campaign showed that 14 per cent of respondents (total 1690) tested their smoke alarms over the March clock change weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chief Fire Officers Association Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to be here today in my second full week in my new job. I’d like congratulate Vij (Randeniya) on his election as the new CFOA President and thank Lee (Howell) for all his work as part of the presidential team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to put on record my thanks to fire and rescue authorities for the important role they played in torch relays across the United Kingdom and during the Olympic and Paralympics Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the role that fire and rescue authorities played has gone almost unnoticed in the public eye, the effort and resources which were put in place were greatly appreciated across Government. I am pleased that a number of fire and rescue authority staff who made a significant contribution in delivery of services will be receiving recognition in the form of a commemorative medallion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to play tribute to Bob Neill, who I know had a deep understanding of the issues you face, a huge knowledge of the sector, and who worked closely with you on resetting the relationship between central and local government, devolving power and responsibility to the front line professionals, to communities and their local elected representatives - where it rightly sits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased to have been given this brief and I look forward to working with you and your elected members in the coming weeks, months and, hopefully, years. I’m particularly pleased to say that my new brief maintains the link between fire and rescue and local government. Alongside my fire responsibilities I am also local government Minister. This is particularly important to me as I am a keen proponent of local determination on service delivery, on prioritisation and on spending decisions. Keeping the fire and local government link is vital in this and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that I intend to continue Bob’s good work here, embedding localism, continuing the integration of funding via the business rates system, and more importantly, getting out of the way to let you do what you do best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fire-prevention"&gt;Fire prevention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will of course, continue to support you where it is appropriate. Thankfully, the number of fires and associated fatalities and injuries continue to fall. The latest statistics show fire deaths in the home have more than halved in the last twenty years - and fell 12 per cent last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic achievement and the Fire Kills campaign is a great example of how effective a partnership between Government and local fire and rescue authorities can be. The campaign’s annual report for 2011/12 was published last week. It clearly demonstrates the range and impact of fire prevention activity being delivered by both the Department through its media campaign, and by its partners. The outstanding success of this campaign is, as you know, in large part due to the sterling, and often innovative, work undertaken at the local level to embed its fire safety messages with both the general public, and with those who may be especially vulnerable to the risks from fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the commitment of you and your local partners to the prevention agenda saves lives and resources. It ensures that our communities are safer places, less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge must now be to maintain that clear focus on fire prevention, community safety and resilience. Working together allows us to deliver consistent safety messages, tailoring and targeting the campaign to maximise its effectiveness at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month, the Fire Kills campaign will again be running the hugely successful national advertising campaign to encourage everyone to test that their smoke alarms are working when changing their clocks. I’m sure you’ll already be considering how best to support this at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working together we have the opportunity to really drive home the importance of fire safe behaviour and maintain the downward trend on fire deaths. Given its impact, I am committed to maintaining a high profile focus on community fire prevention and safety activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="resilience"&gt;Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevention activity doesn’t just relate to improving fire safety. We have a model for civil contingency delivery that fits with our views of localism: planning and action at local level based on local risks and with partners having local accountability to make your localities more resilient places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know fire and rescue authorities are increasingly providing strategic leadership to local multi-agency emergency planning activity, with Chief Fire Officers chairing four of England’s 38 local resilience forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means fire and rescue authorities working with partners locally to better identify and mitigate complex resilience risks that could disrupt everyday life; including flooding, severe winter weather, disruption to fuel supplies or security threats. I hope, as I’m sure you do, that your role in responding to these types of emergencies is not called upon. But in my role as Minister for fire, resilience and emergencies I am keen to hear more about the good examples of the role of fire and rescue authorities in local multi-agency planning that strengthens our ability to quickly respond and recover from disruptive events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-clear-vision-for-local-delivery-the-national-framework"&gt;A clear vision for local delivery: the national framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very heart of the Government’s ambition is putting power back where it belongs - in communities and with the locally elected councilors who represent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities have been empowered with greater freedoms and flexibilities. You now have general powers of competence and an equivalent general power along with the ability to consult locally to allow charging for additional activities including the option for charging for persistent false reports. These are good examples of central Government stepping back and letting you get on with your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire and Rescue National Framework is currently proceeding through parliament, and will be fully in force in October this year. I’ve come to it new. But I like what I see. For me, it embodies the right approach; setting high level principles instead of detailed requirements - it’s ‘what’ not ‘how’. I am pleased to hear that CFOA has welcomed this document. I would also like to thank you for the support and advice I understand you gave to officials as part of the working group. I think we should all be proud of the Framework, one that moves away from prescription to empowerment, and one that clearly sets out three bold priorities for fire and rescue authorities to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify and assess the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their areas face, make provision for prevention and protection activities and respond to incidents appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be accountable to communities for the service they provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that this includes the business community. I firmly believe that businesses have the right to expect that those enforcing regulatory compliance do so in accordance with the fundamental principles of better regulation. I know that CFOA are keen to address shortcomings in this area and to lead work at the local level to develop fire safety audit and enforcement responsibilities to reflect more closely the aspirations that businesses have. Essentially, this means for helpful, proportionate and consistent advice on compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that economic growth and business support is our number one priority, I commend you for your approach and look forward to a positive progression of this significant tranche of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our national resilience to major fire and rescue related risks remains a priority for government. But we can only do this together, through true partnership, working across all local and national responders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we have put in place the Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board, and it is already bringing key partners together to consider national resilience issues. Of course, government will continue to set the strategic direction, but our approach to national resilience must be based on and drawn from local capability alongside your professional expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can only prepare effectively if we have an approach to resilience based on local expertise and knowledge. Communities rightly expect their local fire and rescue authorities to play their part in keeping the country safe; every major emergency originates as a local emergency and being able to plan effectively for all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether they are of a local, cross-border or national nature, is essential. &lt;br&gt;
In delivering for your communities, you need to engage them - give them a real understanding of the risks being faced and the full range of what you are doing so they can better understand why you make the decisions you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know there are some increasingly tough decisions to be made on how best to allocate prevention, protection and operational resources locally - this needs to be done in a way that meets community aspirations in an open and consultative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By giving communities a voice, you give them a choice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choice to make their views known on whether their priorities are the same as yours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choice to come up with new ideas on service provision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choice to challenge you on these issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going further, we are today launching a  consultation on assurance statements, a mechanism for showing the public how the services they provide are run by their authorities. I know that some of you have mixed feelings on such statements. But for me this is about demonstrating a commitment to greater openness, showing the taxpayer how their money (including council tax) is spent, enabling communities to hold their authorities to account over how they spend the public’s money and for the decisions that they make. And some of you are already doing it very well. Every aspect of council business - including the decisions they make for the delivery of fire and rescue - should be open to public scrutiny including senior pay, councillor expenses and local services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="economic-context"&gt;Economic context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of course mindful of the financial backdrop we all face. We have taken tough decisions necessary to reduce the budget deficit that we inherited from the last administration. Every bit of the public sector needs to do its bit to help, and local government accounts for a quarter of the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value the incredibly important service that fire and rescue authorities deliver for local communities, and the part they play in national resilience. Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made and reductions applied to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will know that we are currently consulting upon plans for 2013-15 funding as part of the business rates retention scheme - this consultation is due to close on the 24th of September and I know that many of you have already engaged in the process. I would urge those whose voices have not yet been heard to ensure they make their views known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that you are anxious to see what funding might look like from 2013, but I’m sure you will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the consultation, nor can I pre-empt the announcements on funding for 2013/14, which I expect to be made in December in the usual way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, or maybe because of them, I know that you as the professional leaders for the fire and rescue sector are making great strides in efficiency. You have well established processes in place to use integrated risk management plans to make strategic and operational decisions on the siting of fire stations, the staffing and equipping of such stations, and hours of operation of each station. You are looking at your own service configuration to delivering services in a new environment. Some of you are looking at how you use your estate, I know for example that Merseyside are working with the police to share headquarters, that partners in the North West and partners in the South are sharing control rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last week I visited my local constituency fire and rescue authority, Norfolk, who updated me on their Combined fire and rescue, police and ambulance station in Sheringham which officially opened in January this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing buildings is also bringing collaboration on other matters, and I am sure that all of you are looking outside your own sector to see how the country’s national emergency services estate could be better used - sharing facilities and back office services. I know that you are increasingly working with the Ambulance Service and that inter-agency collaborations and interoperability are becoming increasingly important. I’m sure there are ways that we can work and share with the Ambulance Service and other partners and not only improve the services we deliver but also become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="engagement"&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, in 2 weeks, you can imagine that I am only just scratching the surface of what your issues are. I have already met with Cllr Kay Hammond, who as you know is the new Chair of the Fire Services Management Committee. I outlined to Cllr Hammond that I want to strengthen my engagement with your elected politicians, and I have made clear that as well as having a more regular engagement with the FSMC, I will want to meet chairs and members of fire and rescue authorities. I know that as the professional leadership of the sector you will want to support your councilors in meetings with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to broaden my engagement with CFOA as the representative body for senior professionals. I will be meeting with your president, vice-president and vice-president elect. After this I want my engagement to be with the Board and the Council - I want to hear a broad range of views, and I will make time to engage with you on a regular basis and intend to get out and about visiting as many of your areas as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cfra"&gt;CFRA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Framework specifically embeds the key role of the post of the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser who provides professional, independent advice both to senior officials and Ministers. The post was first created in 2007 with Sir Ken Knight filling the position since that time. However, earlier this year Ken indicated that, having completed five years, and with the Olympics behind us it was the right time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having served in Fire and Rescue for over 40 years, including positions as Chief Fire Officer of County, Combined and Metropolitan Fire Authorities as well as the Fire Commissioner for London, Ken has provided consistent and professional advice to my predecessors as he continues to give me. I have hugely valued his input in my first weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State and I recognise the value and importance of professional advice within the Department and therefore we will shortly be advertising for Ken’s successor whilst I am delighted that Ken has agreed to remain in post until the appointment is made. I hope that senior professionals will take an interest in the post, seeing it as an opportunity to utilise their knowledge and experience to support officials and Ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be continue to provide opportunities for secondments from the sector to contribute professional views to the development of government policy and give individuals a chance to develop and to experience the workings of government. I hope you will see DCLG as a good place to send your brightest officers as a key part of their career progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be other opportunities to say thank you to Ken but I wanted to place on record the Government’s appreciation for the support and advice he has given through the last challenging five years, and of course the previous 41 years in fire and rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I have given you a clear indication of where my priorities lie. I recognise that there are tough times ahead but I believe fire and rescue authorities and Chief Fire Officers can provide the leadership needed to continue to deliver a trusted and excellent public service. A new and more collaborative national-local relationship provides an opportunity for fire and rescue authorities, and organisations like CFOA, to play an ever stronger part in setting the agenda and in keeping our communities and our nation safe. I look forward to working with you all. Fire and rescue services are hugely respected in the UK and have the ability to reach high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Communities Secretary Eric Pickles responds to the riots 1 year on</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anyone who disrupts the communities and livelihoods of our citizens will face the full force of justice. Since last August the Government has sent the strongest possible signal that mindless criminality will not be tolerated ever. Over 1,900 people were swiftly brought to justice and the average sentence was over four times longer than usual.
&amp;gt; “Government made millions of pounds available to councils to quickly help reopen shops and rebuild communities affected by the riots, and made sure the police continue to build positive relationships with those areas.
&amp;gt; “We are determined to see our young people given the best start in life. We are supporting those most in need via the Youth Contract which will provide support worth almost £1 billion, to young people, including wage incentives for ‘youth unemployment hotspots’ - and are going into the homes of 120,000 of the nation’s most troubled families to address root causes.
&amp;gt; “At this time we must also remember the acts of selfless kindness shown by the many people who stood up and joined the ‘broom brigade’, which were in stark contrast to the reckless criminal minority that perpetrated this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Response to recent misleading press reports on fire statistics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department responds to recent press reports incorrectly suggesting that the numbers of arson attacks are rising, fire deaths are increasing and the number of homes fitted with smoke alarms is falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an incorrect and misleading picture. The latest figures show fire deaths across England were down 12 per cent in 2011-12 compared to the previous year and the number of people with a smoke alarm in their home is at a record high. Official figures also show deliberate fires have fallen in 2011-12. The fire service remains a vital frontline service which the Government is protecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were 116,000 deliberate fires attended by Fire and Rescue Authorities in England in 2011-12. This is one per cent lower than in 2010-11 and 60 per cent lower than ten years ago. &lt;em&gt;Fire Statistics Monitor&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/monitorq1q42012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were 27,200 incidents of arson reported to the Police in England in 2011-12. This is seven per cent lower than in 2010-11 and 55 per cent lower than ten years ago: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/period-ending-march-2012/rft-appendix-tables-2011-12.xls"&gt;www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/crime-stats/crime-statistics/period-ending-march-2012/rft-appendix-tables-2011-12.xls&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accidental dwelling fires fatalities, which account for three fifths of all fire fatalities, were down by 26 from 213 in 2010-11 to 187 in 2011-12 (or 12 per cent): &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/monitorq1q42012"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/monitorq1q42012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latest official figures show smoke alarm ownership is at a record high of 86 per cent up from 8 per cent in 1988: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/firestatsgb201011"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/firestatsgb201011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fire and Rescue National Framework for England published</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Rescue Minister Bob Neill has today published the new Fire and Rescue National Framework for England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Framework recognises the proficiency and experience of fire and rescue authorities and gives them the freedom and flexibility to deliver services to their communities without prescription from Whitehall. It will move accountability away from central government and place power in the hands of local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Bob Neill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Framework delivers on the Government commitment to clearly define national resilience and to set out clear roles and responsibilities. I welcome the opportunity to take a collaborative approach to national resilience that is based on, and drawn from, local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key priorities for fire and rescue authorities in the new framework include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identifying and assessing the full range of foreseeable fire and rescue related risks their area faces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;making provision for prevention and protection activities and responding to incidents appropriately&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working in partnership with their communities and a wide range of partners locally and nationally to deliver their service; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;being accountable to communities for the service they provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Framework enables fire and rescue authorities to efficiently deliver their services against a backdrop of change and the need to cut the national deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition the Framework clearly defines national resilience setting out clear roles and responsibilities as well as setting out arrangements for fire and rescue authorities to collectively engage with government on national resilience issues through a new Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board. The Board will enable a collaborative approach to national resilience that is based on and drawn from local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fire and Rescue National Framework for England was published on Wednesday 11 July 2012 and is available on the Department’s website at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/nationalframework"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/nationalframework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From December 2011 to March 2012 the Draft Fire and Rescue National Framework for England was out for public consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework has an open-ended duration which gives fire and rescue authorities greater certainty with the high level, strategic nature of the Framework meaning that it should remain unchanged for the medium to long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Councils to get 100% help to clear up after floods</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government has set out the help that it is giving to councils following the record breaking rainfall over recent weeks that has had a devastating effect on many parts of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local Government said that they would look sympathetically on councils where they have costs as a result of the floods, and announced that they would reimburse councils for 100 per cent of their clearing-up expenditure under the Bellwin scheme. Councils have a vital role, along with the emergency services, in responding to such events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Government Minister Bob Neill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I know that many households and businesses have been disrupted by the floods that have affected parts of the country. That is why we have announced that we will reimburse councils 100 per cent of their costs under the Bellwin scheme which will help councils clear-up streets removing debris from roads and footpaths, shore up buildings and remove dangerous trees.
&amp;gt; “I am writing to all councils affected to see what practical support they need and the Government is continuing to monitor the situation carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activation of the Bellwin scheme was announced in a Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament by the Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, recording that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is activating the Bellwin Scheme of Emergency Financial Assistance to help local authorities with their immediate costs associated with protecting life and property in their areas. Exceptionally, the scheme will reimburse local authorities for 100 per cent of their eligible costs above threshold. This is in recognition of the particular circumstances around these floods and will give the affected local authorities assurance that such costs will be reimbursed. Government officials will also be discussing the recovery arrangements with local authorities in the areas affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Councils, police, fire and National park authorities are eligible for Bellwin reimbursement when they have spent more than 0.2 per cent of their calculated annual revenue budget on works that have been reported to the Department as eligible for grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has decided that on this occasion it will reimburse 100 per cent of the costs above the threshold, instead of the standard 85 per cent as stated in the Bellwin scheme guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fire Service College sale formally launches</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a period of pre-market engagement, the Department is now commencing the sale process for the Fire Service College and would welcome expressions of interest from potential bidders. This follows the Government’s announcement in March 2012 that to secure the future of the College it intended to dispose of it as a going concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fire Service College is one of the world’s largest operational fire and rescue training centres with a global reputation for excellence. It provides training to the UK Fire and Rescue Service, other emergency services of both the UK and overseas governments and to the global private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Neill, the Minister for Fire and Rescue, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Fire Service College is an asset of national importance, with a world-class reputation and it is vital that we secure its future.
&amp;gt; “This means that the private sector will be able to bring innovation and investment to the College, benefiting taxpayers, local residents, the Fire and Rescue Service and, ultimately, strengthening national resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations should contact the Department of Communities and Local Government to register their interest and to receive details of the process, either by emailing &lt;a href="mailto:FSCfutureoptions@communities.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;FSCfutureoptions@communities.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; or by telephoning Harriet Hepburn on 030 3444 4607.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Minister set out the rationale for selling the College at the Local Government Association Fire Conference on 21 March 2012: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/lgafire2012"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/speeches/newsroom/lgafire2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Securing the future of the Fire Service College</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire and Rescue Minister Bob Neill has today announced the next steps in securing the future of the Fire Service College. Following a successful pre-market engagement exercise, the Fire Service College will be sold to a private sector company to continue operating as a training centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure best value for money for hard-pressed taxpayers and enable the College to continue in its role a number of conditions will be imposed on the proposed sale.  These include commitments that not only will the College be preserved as a national training college for the Fire and Rescue Service but that it will continue to offer wider national resilience and emergency services training and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob Neill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Fire Service College is an asset of national importance, with a world-class reputation and it is vital that we secure its future.
&amp;gt; “My decision means that the private sector will be able to bring innovation and investment to the College, benefiting taxpayers, local residents, the Fire and Rescue Service and, ultimately, strengthening national resilience.
&amp;gt; “I know there is real excitement about this opportunity out there in the market and I look forward to seeing some strong bids when the process opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The Fire Service College is a trading fund and executive agency of the Department for Communities and Local Government. Since becoming a trading fund in 1992, it has never been able to pay a dividend out of operating profits. This situation cannot persist and the Government’s response to Fire Futures on 12 April 2011 concluded that the College could achieve its full potential only if there was greater involvement from other sectors in its ownership, operation and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. The Future Options project considered four options for the future of the College:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The status quo: the College remains as a trading fund of the Department&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Government Owned Contractor Operated model: the assets remain under Government ownership but management of the College is taken over by a private sector company under a long term contract, together with the staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disposal as a going concern: the College is sold to a private sector company who would continue to operate the College as a training centre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Closure: the College’s activities cease, staff are made redundant and the site is sold for an alternative use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the four options showed disposal as a going concern to be the best option. It is the only option which both fully removes from Government the ongoing financial risks of ownership of the College and preserves a national training college for the Fire and Rescue Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. A pre-market engagement exercise has been conducted to invite the views of external partners and to assess the level of private sector interest in the College. There has been real interest in this solution and we expect the College to go to market in early April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local Government Association fire conference 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Draft text of the speech - may differ from the delivered version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to be here today at what is now my third of these events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am honoured to have been able to hold the position of Fire and Rescue Minister for what is now nearly two years. It has given me time to get to know you and understand the challenges you face. I hope to continue this dialogue, particularly with local councillors, to hear about the issues you face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year we have again seen fire and rescue authorities exemplifying all that we rightly value in a public service. We clearly saw just how much we depend on fire and rescue as a high-performing emergency service in the public disorder that we saw on our streets this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fire-prevention"&gt;Fire prevention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the work you do saves lives. Fire and rescue authorities have been hugely successful in ensuring that our communities are safer places less exposed to the destruction and devastation caused by fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know many of you work with the Fire Kills Campaign and I am delighted today to be able to announce that the Fire Kills national campaign has been given approval to continue in 2012/13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this and your wider prevention work, is a vital strand in our in our national fire safety armory - not only regularly reminding the public, through powerful media messages aligned to the forthcoming clock change, of the need to ensure they have a working smoke alarm, but also developing partnerships and working in collaboration with a range of organisations to target safety messages on those who are most vulnerable to the risk of fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, the success of the Fire Kills campaign relies on a close relationship, based on true partnership with fire and rescue authorities, who must take much of the credit for the continuing stability around accidental fire deaths in home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The valuable contribution fire and rescue authorities have made by supporting the campaign at the local level and implementing a raft of prevention and other community fire safety activities to delivering the fire prevention agenda has real impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look to the future this isn’t the time to slow down - injuries rose by nine per cent over the past year, clearly emphasising the need a high profile focus to remain on prevention activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="resetting-the-relationship"&gt;Resetting the relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to continue the step change in the way we all engage. I am of course talking of resetting the relationship which is the clear vision I have been talking about it since my first speech back to you in Harrogate in 2010 - I would hope that it is something that you all recognise by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vision is at the very heart of the Coalition Government’s ambition - putting power back where it belongs - in communities and the locally elected councillors who represent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year we have been making this a reality. The provisions for fire and rescue authorities within the Localism Act came into force 18 February 2012. This is a huge milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empowering fire and rescue authorities with greater freedoms and flexibilities is a good example of central Government stepping back and letting you get on with your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also seen milestones such as the Open Public Service White Paper and new guidance on data transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My department has already begun to change the way it works with you and together we have made some great steps forward in our vision to reset our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the announcement a couple of weeks ago on of funding for future control rooms services saw a localist approach in action, securing improvements in national resilience, rather than the flawed top-down regionalisation of the fire service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last autumn we undertook a pre-market engagement exercise to help inform our view and options in securing the future of the Fire Service College. Having considered responses to the pre-market engagement with the help of our partners, the option which is emerging as the most likely to meet our objective is to sell the college as a going concern to a private sector company who would continue to operate the college as a training centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the college freed from the constraints of government ownership, a private sector owner can bring innovation and investment to the College, benefiting taxpayers, local residents, the Fire and Rescue Service and, ultimately, strengthening national resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to be able to confirm the final decision shortly but if the College is sold we shall, insist on a number of conditions on the proposed sale, including commitments not only that the college will be preserved as a national training college for the fire and rescue authorities, but also that it will continue to offer wider national resilience and emergency services training and exercises, that the wider emergency services will be involved in the overall setting of training governance and that government permission will be required to sell the site on for other uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that fire and rescue authorities do not want to lose the college so if the decision is to sell it as a going concern I do hope that you will continue to support the college in its new ventures. In short use it or lose it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="national-framework"&gt;National Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the resetting the relationship theme there are a few issues I would like to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will be aware the consultation on the draft National Framework has just closed and taking an early view of some of the responses we have noted the request for more guidance and detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing I can do to help you improve services is to set the framework and context and get out of the way and let you get on with your job. I will not second guess you with central government guidance unless absolutely necessary. This is role for you as local leaders, supported by your national leadership bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know that I am keen that there are robust scrutiny arrangements in place. Many of you in fire and rescue authorities will already arrangements in place that meet the requirement in the draft Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not consider it appropriate for proper scrutiny of decision making on public safety and how public funds are used to be treated as an extravagance that gets in the way of the day job - it is a core function of any public service to act in a transparent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you have asked for more information on assurance statements. I see these as a proportionate requirement for an important public service with no specific inspectorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am keen not to duplicate existing arrangements with these statements; and have asked my officials to work with the Local Government Association and the Chief Fire Officers Association to deliver a light touch approach to delivering such statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also aware that there has been some concern that the draft Framework doesn’t highlight, as strongly as it has previously, achievements on fire prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m absolutely sure no one doubts the significant contribution and impact the fire and rescue authorities have on protecting communities, especially those most vulnerable to fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is local fire and rescue authorities are delivering their statutory duties to promote fire safety through innovative partnership approaches and engaging local communities. I am confident that these measures are saving lives and I support them. It is not central government’s role to meddle in this good practice by adding additional requirements or window dressing platitudes through the National Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we will say is that you need to engage your communities - give them a real understanding of the risks being faced and the full range of what you are doing so they can better understand why you make the decisions you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know there are some increasingly tough decisions to be made on how best to allocate prevention, protection and operational resources locally to effectively mitigate both existing and potential risks. And that this needs to be done in a way that meets community aspirations in an open and consultative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By giving communities a voice, you give them a choice;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choice to make their views known on whether their priorities are the same as yours;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choice to come up with new ideas on service provision; and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choice to challenge you on these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;National resilience remains a priority for government, and we will continue to retain strategic responsibility for ensuring that we are a nation resilient to significant risks. But we can only do this together, through true partnership, working across all local and national responders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I think we need a Fire and Rescue Strategic Resilience Board, to bring key partners together to consider national resilience issues. Of course, government will continue to set the strategic direction, but our approach to national resilience must be based on and drawn from local capability, expertise, knowledge and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can only prepare effectively if we have an approach to resilience, based on the local expertise and knowledge that is held by fire and rescue authorities. This is because every major emergency originates as a local emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The involvement and leadership of all fire and rescue authorities is needed to ensure that the necessary capability is in place to keep communities safe. This means being able to plan effectively for all incidents and emergencies, irrespective of whether such emergencies are of a local, cross-border or national nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities rightly expect their local fire and rescue authorities to play their part in keeping the country safe, and I am pleased to see that a number of you embrace this approach to national resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not every one holds this view, and some query the Framework’s expression of your Civil Contingency Act duties. I want to be clear that the draft Framework does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; set out any new roles and responsibilities in relation to national resilience for fire and rescue authorities. The draft Framework simply sets them out clearly and succinctly. The existing National Framework, Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, the Emergencies Order 2007 and the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 all set out requirements in relation to national resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have stated in the draft Framework that if it is seen that there is a need for building new national resilience capabilities, the case for who should provide the capability and how it should be funded will be considered carefully in line with the new burdens doctrine. All of this should ensure that our overall national resilience capability remains strong, and, with your leadership and commitment, we can continue to ensure that we are collectively working to ensure the safety of our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="funding"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of course mindful of the financial backdrop to all this change. We have taken tough decisions necessary to get public spending under control. No-one in this room is under any illusions about the wider economic challenges we face today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every bit of the public sector needs to play its part to cut the deficit inherited from the last administration. Despite the need to cut the national deficit, fire and rescue, as a frontline emergency service, has been given some funding protection with reductions back-loaded to give more time for sensible savings to be made without impacting on the quality and breadth of services offered to communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding reductions to fire and rescue authorities have been less than those applied to local authorities in general and while spending decisions will be decided locally by individual fire and rescue authorities, there are many good examples that show that savings can be made without affecting the quality and breadth of front line services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further funding reductions are on their way for the whole of the public sector, including fire and rescue authorities. I’ve received representations from a number of you, and know that many of you are making great strives in efficiency. Thankfully fatalities are at an all time low and, thanks to innovation in industry, government action and the efforts of fire and rescue authorities, risks are falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ever there was a time for strong local leadership, it’s now. Fire and rescue authorities need to look closely at their own service configuration and recognise that we are all delivering services in a new environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making such decisions fire and rescue authorities use integrated risk management planning to identify and assess local need and then put plans in place to mitigate risks to communities. For each authority, their integrated risk management plan will take account of their overall budget and resource to make strategic and operational decisions on the siting of fire stations, the staffing and equipping of such stations, and hours of operation of each station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire and rescue authorities already have a strong record of delivering efficiencies and have developed a number of methods through which they could achieve the savings. A couple of examples…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South East Fire Improvement Partnership is a collaborative procurement partnership providing work-wear uniforms for nine fire and rescue authorities involved in the partnership [Buckinghamshire; East Sussex; Hampshire, Isle of Wight; Kent; Oxfordshire; Royal Berkshire; Surrey and West Sussex]. I understand that initial savings are of over £500,000 with further efficiencies predicted over the whole life of the contract. This contract is now being rolled out to other fire and rescue authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you are being imaginative on staffing arrangements. Steve, if I may highlight Manchester’s initiative to make savings , as just one example. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority are moving to a four shift annualised system where firefighters operate a much more flexible duty system by attending work outside of normal hours of duty to cover shortfalls, allowing for reductions in the size of the workforce overall. Further savings are being made by fire risk based availability of fire engines and the banking of firefighters hours to cover shortfalls during busier times. These changes in cover have been made against a backdrop of reductions in incidents driven by fire prevention work in communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a different type of example I’d like to highlight Lee Howell’s work in Devon &amp;amp; Somerset. They have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Falck EMS in June 2011 to develop ways of working together. Falck is a company providing emergency, training and assistance services, including fire fighting, fire training and fire consultancy services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am sure there are many more examples from across fire and rescue authorities that you can all look at to adapt to local circumstances, to help you meet the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="capital-grant-funding"&gt;Capital Grant Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased today to announce the opening of the bidding process for capital grant funding for all fire and rescue authorities for 2013-15 which will support further improvements and efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we consulted on options for the distribution of capital grant funding, and on our proposal that fire capital grant funding be distributed based on a combination of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an efficiency fund, administered via a bidding process; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pro rata distribution using the current distribution method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be able to find the guidance, timelines and related documents on our website by later today and we hope to have concluded the bidding process and made announcements on outcomes by the autumn this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="pensions"&gt;Pensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I wanted to just briefly touch upon the issue of pensions which I understandably know is of real importance to your workforce. As you will be aware the Heads of agreement was reached on the 9th of February for a new pension scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheme remains a very good scheme, affording protection for those closest to retirement. Detailed discussions are ongoing with unions and the Local Government Association on behalf of the employers and local employers have a key role in engaging with their workforces over what the reform means for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain optimistic that reform can be delivered through agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can appreciate that the last year has been a period of much change and the pace has been rapid. Your drive and your expertise are essential to meeting these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this important year, when we can look forward with pride and anticipation to this summer’s Olympic and Paralympic Games and the key roles during the Torch Relay and both Games the Fire and Rescue Service will be playing, and when our communities will be at the proudest, it seems right that we are continuing to restore focus back where it belongs, in our communities and with those elected members who serve them. It is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lose-some-sleep-but-save-a-life-this-weekend-when-you-change-your-clock-test-your-smoke-alarm"/>
    <title>Lose some sleep but save a life this weekend: when you change your clock, test your smoke alarm</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fire Kills campaign is urging people to make a potentially life-saving move when they change their clocks on Sunday 25 March - by taking a moment to test their smoke alarm too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love it or loathe it, the twice-yearly clock change is a routine part of everyone’s lives. Losing that extra hour’s sleep on Sunday 25 March may not be appealing, but turning the clocks forward will already be on the ‘to-do’ list of nearly all UK households.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while we all keep our clocks up-to-time and working, it’s shocking to realise that many people don’t bother to do the simplest of tests to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones from the danger of fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. But just half of all householders who own a smoke alarm say that they test it to make sure it’s working on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re four times more likely to die in a fire if your smoke alarm is not working. So it’s clear that the simple act of testing your alarm should be a vital part of any household routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 31,477 accidental fires in the home in England last year, which resulted in 214 deaths and 6,526 injuries. The Fire Kills Campaign hopes that by adding this simple check to everyone’s clock-change routine, many more lives could be saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone soon notices when a clock stops ticking, but it’s not so easy to be sure that your smoke alarm is still in working order. Whether the battery is flat, has been removed for a kid’s toy or the connection is loose, everyone should take the time to test their smoke alarm - it doesn’t take long at all.
&amp;gt; “You’re four times more likely to die in a fire without a working smoke alarm, but only half of people who own one say they take the time to check it regularly.
&amp;gt; “We’re all losing sleep at the start of British Summer Time, but testing your smoke alarm could save you from losing a lot more. As you put your clocks forward over the weekend, take an extra moment to push the button - it could save your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive of The Fire Fighters Charity John Parry said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our charity aims to make a positive difference by supporting people in the fire and rescue community when they are in need. We know just how hard the fire service works to prevent fires from starting in the first place, so we are urging people to heed the advice of their local fire fighters now that British Summer Time is upon us. When you put your clocks forward this March, please take an extra moment to push the button on your smoke alarm to make sure it’s working properly - it could save your life and that of your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen out for radio and press adverts supporting the ‘When you change your clocks, Test your smoke alarm’ campaign. An online video has also been released showing a mantelpiece clock melting in the heat of a house fire - bringing home the harsh reality of the consequences of a fire in the home. Find it at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://bit.ly/FKclock"&gt;http://bit.ly/FKclock&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an elderly relative or are a carer for somebody less able to test their smoke alarm, why not offer to do it for them? It only takes a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help keep yourself and your loved ones safe in the home by following these simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A working smoke alarm can buy you valuable time to get out, stay out and call 999. Make sure you fit one on every level of your home and test them regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make testing your smoke alarm part of your household routine. Test the alarm by pressing the button regularly; change your battery once a year or invest in a 10-year alarm; and clean the alarm casing twice a year to ensure dust isn’t blocking the sensor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatever happens, never remove the battery in your smoke alarm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that everyone in your home knows what to do in a fire and practise your escape route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For more information visit the Fire Kills campaign’s Facebook page at &lt;a rel="external" href="https://www.facebook.com/firekills"&gt;www.facebook.com/firekills&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want an extra nudge to test your smoke alarm regularly, try setting an automatic reminder. Safelincs, in partnership with Fire Kills, has created a free service that reminds you, by email or text, when it’s time to test your smoke alarm, change the battery or renew the unit. The service is completely free and can be cancelled at any time: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders/"&gt;www.safelincs.co.uk/reminders&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. British Summer Time begins on the last Sunday in March. This year the clocks go forward at 1.00 am on 25 March, moving forward to 2.00 am across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. There were 31,477 accidental fires in the home in England last year, which resulted in 214 deaths and 6,526 injuries.

    <title>Fire Minister announces funding for successful control centre projects</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister Bob Neill has today announced funding of £74 million to support a range of locally-led projects to improve the resilience and efficiency of local fire and rescue control rooms across England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows on from the termination by the Coalition Government of the last Government’s FireControl project, which sought to regionalise fire control rooms across England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire Minister, Bob Neill MP, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government is adopting a more localist approach to help secure improvements in national resilience, rather than trying to impose a forced regionalisation of the fire service. These locally-led bids show we can strengthen national resilience and adopt new technology to save lives, without top-down Whitehall micro-management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chief Fire Officers Association said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Chief Fire Officers Association National Resilience has developed a detailed peer support process designed to provide assistance and support to fire authorities with the implementation of their control room improvement plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A full copy of today’s Written Ministerial Statement can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2097824"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/2097824&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2010, Fire Minister Bob Neill MP announced the termination of the main IT contract and closure of the FiReControl project. The project began in 2004, and had aimed to replace England’s 46 standalone fire and rescue control rooms with a nine regional control centres. The contract was terminated because the contractor EADS Defence and Security (now trading as Cassidian) Ltd could not meet the requirements of the project within an acceptable timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The National Audit Office produced a critical report of the FireControl programme in July 2011, available here: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/1012/failure_of_firecontrol.aspx"&gt;www.nao.org.uk/publications/1012/failure_of_firecontrol.aspx&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) consulted on the future of fire and rescue control services in England from 13 January to 8 April 2011. The consultation document can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/fireandrescuecontrolservices&lt;/a&gt; and the response document at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/controlservicessummaryresponses"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/fire/controlservicessummaryresponses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s list of successful projects is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fire and rescue control services</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the Government is publishing the outcome of its invitation to fire and rescue authorities in England to submit their plans to improve the resilience, efficiency and technology in their control services following the termination of the last Government’s FiReControl project in December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the last administration, the Coalition Government is adopting a localist approach to help secure improvements in national resilience, rather than the flawed approach of FireControl which tried to impose a top-down regionalisation of the fire service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I announced in my statement of 13 December 2011, Official Report, Column 90WS, the Government is making available £81 million for local improvements - up to £1.8 million for each authority - and additional funding of £1.8 million to secure benefits of national importance bringing total funding available to £82.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all the fire and rescue authorities that responded to this invitation and for their co-operation in sharing their plans. Most respondents agreed with the Government’s preferred approach of achieving this through improvements and increased collaboration - in a locally-determined manner, with some Government support. The plans submitted by fire and rescue authorities have reinforced this approach and shown how a localist approach will build resilience on a national scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach also seeks to take steps to tackle the legacy of the empty Regional Fire Control buildings which we have inherited, and which as the National Audit Office has observed, were a consequence of the flawed procurement process of the FiReControl programme. Some of these bids will make use of these legacy buildings; otherwise, we are separately seeking to dispose of the buildings for appropriate public or private sector use, to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Government has also acknowledged the criticism of the National Audit Office of the FiReControl programme. As it stated in its report of 1 July 2011, HC 1272:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The FiReControl project was flawed from the outset because it did not have the support of those essential to its success-local Fire and Rescue Services. The Department rushed the start of the project, failing to follow proper procedures. Ineffective checks and balances during initiation and early stages meant the Department committed itself to the project on the basis of broad-brush and inaccurate estimates of costs and benefits and an unrealistic delivery timetable, and agreed an inadequate contract with its IT supplier. The Department under-appreciated the project’s complexity, and then mismanaged the IT contractor’s performance and delivery. The Department failed to provide the necessary leadership to make the project successful, over-relying on poorly managed consultants and failing to sort out early problems with delivery by the contractor. The Department took a firmer grip of the project from 2009 and terminated the contract in December 2010 to avoid even more money being wasted.” (National Audit Office press release, The Failure of the FiReControl project, 1 July 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, 23 bids were received from 44 of the 46 fire and rescue authorities. The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority did not submit a bid as alternative arrangements had been agreed previously and resulted in London’s fire control arrangements being provided from a new Operations Centre in Merton, which I had the pleasure of opening on 1 February. The Isles of Scilly Fire and Rescue Authority did not bid because its control arrangements are already provided by Cornwall Fire and Rescue Authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bids outline a series of local proposals to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve the efficiency of fire and rescue control rooms; for example, Staffordshire and West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authorities aim to combine the provision of control room services for both authorities sharing one common call handling and mobilising, command and control system, including a secondary control providing local resilience. Combining control services will provide the opportunity to improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen local resilience; for example, resilience for large incidents and spate conditions in Buckinghamshire, Cambridge and Suffolk will be enhanced due to greater numbers of control staff being on duty at any one time than had they worked in isolation and create a larger pool to ‘recall to duty’ if required, thereby strengthening the building blocks of national resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve the ability to interoperate with each other and with other emergency services and agencies; 36 fire and rescue authorities’ submitted joint bids that involved collaboration with at least one other fire and rescue authority. The other 8 fire and rescue authorities’ submitted bids that involved collaboration with other emergency or local services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deliver cumulative financial savings of over £120 million by 2021; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide a platform for further strengthening and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each bid has been considered carefully in line with the criteria I set out in July for value for money, efficiency and resilience. The resilience aspects of each bid were assessed by the Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser. I am pleased to be able to announce that I will be providing funding this year to the following fire and rescue authorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buckinghamshire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cambridgeshire and Suffolk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cornwall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devon &amp;amp; Somerset, Dorset, Hampshire and Wiltshire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Essex and Bedfordshire &amp;amp; Luton&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hereford &amp;amp; Worcester and Shropshire &amp;amp; Wrekin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hertfordshire, Humberside, Lincolnshire and Norfolk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isle of Wight and Surrey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merseyside&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Northamptonshire and Warwickshire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oxfordshire and Berkshire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;South and West Yorkshire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staffordshire and West Midlands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tyne &amp;amp; Wear and Northumberland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rejected 13 requests for funding above the indicative amount of £1.8 million per fire and rescue authority. In those cases, I am awarding £1.8 million per fire and rescue authority. The submissions did not provide evidence of exceptional factors sufficient to justify a higher amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These allocations are in addition to early bids that I had already accepted from: a consortia of four fire and rescue authorities (for Lancashire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Cumbria); Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Authority; and East and West Sussex Fire and Rescue Authorities. I awarded the consortia of four authorities an additional £300,000 per authority above the indicative amount because their plans involve utilising the new Control Centre in Warrington and will deliver additional savings to the public.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three bids from English fire and rescue authorities which require further work before I can award any funding. I have asked officials to work with Avon Fire and Rescue Authority, Cleveland Fire and Rescue Authority and North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Authority with the aim of concluding matters by the end of June. I have set aside funding for them. We received one bid from a Welsh Joint Emergency Services Group which was out scope for the funding and has therefore been rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also announcing today that I am minded to provide some funding from the £1.8 million fund for interoperability to a collaborative partnership of 13 fire and rescue authorities which has submitted a bid to develop standard operating procedures. I have asked officials to work with the authorities concerned to significantly reduce costs and ensure proposals align and support wider work now underway on cross ‘blue light’ service interoperability and have potential to be adopted across all fire and rescue authorities. We will be reviewing the further work underway on cross-service interoperability and will consider whether there is other essential work that ought to be funded from the £1.8 million interoperability fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Department is writing today to fire and rescue authorities to notify them of the outcome of their bids. Where bids have not been accepted this communication will set out the next steps.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to note that the Chief Fire Officers Association National Resilience has developed a detailed peer support process designed to provide assistance and support to fire authorities with the implementation of their control room improvement plans. This will provide central support to single fire authorities, or groups of partnering authorities, to facilitate implementation of their proposals to improve or replace their fire control facilities. It will also include the provision of a sector owned central repository to collate and manage information that will aid all fire authorities with the improvement or replacement of existing fire control facilities, along with the provision of professional support and assistance to resolve problems or issues when required or requested to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents accompanying this statement have been placed in the Library of the House and on my department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Ministers see riot-recovery underway in Greenwich, Manchester and Salford</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers have visited more towns that were badly affected by the riots, to see progress six months on and meet the local people, traders and council workers getting their communities back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Secretary of State Eric Pickles visit to Tottenham last week, Local Government Minister Bob Neill visited Woolwich and Communities Minister Andrew Stunell headed to Manchester and Salford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the riots the Government acted quickly to make available a multi-million pound package of support to enable councils to act swiftly and confidently to restore communities and get support to local people and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="woolwich"&gt;Woolwich&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Neill returned to Woolwich to see first hand how the community is using the support available to restore, rebuild and improve the town centre. He was first there in the immediate aftermath of the riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling into local businesses, Mr Neill talked to traders about the impact of the riots and how the community rallied round to help get them get back on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local council leader Chris Roberts and Chief Executive Mary Ney accompanied the Minister. The council set up the Greenwich Backing Local Business fund and opened a special advice surgery for more than 60 businesses to drop in to get expert advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Bob Neill said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The picture here in Woolwich is very different to the one I saw in the immediate aftermath of the riots. Despite the attempts of a few to wreak havoc, the community in Woolwich have pulled together to restore their town.
&amp;gt; “The progress well underway in Woolwich is symbolic of a community that is proud of their local area, their local businesses and determined to see their town thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="manchester-and-salford"&gt;Manchester and Salford&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting local people, traders and council workers in Manchester and Salford, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell praised the energetic way communities came together in the aftermath of the riots and pointed to the true examples of community spirit in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst the actions of a small minority determined on causing destruction caught our attention for a moment, it is the examples of true community spirit that will endure; the ‘broom armies’, the campaigns to support local businesses, the messages of pride in the area posted on shop fronts.
&amp;gt; “It’s been great to meet the people that paint the real picture of community life in Manchester and Salford and see that recovery and progress is well underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stunell also met with council leaders in both areas to discuss the impact of the riots and the support improvement in the areas. An ‘I love Salford’ campaign was launched to build up the community spirit and invite people to show their support for their area by shopping locally and wearing campaign badges. In Manchester a campaign group called ‘Eye on Manchester’ rallied support from locals to help in the clean up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Heads of agreement for firefighters' pension scheme reached</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has today published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/firefighters-pension-scheme-heads-of-agreement"&gt;heads of agreement&lt;/a&gt; for the firefighters’ pension scheme in England. This follows constructive engagement with representatives of all 4 firefighter unions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work in it. The government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, these proposals aim to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heads of agreement presents a fair and affordable long-term reform package that means firefighters will look to their future retirement with certainty and with a pension to reflect their valuable years of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available: a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This heads of agreement sets out the main elements of a scheme design that will form the basis for ongoing discussions about reforms to be introduced from 2015. Trades unions have agreed to take this package to their executives and, if appropriate, their membership for further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further discussions on the remaining detail will take place over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Firefighters' pension scheme</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following constructive discussions with the firefighters’ trades unions, on 8 December I wrote to all of the firefighters’ trades unions to issue the cost ceiling for the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme. This included a generous accrual rate, and provided protection for all those within ten years of their current scheme’s Normal Pension Age from any change in when they can retire, nor any decrease in the pension they receive at their current Normal Pension Age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government pays tribute to the importance of the work undertaken by our fire and rescue service and the bravery, dedication and professionalism of the men and women who work within it. The Government is committed to providing public service pensions that are sustainable, fair and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the proposals brought forward by Lord Hutton, these proposals aim to strike a balanced deal between public service workers and the taxpayer. They will ensure that public service workers continue to have access to good pensions, while taxpayers benefit from greater control over their costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public sector pensions will remain among the very best available - a guaranteed level and inflation proofed. Only 1 in 10 private sector workers have access to such schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that the Heads of Agreement for the design of a new pension scheme for firefighters’ in England has now been established. Each trades union with firefighter members will now consider the main design elements of a new scheme to be available for their members from 2015. Further work will take place over the coming weeks to establish the final details and Executives can consult members as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly grateful for the manner in which firefighters’ trades unions have maintained a constructive dialogue over the emerging detailed elements of the new Scheme. Further discussion will now take place through the Scheme’s Pension Reform Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be full protection for the accrued rights of existing scheme members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all benefits accrued under final salary arrangements will be linked to the members’ final salary, in accordance with the rules of the members’ current schemes, when they leave the reformed scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;full recognition of a members’ expectation to double accrual for service accrued under the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme 1992 (‘the 1992 scheme’), so that a members’ full continuous pensionable service upon retirement will be used to calculate an averaged accrual rate to be applied to service accrued under the 1992 scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;members to be able to access their 1992 scheme benefits when they retire at that scheme’s ordinary pension age (i.e. from age 50 with 25 or more years pensionable service), subject to abatement rules for that scheme. Pensionable service for the purpose of calculating the ordinary pension age will include any continuous pensionable service accrued under both the 1992 scheme and the 2015 scheme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;members will continue to have access to an actuarially assessed commutation factor for benefits accrued under the 1992 scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also will be transitional protections for qualifying, existing members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all active scheme members who, as of 1 April 2012, have 10 years or less to their current Normal Pension Age will see no change in when they can retire, nor any decrease in the amount of pension they receive at their current Normal Pension Age. This protection will be achieved by the member remaining in their current scheme until they retire.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there will be a further 4 years of tapered protection for scheme members. Members who are up to 14 years from their current Normal Pension Age, as of 1 April 2012, will have limited protection so that on average for every month of age they are beyond 10 years of their Normal Pension Age, they gain about 53 days of protection. The last day of protected service for any member will be 31 March 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main parameters of the new scheme are set out below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a. a pension scheme design based on career average revalued earnings
&amp;gt; b. a provisional accrual rate of 1/58.7th of pensionable earnings each year, subject to further agreement on the outstanding issues
&amp;gt; c. there will be no cap on how much pension can be accrued
&amp;gt; d. a revaluation rate of active members’ benefits in line with average weekly earnings
&amp;gt; e. pensions in payment and deferred benefits to increase in line with Prices Index (currently Consumer Prices Index)
&amp;gt; f. average member contributions of 13.2 per cent from April 2015, with some protection for new entrants. However, the Government will review the impact of the proposed 2012-13 contribution changes, including the effect of membership opt-outs, before taking final decisions on how future increases will be delivered in 2013-14 and 2014-15, and in the new scheme.
&amp;gt; g. flexible retirement from the scheme’s minimum pension age of 55, built around the scheme’s normal pension age of 60, with members able to take their pension from minimum pension age as follows:
» - for all active members who are aged 57 or more at retirement, 2015 scheme benefits taken before Normal Pension Age will be actuarially reduced with reference to the 2015 scheme’s Normal Pension Age, rather than the deferred pension age
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; - all other members will have their 2015 scheme benefits actuarially reduced on a cost neutral basis from the scheme’s deferred pension age
&amp;gt; h. the Normal Pension Age will be subject to regular review. These reviews will consider the increasing State Pension Age and any changes to it, alongside evidence from interested parties, including unions and employers. It will consider if the Normal Pension Age of 60 remains relevant, taking account of the economical, efficient and effective management of the fire service, the changing profile of the workforce and the occupational demands of, and fitness standards for, firefighting roles
&amp;gt; i. this regular review will be informed by such research carried out by the Firefighters’ Pension Committee, which will monitor and collate scheme data and experience
&amp;gt; j. late retirement factors for members retiring from active service to be actuarially neutral from Normal Pension Age
&amp;gt; k. a deferred pension age equal to the individuals’ State Pension Age
&amp;gt; l. optional lump sum by commutation at a rate of £12 for every £1 per annum of pension foregone in accordance with HMRC limits and regulations
&amp;gt; m. abatement in existing schemes to continue
&amp;gt; n. ill-health retirement and all other ancillary benefits to be based on the arrangements in the 2006 scheme
&amp;gt; o. an employer contribution cap and floor to provide backstop protection to the taxpayer against unforeseen costs and risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government Actuary’s Department has confirmed that this scheme design does not exceed the cost ceiling set by the Government. Copies of the Heads of Agreement and the Government Actuary’s Department verification report have been placed in the Library.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smart app to help defuse fire danger</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrical Fire Safety Week - 23rd -29th January 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shocking statistics show that half of all accidental house fires were caused by faulty or misused electrical equipment in 2010/11, the Fire Kills campaign is highlighting a smartphone app from the Electrical Safety Council which will help people defuse the danger in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From faulty fridges and forgotten irons, to overloaded plugs and dodgy wiring - electrical equipment can be an unnoticed fire hazard in the home.  And with the recent cold weather, many sockets could still be overloaded with additional space heaters and electric blankets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010-11, accidental fires in the home caused by faulty or misused electrical products resulted in nearly 40 deaths across the country. As part of Electrical Fire Safety Week - 23 - 29 January - we’re asking people to look around their homes, identify all the potential risks and take extra care when using electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Electrical Safety Council’s app helps people identify risks in their home and offers advice on resolving them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Sir Ken Knight said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Electrical equipment is an inescapable part of all our lives, from essentials like heating and lights to luxuries like entertainment systems or beauty products. Half of all accidental fires begin with an electrical appliance, so it’s really important to be sure that your electrics are in good working order and are used properly.
&amp;gt; “Most electrical fires start in the kitchen, so be extra careful with cooking equipment. Fire in the home can be devastating, but many of these fires are preventable. By following some simple steps, you can help keep you and your loved ones safe from fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorraine Carney Senior Campaigns Manager at the Electrical Safety Council said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With electricity such an integral part of our lives it is understandable that people tend to take it for granted. But that doesn’t mean we can forget basic safety precautions. There is a worrying gap between the public’s perception of electrical danger and the reality, with people making simple yet potentially fatal errors that can be easily prevented
&amp;gt; “The ESC’s free ‘Home Electrical Safety Check’ app was designed to bridge that gap. We wanted to create something which people would find simple to use and hope that they will download it, check their homes and take corrective action”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every individual can take steps to help themselves by checking that the electrical equipment they use everyday is in good shape and is operated properly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t overload plug sockets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regularly check for worn or frayed wires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug appliances when not in use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep appliances clean and in good working order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider using a Residual Current Device which works like a circuit breaker to protect against electric shocks and reduces the risk of electrical fires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Electrical Safety Council advises that heaters should be kept clear from curtains and furniture and should never be used for drying clothes. Your electric blanket should be unplugged before you go to bed, unless it has a thermostat for safe all-night use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. A residual current device - known as an RCD - is a life-saving device which is designed to prevent you from getting a fatal electric shock if you touch something live, such as a bare wire. It provides a level of protection that ordinary fuses or circuit-breakers cannot provide. Residual current device protection is particularly important when using electrical equipment outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hard-wired for sound: love to hate your smoke alarm</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever burnt their bacon or smoked in the comfort of their home will know that an accidentally triggered smoke alarm can be a frustrating experience. But with one in three battery operated smoke alarms failing in a house fire - most often because the battery has been removed - the Fire Kills campaign is reminding people that there’s a very good reason why we all hate the sound of the smoke alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="evolutionary-instincts"&gt;Evolutionary instincts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about the pitch, volume, and pattern of a smoke alarm’s horn are specifically designed to trigger instinctive danger responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are evolutionally hard wired to notice changes in the sounds around us. In years gone by this natural instinct gave us early warning of approaching predators, but today it means that unusual sounds like a smoke alarm or siren will set off warning signals in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a sounder pitched at the most sensitive range of the human hearing (3,000Hz), a triggered alarm will instantly grab the attention, while the persistent beeping means that we can’t get used to the noise and tune it out as we do with many everyday sounds. Smoke alarms set at lower frequencies or set to vibrate and flash can produce the same effect for the hard of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All smoke alarms also have to be capable of waking an adult from deep sleep, which means they must sound at a minimum of 85 decibels from three metres away - that’s comparable to the volume of a bus passing through your living room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other sounds that affect the ear in this way include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opera Singers, who sing loudest at the frequencies where the ear is most sensitive so they can be heard over the orchestra.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vehicle reverse warnings, which caused so many noise complaints in residential areas that alternative versions have been developed with, for example, a “shh shh” noise instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Ken Knight, the Government’s Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a familiar situation - burning bacon or a sneaky cigarette can set a smoke alarm off all too easily, and the noise is enough to drive you out of house and home. But that’s exactly the point of a smoke alarm - we are hard-wired to associate its sound with danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-matter-of-life-and-death"&gt;A matter of life and death&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never, ever remove the batteries in your alarm. It may be frustrating to find your fry-up has set it off again, but a working smoke alarm could mean the difference between life and death in a real house fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Trevor Cox, President of the Institute of Acoustics said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The high pitched beep-beep-beep of a smoke alarm can be irritating when set off by accident. But what makes that sound annoying - the pitch, volume and pattern of the alarm - all trigger powerful instinctive threat responses in your brain and warn you of danger. If you’re in a real fire, this irritating sound could save your life, so trust your instincts and check your smoke alarm regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma Harrison, RNID Director of Public Engagement said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fire can strike at anyone’s home, but not everyone is equally protected because people who are deaf or hard of hearing can’t rely on hearing an ordinary alarm. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there a wide range of smoke alarms available specifically designed for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An average smoke alarm is required to sound at 85 decibels from a distance of three metres - it will be much louder at close range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing protection becomes necessary in an industrial environment at 85 decibels as sustained exposure could result in hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other everyday noises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Library: 30db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normal Conversation: 30db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average office: 60 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alarm clock: 70 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Barking dog: 75 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smoke alarm (3 metres) 85 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aeroplane from a mile away:85 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Motorbike:100 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orchestra: 105 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power saw: 110 db&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jet takeoff: 140 db&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added to this, most smoke alarms sound at a frequency of around 3000 Hz, the uppermost range of a piccolo or violin.&lt;/p&gt;
