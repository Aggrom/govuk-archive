    <title>DCLG statement of new regulation - 1 January to 30 June 2013</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Overview of regulations that are scheduled to be implemented or removed between 1 January and 30 June 2013.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forward look of all regulations in scope of government’s ‘one-in, two-out’ regime that are scheduled to come into force between 1 January and 30 June 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is published every 6 months to give businesses an indication of when regulations affecting them will be coming into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headline figures show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are introducing 24 measures in this period, 20 of which are deregulatory measures that will reduce the burden on business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;none of these measures will increase the regulatory burden on businesses, as they are all either deregulatory measures that will bring savings to business, or regulatory measures that have no cost to business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Regulatory Policy Committee have evaluated 5 of our measures and estimated that they will reduce the burden on business by £45.36 million per year. We expect this figure to rise considerably as our other measures are validated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
