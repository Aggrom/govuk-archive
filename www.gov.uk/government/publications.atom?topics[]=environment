    <title>Strategic environmental assessment about revoking the North East regional strategy: environmental report</title>

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the period all consultation responses will be considered, including those already submitted during the earlier response period. Responses are invited on all aspects of the report and proposal including the supporting appendices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proposes to retain the saved structure plan policy S5 from the Northumberland County and National Park Joint Structure Plan First Alteration relating to the green belt at Morpeth. Removing this policy before the council has adopted a local plan which defines green belt boundaries could put green belt land at risk from unwanted development. This is in line with the Coalition Agreement to safeguard green belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes are intended to reduce the administrative burden of the TPO system, particularly on local planning authorities, and increase accessibility to a more equitable system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Code for sustainable homes and the energy efficiency standard for zero carbon homes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation seeks views on changes to the code for sustainable homes in 2010, to align with changes to Part L of the Building Regulations and the proposed approach to adopting the 2016 definition of zero carbon.Therefore the most significant changes are within the energy section of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consultation also puts forward our proposed changes to credit issues such as lifetime homes, home security, surface water run-off and waste as well as setting out issues that are being considered for further investigation in the future. It also seeks views on the energy efficiency definition to be incorporated into the definition of zero carbon homes from 2016 and whether that should be introduced into Building Regulations at an intermediate level from 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part A looks at changes to the code for sustainable homes and incorporates the proposed fabric energy efficiency standards being consulted on in Part B of the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
