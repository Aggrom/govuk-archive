    <title>Typhoon jets arrive at RAF Northolt for Olympics role</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time fighter planes have been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jets’ arrival marks the start of specialist training which will result in increased flying activity over London and the Home Counties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codenamed Olympic Guardian, the nine-day exercise will put airmen, soldiers and sailors through their paces in the skies over the South East. The exercise runs from 2 to 10 May, and it is likely that people will notice an increase in highly visible air activity (particularly on 5 and 6 May).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise will test the procedures military aircrews will use to intercept and communicate with aircraft breaching restricted airspace during the Olympics, and the actions they must take in response. Pilots entering restricted airspace can expect to be intercepted by Typhoon fighters or military helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air security plan for the Olympic Games builds on the Royal Air Force’s existing defence of UK airspace, which includes round-the-clock radar surveillance and Typhoon fighters held at high readiness every day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise integrates the additional forces being used to ensure the safety of the Olympics, as part of the Ministry of Defence’s role to ensure a safe and secure Games this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• the Typhoon fighters which arrived at RAF Northolt today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• RAF Puma aircraft - together with Royal Navy and Army Lynx helicopters - carrying teams of RAF Regiment snipers to intercept aircraft in restricted airspace, and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• airborne surveillance aircraft including RAF E-3D Sentry aircraft and Royal Navy Sea King ASaC (Airborne Surveillance and Control) helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="An RAF Typhoon arrives at RAF Northolt" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/4955/Typhoon_jets_arrive_at_RAF_Northolt_for_Olympics_role-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;An RAF Typhoon arrives at RAF Northolt [Picture: Senior Aircraftman Steve Buckley, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the ground, the RAF is providing additional mobile ground radar systems (Type 101 radar), while the Army is deploying air observers and high velocity and Rapier missile systems, which also provide radar detection capability, to provide additional layers of radar coverage. A final decision on the deployment of these capabilities has yet to be taken by the Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no specific threat to the Games, we have to be ready to assist in delivering a safe and secure Olympics for all to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The fact that our state-of-the-art Typhoons will be stationed at RAF Northolt underlines the commitment of the Ministry of Defence and our Armed Forces to keeping the public safe at a time when the world will be watching us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Vice-Marshal Stuart Atha, Air Component Commander for Olympics Air Security, said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we undertake this essential training, there will be a visible and audible presence of RAF Typhoon and military helicopters operating above Greater London and the Home Counties. There will also be flights occurring throughout the exercise period to allow pilots and other forces to become familiar with operating in the London and Home Counties airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have sought to limit the amount of flying to the minimum required to ensure that our Forces are ready for their important role delivering air security for the Olympics, balancing this against the need for us to reduce disturbance to a minimum. But we hope that people will understand the need for this very important training, and we thank them for their continued strong support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/piracy-ransoms-task-force-publishes-recommendations"/>
    <title>Piracy Ransoms Task Force publishes recommendations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force was established by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, after the London Conference on Somalia in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14-nation Task Force, brought together policy makers from some of the world’s largest Flag States (countries where vessels are registered), nations whose seafarers are most commonly at risk, and those countries at the forefront of the military response to piracy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force made four recommendations in its final report to the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia in New York:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a new strategic partnership between Flag States, the private sector and law enforcement agencies that brings together those tackling piracy and those subjected to it in a united effort to break the piracy business model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a more co-ordinated approach to information-sharing to provide evidence to pursue and prosecute all involved in piracy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strengthen co-ordination between Flag States, the private sector and military responders to prepare for potential hostage situations; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage implementation of anti-piracy measures, including greater compliance with Best Management Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s conclusions from the Piracy Ransoms Task Force are a welcome step in the right direction. International action, led by the UK, is starting to beat back in the global fight against piracy. The dramatic reduction in pirate activity in the past year shows how important collective action is, and the recommendations of the Task Force should make it harder for pirates to receive, and to profit from, ransom payments. But seafarers of all nations remain at risk, and we must continue to work to break the piracy business model, with the ultimate ambition of bringing an end to ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK Government firmly supports and endorses the conclusions of the Piracy Ransoms Task Force. Only through the international community working together to break the pirates’ business model will we reach a position whereby pirates are no longer able to receive or profit from ransom payments. The Government will continue to work as a leading member of the Contact Group and with industry in taking forward the implementation of the task force’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-affairs-council-and-general-affairs-council"/>
    <title>Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, and I will attend the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-russia-summit"&gt;EU-Russia Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the EU-Russia Summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. Whilst I do not expect conclusions to be issued, we will aim to ensure that this meeting, the 30th such summit, delivers concrete results for the EU in its relationship with Russia. The discussion provides an opportunity for the UK to steer the EU’s objectives for the Summit and to ensure discussion focuses on concrete achievable outcomes, such as: resolution of the Siberian overflight charges; movement on market reform; positive developments in the energy relationship; underlining Member States’ concerns on human rights and democratic standards; and a more effective Partnership for Modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="western-balkans"&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review the situation in the countries of the Western Balkans, in advance of the discussion of EU enlargement at the GAC the following day. This will be an opportunity to consider the latest developments in the EU-facilitated dialogue between the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo: the UK welcomes the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this and is keen to see further improvement in the relations between the two sides. There may also be some discussion of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the pace of reform has recently slowed and renewed progress is badly needed, as well as consideration of the situations in Macedonia and Albania. I do not expect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a discussion on Syria. Further to a UK drive to increase EU support to Syrian civil society, I anticipate that the EEAS will present its vision on how the EU can support civil society in coping with the consequences of the ongoing conflict and better prepare it for political transition. We also expect discussion on the relationship between EU Member States and the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. Having successfully amended the EU arms embargo (and sanctions package) by setting a three-month renewal period, we will make fresh arguments in support of amending the arms embargo ahead of the March 2013 deadline in a way that offers sufficient flexibility to increase practical support to the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may also take stock of recent events in Libya, including how to support the priorities of the new Prime Minister, Ali Zidan, and his government which has now taken office. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council may discuss events in Egypt following President Mursi’s 22 November Constitutional Declaration. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but we will argue for the EU to respond appropriately to the latest developments and clearly underline support for continued progress towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the Middle East Peace Process will focus on follow-up to the 29 November UN General Assembly Resolution, including the EU’s response to the Israeli decisions to build 3,000 new housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, to unfreeze planning in the area known as E1 and to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority. EU Ministers will also discuss facilitating a rapid return to credible negotiations in order to secure a two-state solution. We will reiterate our condemnation of the Israeli decision, underlining the threat this poses to the two-state solution, and stress the need to continue work to build on the May FAC conclusions. We will also emphasise the need for the US, with the strong and active support of the EU, to do all it can in the coming weeks and months to take a decisive lead and push the peace process forward urgently. Additionally the UK will stress the need to build on the Gaza ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons. The UK will support conclusions covering these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-us"&gt;EU-US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item has been re-scheduled from November’s FAC. Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama.  I expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy and a possible EU-US free trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
We also expect Ministers to agree conclusions on Ukraine and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council"&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a substantial agenda for the GAC in December. There is a legislative deliberation on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union; a presentation by the Commission on the Annual Growth Survey; Preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December; endorsement of the 18 month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece; and a discussion on Enlargement, covering all potential candidates and including the adoption of EU Common positions for the Accession Conference with Iceland. Due to the large agenda, I expect many of these items to be brief and I expect most of the discussion to focus on the preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December and on Enlargement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statute-of-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union"&gt;Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency hopes to secure agreement on a selection method for additional judges at the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union: we have not yet received the final proposal for this.  I remain concerned at the current backlog at the General Court, which is damaging to the interests of British business.  My priorities in the discussion will be: to ensure that there is proportionate common law representation among any additional judges; that the costs of additional judges are covered within existing budgets; and that the selection method provides the Court with the stability it requires to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-semester-and-the-annual-growth-survey"&gt;European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present key elements of the 2013 annual growth survey which can be found on the Commission’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual growth survey sets out the Commission’s views on the economic priorities for Europe for 2013, focusing on fiscal consolidation, promoting economic growth and employment. The survey, which represents the first stage of the 2013 European Semester, focuses on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures across the EU.  The European Semester is the EU-wide framework for coordinating structural reforms and growth-enhancing policies. We do not expect this item to be opened for substantive discussion but, in the event that it is, I will be supporting the focus on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-for-the-december-european-council"&gt;Preparation for the December European Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the December European Council will cover: economic policy, including Economic and Monetary Union and Banking Union; defence; enlargement; and foreign policy. The last two items are covered by the separate sections of this Written Ministerial Statement on enlargement and on the Foreign Affairs Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the European Council meeting will focus on agreeing a legislative framework for Banking Union and an agenda for further Economic and Monetary integration in the Eurozone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the December European Council the Prime Minister will seek to ensure the integrity of the Single Market at 27, including in the context of the Banking Union and the European Banking Authority. We will also press for further progress on growth and ensure that the timetable for further integration in the Eurozone progresses at the right pace and in the right way.  I will argue that these concerns should be addressed prior to the December European Council so that solutions to these issues can be put to leaders on 13 and 14 December.
The December European Council agenda item on defence will pave the way for further discussion in 2013.  I will argue for a focus on developing capabilities, enhancing operational effectiveness and strengthening the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-18-month-programme-for-the-presidencies-of-ireland-lithuania-and-greece"&gt;The 18-month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAC has been asked to endorse the 18-month programme of the Council. This sets out the combined programme for the Irish, Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies of the European Council covering the period January 2013 to June 2014. I expect the programme to be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enlargement"&gt;Enlargement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will seek to agree conclusions taking stock of progress on EU enlargement, and on the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans. The Commission released their Annual Enlargement Package on 10 October.  In this communication, the Commission recommended: (i) opening accession negotiations with Macedonia; and (ii) granting Albania candidate status subject to the completion of three specific measures and evidence of continued commitment in the fight against organised crime and corruption. We believe the communication to be a broadly fair and balanced assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek conclusions reconfirming the European Council’s support for EU enlargement and recognising that the accession process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform and reinforces peace, democracy and stability. We agree with the Commission’s view that closer relations with the EU should be based on the principles of delivery on commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality, and good communication with the public. We agree that key challenges remain for most enlargement countries, including in the area of the rule of law. We also support a focus on freedom of expression and regional co-operation, particularly for the Western Balkans countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out the Government’s views on the Commission’s reports in my explanatory memorandum of 18 October. We will seek Council conclusions welcoming Croatia’s continued progress towards meeting all of its commitments in full before its expected accession on 1 July 2013, while reiterating the Commission’s call for Croatia to sharpen its focus to ensure this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will seek conclusions that provide a fair and balanced assessment of Turkey’s progress, which will inject much needed momentum into the process to allow accession negotiations to move forward in 2013. I will argue that Iceland should be commended on the progress made in accession negotiations this year, while recalling the need for Iceland to address existing obligations, such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority under the European Economic Area Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also expect the Council to welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, while calling for early progress in the area of the rule of law, in line with the new approach to accession negotiations endorsed by the Council in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the FAC discussion of 10 December, the GAC will discuss the Commission’s enlargement package for the Western Balkans countries. We remain fully supportive of a future for all of the Western Balkans countries in the EU, once conditions are met. We want the European Council to commend good progress on reform in Macedonia through the High Level Accession Dialogue, and hope the European Council will be able to build on this by agreeing to the Commission’s fourth successive recommendation to open accession negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a further report from the Commission, the December European Council will not be in a position to grant candidate status to Albania; we will want it to call on Albania to make early progress on reform implementation and establish a track record on tackling organised crime and corruption to enable a decision in 2013. I will argue for Council conclusions that underline that Serbia still needs to make real progress to deliver a “visible and sustainable improvement” in its relations with Pristina before accession negotiations can be opened, while noting that this remains in reach if recent progress continues.  We want the Council to welcome the Commission’s assessment that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo is feasible and to signal that negotiations should begin as soon as possible.  We agree with the Commission’s assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on its EU agenda has stalled. We will want the Council to press the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress and deliver quickly on those issues they themselves have agreed to, for example, on the EU road map agreed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Monmouth sharpens skills for the Gulf</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plymouth-based Type 23 frigate and crew of 215 left Plymouth last month and will be policing busy shipping lanes in the Gulf crucial to maritime trade in order to disrupt and deter piracy and other illegal activities at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the ship at a high level of readiness takes a lot of training and hard work, so, during the ship’s transit to the region, the crew have been taking part in a wide variety of physical and military exercises to keep themselves ready for operational duties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A period in the eastern Mediterranean allowed the weapon engineering department to take advantage of a NATO training exercise in Crete and prove the accuracy of all sensors and weapon systems on board. This also allowed the ship’s Royal Navy and Royal Marines boarding teams to participate in multiple boarding exercises with Greek forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One dramatic element of the training was ‘fast roping’ down to the ship from a Lynx helicopter operated and maintained by members of the ship’s flight from 815 Naval Air Squadron, who are embarked for the deployment. The warfare department also provided gun shoots and small-arms firings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marine White takes part in a continuation shoot on board HMS Monmouth whilst transiting the Mediterranean en route to the Gulf " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1587/HMS_Monmouth_sharpens_skills_for_the_Gulf2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Marine White takes part in a continuation shoot on board HMS Monmouth whilst transiting the Mediterranean en route to the Gulf [Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Ben Shread, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While shooting, fast roping and simulated boarding of small boats took place above deck, the chefs were busy cooking meals for the ship’s company but still found the time to make a replica chocolate version of Nelson’s flagship Victory for the wardroom’s Trafalgar Night dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sailors themselves are also being put through their paces by Leading Physical Trainer Danny Card who has been running boxing circuits and early morning workouts each day to keep them fighting fit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Almost 100 per cent of the ship’s company are in date for their standard fitness test and the majority are highly motivated to get fitter during the deployment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high demand for lots of different types of fitness training, with every range of fitness represented taking part in physical exercise on board each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This busy period for the ship’s company supplements the months of operational training they had before leaving the UK - the crew of HMS Monmouth is ready in all respects if called into action in the patrol area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister for Africa highlights risk of kidnap to British nationals in Sahel region</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds detailed how the kidnap threat to western travellers in Mali and some neighbouring areas had grown as a result of instability in the region.  He reinforced how seriously the British Government takes the threat to British nationals overseas. Foreign Office officials asked the industry to highlight the risks and consider alternative options where travellers can still find adventure, but be safe too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Simmonds said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The British government takes the threat to British nationals overseas extremely seriously.  We urge tour operators, including rally organisers, to work with us to make sure that British nationals are fully aware of the serious risks involved in travelling to these areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The terrorist groups Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) and the splinter group, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, pose the greatest kidnap threat. Since the recent coup in Mali, both groups have increased their operational reach and have proven capability to travel long distances to kidnap victims.  They have also been known to use criminal gangs to conduct attacks and pass hostages to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Attacks have taken place in Mali, Niger, Mauritania and Algeria. We also assess that they have operational reach into the north of Burkina Faso and southern Libya and I am sorry to say that the situation is likely to still get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mod-supports-get-safe-online-week"/>
    <title>MOD supports 'Get Safe Online Week'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new document has been released by the Department in support of the campaign, providing guidance for staff on communicating using social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube so they don’t do or say things that bring themselves and their Service into disrepute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the awareness week, the MOD is rerunning videos from last year’s ‘Think Before You…’ campaign on our social media channels. ‘Think Before You…’ is a reminder that personal and operational security should be a primary concern and that social media merely provides a different context where sensitive details can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the Defence Staff’s (CDS’s) Strategic Communications Officer said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Social media has enabled our personnel to stay in touch with their families and their friends no matter where they are in the world. We want our men and women to embrace the use of sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube, but also want them to be aware of the risks that sharing too much information may pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You don’t always know who else is watching in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The MOD Headquarters has its own Facebook, YouTube and Twitter feeds and we see no reason to stop our personnel from tweeting or posting on their own walls. But the MOD has a responsibility to warn personnel of the risks they could be exposing themselves to, hence the launch of this new campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDS’s Strategic Communications Officer added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We do not want to scare Service personnel, families and veterans and we certainly do not want them to stop using social media. We are not here to gag people because we acknowledge the ubiquity and significant benefits that social media offers to people and the MOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of Facebook and Twitter and I use them on a regular basis. These channels are vital to communicating in a digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks to Service personnel - and potentially their families - include posting details and locations of troop movements and operational events, locations and travel details of ships or aircraft, and people’s home addresses. If inadvertently released, information such as this could give the UK’s enemies the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airborne supply experts train for rapid reaction role</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of Colchester-based 13 Air Assault Support Regiment Royal Logistic Corps (13 AA Sp Regt RLC) is to supply ammunition, food, fuel and spare parts to 16 Air Assault Brigade’s Air Assault Task Force (AATF), which is ready to deploy anywhere in the world at short notice to do anything from disaster relief to war-fighting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training in Norfolk placed troops six weeks into an operation, with heavy equipment having arrived in support of an initial airborne assault. The former RAF base at Sculthorpe had been established as a logistics base to supply infantry operations 30 miles (48km) away, near Thetford, with supply depots, workshops and accommodation set up in derelict hangars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Vehicle mechanics of 7 Air Assault Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers at work during Exercise Active Chariot" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1562/Airborne_supply_experts_train_for_rapid_reaction_role2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[Picture: Corporal Obi Igbo, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Alistair Hamilton said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can insert logistics troops and supplies by parachute during the early phases of an operation and build from there. As more troops and kit arrive it makes for more complex logistical challenges as the demand for supplies rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve been practising how supplies get to us, such as airborne drops from Hercules transport aircraft, how we get supplies forward using helicopters and lorries, and how we run distribution points to give the supplies to the troops that need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigging vehicles to be carried under helicopters is a key skill that troops have practised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private Michael Lewis said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rigging is all about keeping a load balanced. We do a lot of classroom work to learn the principles and practise preparing different vehicles and loads, but there’s nothing like doing it with a helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as their core logistic role the unit was tested with mock attacks on the base, including countering the threat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Hamilton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This has been good training to get all of our skills and drills right, but also to train the units we’re supporting in what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 Field Company, 7 Air Assault Battalion Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, which is responsible for maintaining the AATF’s vehicles, weapons and electronic equipment, also operated from Sculthorpe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit sent teams out to repair equipment in the field or bring it back to Sculthorpe for more complicated work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lance Corporal Tom Walker said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve been given some tough repairs to do without the spares and tools there are in barracks. Our soldiering has been tested too, with guard duty in CBRN kit a new experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training was carried out in parallel with Exercise Active Eagle that tested the fieldcraft of 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, the AATF’s main infantry unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>HMS Sutherland's top gunners fend off French top guns</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Devonport-based frigate came under ‘attack’ from a pair of French Mirage jets of 3/11 Course Squadron based in Djibouti during air defence training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At high altitude the Mirages can notch up speeds in excess of 1,500mph (2,400km/h) - more than twice the speed of sound. At low level, they’re limited to a little under 690mph (1,110km/h), whereas Sutherland can get up to 39.5mph flat-out (34 knots or 64km/h) - achieved during speed trials back in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its top low-altitude speed, a Mirage will eat up 1,012 feet (308m) every second - which gives gunners like Able Seaman Herring three seconds to react; the range of the minigun - a Gatling gun which spews out up to 6,000 rounds a minute - is a little over 3,000 feet (914m).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training, known in military parlance as an ADEX (Air Defence Exercise), came about thanks to the personal touch; a couple of French pilots came aboard the frigate when she took a break from her patrols to take on supplies, and thus the seeds were sown for a ‘workout’ which tested airmen and sailors alike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was fantastic training for the entire ship’s company - we practised our core war-fighting skills in the operations room, ship handling from the bridge, and there was battle damage overlaid to test the entire ship’s company,” said Sutherland’s Operations Officer Lieutenant Commander Tom Westwood.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Mirages carried out simulated missile raids and bombing attacks for an hour. Sutherland defeated each incoming raid and manoeuvred aggressively to ensure all her weapons and sensors could engage the targets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Mirage pilots commented on the difficulty they faced attacking the ship due to her manoeuvres and the skill of the ship’s company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will though be back to give it another go; Sutherland intends to repeat the exercise with the French when she’s next in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not merely the gunners aboard the ship who’ve been tested recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short visit to the Omani capital of Muscat, the frigate headed out into the Gulf of Oman to join US forces for a three-day submarine hunt as Sutherland and the Arleigh Burke Class destroyer USS Nitze tried to find an American hunter-killer boat lurking somewhere below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the Devonport-based frigate could call upon the ship’s Merlin, call-sign ‘Warlock’, to track down the ‘foe’; the helicopter is widely acknowledged in naval circles as the best there is at sub-hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Merlin crew, who’ve devoted most of the deployment to maritime security and board and search operations with Sutherland’s Royal Marines Commando detachment, a spot of ‘pinging’ was a welcome return to the helicopter’s raison d’etre:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The anti-submarine exercise allowed us to refresh and refine our core and advanced anti-submarine warfare skills in challenging environmental conditions,” said Merlin Flight Commander Lieutenant Earl Kingston.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It was the perfect opportunity for my team to adjust our traditional tactics - normally employed in more temperate climes - to the unique oceanography of this region.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And it allowed us to work closely with our American cousins and make use of their submarine, so we gained an insight into the different tactics they employ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the exercise Sutherland and Nitze conducted a simultaneous fuel replenishment at sea with the aptly-named USNS Supply, an American fast combat support ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sutherland will continue her wide-ranging mission - a combination of keeping the sea lanes open for lawful usage by mariners and working with friendly nations and navies in the region - until the year’s end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>UK-Italy statement on counter terrorism co-operation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Minister Terzi and Foreign Secretary Hague discussed the continued threat facing the United Kingdom and Italy from terrorism, so tragically underlined by events in Nigeria two weeks ago.  We confirmed our intention to intensify our already close co-operation and consultation in this area and agreed to establish a UK-Italy High Level Group on terrorism to oversee this work. This Group will meet at senior official level, and will look at the full range of our co-operation on counter-terrorism and related issues, including counter-kidnap, piracy, radicalisation, Yemen, Somalia and Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have agreed today to pursue the following areas of joint activity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the tragic deaths of Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara in Nigeria two weeks ago, we will support further work to build regional capacity to tackle the kidnap threat posed by terrorist groups, who operate across borders and target victims regardless of nationality.  As a first step, the UK and Italy will consider how best to help strengthen Nigeria’s capacity to tackle the threat posed by terrorism, including through support to regional law enforcement and security co-ordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been at the forefront of the international effort to protect the people of Libya during their struggle for change, the UK and Italy share a common desire to help build a stable and secure future for that country. We will offer further support to the Libyan authorities to prevent terrorists from taking advantage of the proliferation of arms and fighters in Libya and the wider region following the Libyan conflict.  Identifying and understanding these threats will be essential in supporting Libya and its neighbours in their efforts to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in Yemen, we have agreed to explore joint co-operation in the policing and justice reform sector.  As progress is made by the Government of Yemen in pushing Al Qaeda out of Yemen, it is important to ensure that civilian police fill the vacuum left behind.  The UK and Italy have important experience in this area.  The challenge is significant and we will work closely with our EU and other partners to support the Yemeni Government as they train police and improve justice capacity throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Joint UK-Italian statement on hostage rescue operation in Nigeria</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi di Sant’Agata met earlier today at the informal Foreign Ministers meeting in Copenhagen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They discussed the recent hostage rescue operation in Nigeria following yesterday’s conversation between Prime Ministers Monti and Cameron.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Hague made clear that there had been a limited opportunity to secure the release of the two hostages whose lives were in imminent and growing danger.  Under these circumstances it was only possible to inform Italy once the operation was already getting underway.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Terzi expressed deep sorrow and disappointment over the tragic outcome of the operation and both ministers agreed on the urgency of sharing full information to facilitate the reconstruction and understanding of these events.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers conveyed their solidarity and sympathy for the families of Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara.  They reaffirmed that the UK and Italy will continue to work together closely in the fight against such horrific terrorism and hostage-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Royal Navy helps reduce Somali pirate activity</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Northwood writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Eleven pirates on board with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. All comms on ship are down. Crew safe in engine room and have control of engine and steering. Please help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message was contained in a plastic water bottle thrown into the Indian Ocean by a member of the security team on board the Italian Merchant Vessel Montecristo, which the previous day had been boarded by Somali pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperate times require desperate measures and, in this age of satellites, radar and computers, calling for help via a message in a bottle certainly qualifies as an act of desperation. The security team had attached a strobe light to the bottle, which, fortunately for the 23 Montecristo crew members, was picked up by a US frigate, De Wert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not far from her was our ship, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria, equipped with a Royal Navy helicopter and Royal Marine boarding teams. We were able to answer the master of Montecristo’s plea for help, recapture his ship from the pirates, and return it to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="The gunner on HMS Somerset's Merlin helicopter fires shots across the bow of a pirated dhow " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1964/Royal_Navy_helps_reduce_Somali_pirate_activity2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The gunner on HMS Somerset's Merlin helicopter fires shots across the bow of a pirated dhow pi[Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Kyle Heller and LA (Phot) Dave Jenkins, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15 Somalis we detained are now in Italian custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montecristo was lucky; lucky that Fort Victoria could cross 550 miles [885km] of Indian Ocean, the distance from Portsmouth to Edinburgh, before the pirates broke into the crew safe area or ‘citadel’. But she also made her own luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was well prepared for her transit of the Indian Ocean with razor wire defences of her upper decks and superstructure. These at least slowed the pirates down as they boarded the vessel and gave the crew and their unarmed security team time to retreat and barricade themselves into the engine room, and wait for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montecristo incident is the Somali piracy problem and some of its solutions in microcosm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago Somali pirates were a regular feature in the news. The number of attacks on merchant vessels was in double figures each month and the number of vessels held by the Somalis for ransom had increased to more than 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of Somali piracy in 2008 caught people by surprise, and there was a strong sense that nothing could be done to defeat the pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no obvious solution to the problems of Somalia ashore, the huge distances involved made it difficult for military forces to protect merchant vessels effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give some idea of scale, in the four months that Fort Victoria was at sea she operated in an area the size of western Europe, patrolling a front 2,300 miles [3,700km] long - the distance from Berlin to Moscow - and steaming a total of 27,000 miles [43,500km].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something has been done and the past few months have seen a significant reversal of fortunes. Attacks on merchant vessels are down by 80 per cent and today there are only a handful of vessels held captive off the Somali coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most merchant vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden are now employing armed and unarmed security teams, along with other protection measures. Collectively this description of merchant ship self-protection goes by the mundane name of ‘industry best management practice’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these measures work. In most cases they prevent the pirates successfully boarding vessels. This enables the patrolling naval forces to locate the attacking pirate vessels and detain the Somalis for prosecution. All this has served to set back Somali piracy activity to 2007 levels and to reduce their cashflow significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are tactical successes that must be viewed in the context of a much bigger strategic picture. They depend on a far wider network of operations involving politicians, commercial shipping and other agencies. When Fort Victoria recently captured 14 Somali pirates we were able to take them to the Seychelles for prosecution. Thanks to the support of the British High Commissioner to the Seychelles and his strong relations with members of its government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is an even bigger strategic picture. The pressure put on pirates by military success has created headroom for those tackling the more intractable issues of governance ashore in Somalia. This week’s Somalia Conference in London marks the next stage in restoring calm to the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Royal Navy returns pirated dhow to owner</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yemeni fishing dhow, which was recovered from the suspected Somali pirates on Friday 13 January 2012, had been hijacked and held in a known pirate camp ashore. Awadh Barasheed, the owner of the dhow, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am happy to receive my dhow back after being pirated since 18 May 2011. I would like to thank the coalition forces and specifically the British Navy for retrieving my dhow from the hands of the criminal pirates. This dhow is the only source of income for me, my brothers and our families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel embarked on RFA Fort Victoria were able to hand back the dhow in international waters in the Gulf of Aden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Gerry Northwood, Royal Navy, Commander of the UK Counter-Piracy Task Group, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dhow was handed to the captain of Yemeni Navy ship 1031 and the agent acting on behalf of the dhow’s owner. This was an excellent example of the Royal Navy and the Yemeni Navy working together for the common good of the local maritime community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Captain Gerry Northwood presents a plaque to the captain of Yemeni Navy ship 1031 " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1967/Royal_Navy_returns_pirated_dhow_to_owner2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Captain Gerry Northwood presents a plaque to the captain of Yemeni Navy ship 1031 [Picture: LA(Phot) Kyle Heller, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Saleh Bayumain, Chairman of the Dhow Owners Association of Mukalla, passed a message back to the Yemeni Liaison Officer based at Combined Maritime Forces headquarters to express his own appreciation of the Royal Navy, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are happy to see a member of our association is getting back to business. On behalf of all dhow owners of Mukalla I would like to express my gratitude to the commander of the British naval ship and his dedicated and noble crew members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My thanks also extend to all the maritime forces who patrol the area and fight piracy; they have helped us on many occasions and provided help in terms of food, water, fuel and mechanical support. Thanks also to our Navy and Coast Guard who followed up with this issue from the beginning and co-ordinated the delivery of the dhow to its owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008 the Royal Navy has been actively assisting the local maritime community in the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean through international counter-piracy efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NATO-led counter-piracy task force conducts routine visits to local ships, merchant vessels and fishing dhows going about their lawful business in international waters to confirm that they are safe and to reassure them that the international maritime forces are in the area as a force for good, to protect them from pirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Northwood added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was pleased that we were able to return the dhow to its rightful owner. It is important that through our co-operation with the Yemeni Navy we reassure the local maritime community that we are able to protect their interests. They are as much the victims of Somali piracy as the larger international ships navigating through the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFA Fort Victoria has been acting as part of a NATO task group in support of Operation OCEAN SHIELD. In the past ten days, five pirate groups have been successfully disrupted in the Gulf of Aden and over fifty pirates are potentially facing the prospect of prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Kenya travel advice update</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice for Kenya.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We advise against all but essential travel to within 60km of the Somali border, to coastal areas within 150km of the Kenya-Somalia border (this includes the Lamu area), to Garissa district and to low income areas of Nairobi, including all township or slum areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kenyan authorities have alerted the public to a heightened threat from terrorist attacks in Nairobi. We believe that terrorists may be in the final stages of planning attacks. Attacks could be indiscriminate and target Kenyan institutions as well as places where expatriates and foreign travellers gather, such as hotels, shopping centres and beaches. We strongly advise British Nationals to exercise extra vigilance and caution in public places and at public events.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FCO Travel Advice is kept under constant review.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and make further updates as necessary. Further details can be found in the updated &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/kenya1"&gt;travel advice on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary welcomes FAC report on piracy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement today, the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome the Foreign Affairs Committeepira report into Piracy off the coast of Somalia. Somali piracy has grown into a major international problem, exacerbating the wider challenges we face in helping Somalia recover from conflict and drought. We will use the London Conference on Somalia to chart a way forward on the future political direction of Somalia, the vital humanitarian effort and the international community’s approach to tackling piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I particularly welcome the FAC’s clear support for our military engagement in the Gulf of Aden and in the wider Indian Ocean, for our position on establishing an extra-territorial Somali court, and policy of prosecuting pirates in local courts and our prisoner transfer agreements. Britain will continue to work with the UN, African Union, regional partners and the Somali people to build a stable Somalia and through our work with DFID to build sustainable alternative livelihoods for coastal communities in Somalia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Sir William Patey gave an exclusive interview to Tolo News TV on 29 October</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is obvious, the Haqqani network is behind the attacks in Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan, therefore we are holding talks with Pakistan to convince Pakistani officials to take tougher action against the Haqqani network in Pakistan. We need to hold talks with Pakistani officials on ISI’s possible links with the Haqqani network. We need more cooperation to deal with this menace. The US authorities have changed their previous harsh stance towards Pakistan. What is significant is a joint war against the insurgents in the region. It is clear that there are insurgent groups in Pakistan infiltrating Afghanistan and vice versa. Instability in the region can affect both Afghanistan and Pakistan. I think the accusations against Pakistan should be assessed. Pakistan can play a key role in finding an inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan. Pakistan and Afghanistan should have a frank dialogue,” British Ambassador William Patey said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He denied commenting on the Pakistani government’s support for Haqqani network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This issue is not clear. I am not getting into the Pakistani government’s relations with the Haqqani network. Speculating about this issue could not be correct. We need confidence-building between Afghanistan and Pakistan to put and end to the activity of the Haqqani network’s insurgents in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked whether the UK government has evidence about Pakistan’s support for insurgents, the British ambassador said that obviously the Taleban have bases in Pakistan’s border areas, but Pakistani forces are engaged in battles with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: “Pakistanis say they do not have full control over some areas in Pakistan’s tribal belt. They are fighting insurgents there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to why the NATO forces are not taking action against insurgents on the other side of the border [in Pakistan] William Patey said that they have carried out some joint raids against specific targets [in Pakistan].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It will not be a good idea to get engaged in fighting with Pakistan. I don’t think such a move could resolve the Afghan issue. Terrorists have bases not only in Pakistan, but they are also operating and have bases in Afghanistan. I do not rule out insurgents’ presence on both sides of the border. There is no disagreement on joint cooperation and fighting terrorists’ networks in the region,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touching on the issue of a possible US military operation inside Pakistan, the British envoy said that the British forces would not take part in any possible unilateral US military action against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about his stance about the Afghan president’s remarks on backing Pakistan if it were attacked by the US, William Patey said that the Afghan president’s remarks conveys a message to Pakistan that Afghanistan’s strategic agreement with the US should not be regarded as a threat against Pakistan.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Afghan peace talks&lt;br&gt;
**The UK envoy supported the Afghan president’s stance on holding peace talks with the Pakistani government rather than with the Taleban, after the assassination of the chairman of the Afghan High Peace Council, Borhanoddin Rabbani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: “The Afghan president sent a signal to the Taleban, after Rabbani’s assassination, telling them that government is no more willing to hold talks with them, unless they are fully ready. Wars end through dialogue.”&lt;br&gt;
He went on to say that they had contacts with the Taleban members coordinated with the Afghan government in order to ensure stability in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have had interactions with Mullah Zaeef [former Taleban ambassador to Pakistan]. Mullah Zaeef and a publisher of his book were in London. On his visit to London, we prepared the ground for a meeting between Mullah Zaeef and some officials. I met Mullah Zaeef in London. We sent messages to the Taleban, telling them that we are ready for talks with them,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Second Bonn conference on Afghanistan&lt;br&gt;
**William Patey expressed optimism about the upcoming second Bonn Conference on Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will reiterate our commitments to support the Afghan government and the Afghan forces after 2014 at the Bonn conference. Our objective at the Bonn conference is to show that the end of our combat mission and departure of our forces from Afghanistan in 2014 is not an end of all our missions in Afghanistan - we will only change the method of our cooperation with Afghanistan. We will continue our training role in Afghanistan after our troops’ drawdown. We will remain in Afghanistan to support and improve Afghanistan’s education, health care and governance sectors.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Corruption in Afghan government&lt;br&gt;
**The British ambassador called for joint struggle against corruption in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some decisions of the Kabul conference, including spending international aid through the Afghan government have not been successfully implemented, because of Afghanistan’s poor financial system and the Kabul Bank crisis. The British government also did not provide financial aid directly to the Afghan government,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that the government had made progress in resolving the Kabul Bank crisis, preparing the ground for the IMF to resume its aid to Afghanistan. Touching on corruption in the Afghan government the British ambassador said that the Afghan government should fulfill its commitments made at the Kabul international conference, on tackling corruption in the government institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are also cooperating with the Afghan government in fighting corruption. It is a bilateral process,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**British-Afghan strategic agreement and British troops’ role in Afghanistan&lt;br&gt;
**Asked whether Britain is willing to sign a strategic agreement with Afghanistan, Willian Patey said that they were negotiating with the Afghan government a long-term strategic cooperation agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are close to reaching agreement. Such agreement would give confidence to the Afghan people that we are not leaving them,” he answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that the British government has decided to reduce the number of British forces in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have had 10,000 British troops here cooperating with the Afghan people over the past ten years. We will commence reducing the number of our forces - their gradual departure will begin this year. The UK prime minister has announced that they will pull out 400 soldiers this year and 500 soldiers in the coming year. No British combat troops will remain Afghanistan after 2014,” the British ambassador said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He denied a WikiLeaks’ report about the Afghan president’s criticism of British forces in Sangin District of southern Helmand Province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said: “The Afghan president has not shared such a thing with me, but the Afghan president has told me that British forces were able to stabilize the areas under their control in Helmand. We did not have a sufficient number of soldiers in Helmand, therefore US army units were deployed in some parts of Helmand Province. It is a joint mission. You cannot say the American forces are better than the British troops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of a British military commanders’ peace deal with the Taleban in Musa Qala District of Helmand Province three years ago, William Patey said that such things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: “We did not have enough troops in Musa Qala to stabilize the area. We have increased the number of our troops in Helmand now, broadening our cooperation with the Afghan forces. The points you raised about Musa Qala is a three-year-old story. The improvements in Helmand are the result of our joint efforts in cooperation with the Afghans.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Poppy cultivation in Helmand&lt;br&gt;
**The British ambassador said that presence of British troops in Helmand has nothing to do with the rising poppy cultivation in that province. He added that it is a joint challenge facing the Afghan government and international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You should judge differently, you should take our efforts in preventing poppy cultivation over the past years into consideration. It is not an easy task to eradicate poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. The Taleban are deliberately supporting poppy cultivation in Afghanistan in order to fund their war against our forces and the government of Afghanistan,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that the Afghans should themselves deal and resolve their challenges that are part of the legacy of three decades of war.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-office-minister-hosts-first-ever-uk-vietnam-strategic-dialogue"/>
    <title>Foreign Office Minister hosts first ever UK-Vietnam strategic dialogue</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministers shared their views on global and regional security developments, including EU ASEAN relations, the South China Sea and the Arab Spring, as well as defence and organised international crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Dialogue, the Foreign Office Minister said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I visited Vietnam earlier this year, I was struck by its energy, drive and rapid development. This is a fast-growing economy and one that is expected to grow by more than seven per cent a year by 2015. I want this same energy to be brought to the UK-Vietnam relationship, so that it can develop and thrive in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Vietnam is an important partner for the UK on commercial issues and, increasingly, on global and regional issues. This is what the meeting today is focusing on and I hope that through our discussions we will find more ways of working together and more opportunities for both of our countries.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time a Strategic Dialogue has been held between the two countries, and marks a new commitment to strengthen bilateral relationships following the Strategic Partnership Agreement  signed in September 2010. Other aspects of strengthened bilateral relations under the Strategic Partnership include an MoU signed on 25 October between the UK’s Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) and the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam (DAV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Dialogue comes at a time when the UK and Vietnam are already working closely on a range of long-term issues including climate change, development and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of investing in Vietnam is also becoming more widespread amongst UK businesses, with a recent survey by UK Trade &amp;amp; Investment (UKTI) showing that Vietnam is the second most popular investment destination, after China, in terms of emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full text of the communique:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FCO Minister of State Jeremy Browne and MOFA Vice Minister Bui Thanh Son, accompanied by senior officials from the UK Ministry of Defence and the Home Office and the Vietnamese Ministries of National Defence and Public Security, conducted the inaugural Vietnam-UK Strategic Dialogue meeting in London on 26 October 2011.  This realised the commitment made by the two governments in the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in September 2010. The Strategic Dialogue encompassed discussions on bilateral issues, including defence, organised crime and counter terrorism, as well as regional security. The Strategic Dialogue came the week before the fifth meeting in Hanoi of the UK-Vietnam Joint Economic and Trade Committee chaired by the UK Minister of Business, Innovation and Skills and the Vietnam Minister of Industry and Trade, which both parties hoped would help to further develop and deepen economic and commercial ties.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides noted with satisfaction that bilateral relations continue to be strengthened and broadened effectively in 7 areas mentioned in the Strategic Partnership Agreement. In this regard Vietnam reaffirmed its intention to proceed with a proactive and deeper international integration policy. Elevating bilateral relations with the UK through the Strategic Partnership was an important element of this policy. The UK welcomed Vietnam’s intention and also reaffirmed its own commitment to broadening and deepening its relations with Vietnam and the Asia Pacific as a whole. The UK underlined its commitment to further support work in Vietnam on good governance, accountability, transparency and human rights. In order to further enhance the bilateral Strategic Partnership, the UK warmly welcomes the official visit to the UK by the Chairman of the Vietnam National Assembly in early December 2011. Vietnam reiterated PM Nguyen Tan Dung’s invitation to PM David Cameron to make an official visit to Vietnam.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On regional security, Minister of State Jeremy Browne noted the important and growing role that ASEAN and other ASEAN-led regional mechanisms had to play and welcomed the catalytic role that Vietnam had played during its Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2010. The UK looked forward to signing the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Vietnam welcomed the UK’s signal of its intent and agreed to actively support an EU role in the region.  The two sides also discussed the situation in the South China Sea/East Sea. Both sides acknowledged that the maintenance of peace, stability, safety, and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea/East Sea is in the common interests of the international community. The UK was concerned by tensions in this vital global trade artery and expressed its hope that all parties can resolve all territorial disputes in the South China Sea/East Sea peacefully, in line with international law. The two sides reaffirmed the importance of the 2002 ASEAN - China Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea/East Sea and encouraged the parties to reach an agreement on a code of conduct. The two sides also exchanged understandings on broader geopolitical dynamics of economic power and security.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On defence, the two sides shared views and concerns over existing conflicts and emerging threats and discussed international and multilateral responses and how the two nations could cooperate more closely to minimise threats. The UK welcomed Vietnam’s potential future contribution to UN Peacekeeping Operations. On the bilateral front, the Ministers looked forward to closer defence cooperation, including more frequent exchange of delegations and the signing of an MoU on defence cooperation. Counter-proliferation, nuclear security and other non-traditional security challenges were discussed, with both sides strongly reaffirming the importance of countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction which would destabilise global peace and security. Both sides underlined the importance of making tangible progress on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation to fulfil the commitments set out in the 2010 NPT Action Plan, towards our shared long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons. The two sides also reiterated the importance of preventing nuclear material and know-how falling into the hands of terrorists. The UK and Vietnam agreed to cooperate on a range of international initiatives such as the Nuclear Security Summit and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Vietnam informed of the steps taken to sign and ratify the amended Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The UK also committed to working with Vietnam to develop civil nuclear capacity in pursuit of the legitimate development of clean energy to support its impressive economic growth.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On international organised crime and counter terrorism, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to working together to counter these global threats. The UK welcomes the participation of Vietnam in the London Cyber conference due to take place in early November. Other forms of organised crime including human trafficking and money laundering were also discussed, with both Ministers welcoming the existing cooperation between their two countries and looking forward to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on immigration information exchange. The UK and Vietnam also discussed the UN Convention against Trans-national Organised Crime and the Palermo Protocols on human trafficking and people smuggling. In closing, the two Ministers agreed that Security and Defence would remain a key pillar of the Strategic Partnership and looked forward to ever closer dialogue in the coming months in the spirit of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary welcomes EU sanctions following assassination plot in the US</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking today he said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome the EU’s agreement to impose restrictive measures on five individuals following the disrupted plot  to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to  the US.  The EU action follows the UK’s designations earlier this week under the Terrorist Asset Freezing Act 2010.  The EU measures will impose  an EU-wide financial assets freeze and prevent any funds being made available to the individuals concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The assassination plot appears to constitute a escalation in Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism outside its borders.  This coordinated EU action sends a strong message that EU Member States will not tolerate Iranian involvement in terrorism and underlines both the gravity of the plot, and the serious consequences it could have had if it had been successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The names of the individuals concerned will be published on the website of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm"&gt;Official Journal of the EU&lt;/a&gt; on 22 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary visits Mauritania</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the end of his visit to Mauritania, Foreign Secretary William Hague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a pleasure to visit Mauritania. This is the first visit ever by a British Foreign Secretary. It is a sign of our interest in a closer partnership with Mauritania over the coming years, and of Mauritania’s growing role in regional issues, as well as foreign policy as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wish to engage with Mauritania as serious partners in security and foreign policy. Mauritania is in the frontline of the growing security threat from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and is an important partner for discussions on Libya, Cote d’Ivoire and wider African issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But the purpose of my visit was not just to discuss security. We are looking at ways we can help Mauritania on political reform, good governance and human rights, all of which are essential to Mauritania’s future development. I discussed the potential for UK support through our Arab Partnership Initiative, which offers practical expertise and funding to strengthen political participation, civil society and other building blocks of open democratic societies. The lesson of the Arab Spring is that demands for political freedom and economic development will grow, and we wish to help our partners who are seeking to meet the aspirations of their people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I also discussed the potential for an expanded economic relationship between Britain and Mauritania, as well as our support for greater trade between Europe and the Maghreb and the countries of the region themselves. This could transform the economic prospects of Mauritania and its neighbours, and underpins democratic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For all these reasons this was an important and landmark visit and we look forward to building on the cooperation we have established today. As a sign of this we are delighted that Mauritania has expressed its intention to reopen an Embassy in London.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary visits Algeria</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague has arrived in Algeria on the final stop of a tour of North Africa designed to increase British engagement and economic ties in this crucial region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit, the first by a British Foreign Secretary since February 2006, comes at a time of considerable change across North Africa. As the largest economy and most populous country in the Maghreb, Algeria will play a key role in the future prosperity and stability of the region. It has introduced some political reforms ahead of next year’s elections, and this will be a significant topic of discussion during the visit. The Arab Spring also offers opportunities for greater regional integration to the benefit of Algeria, its neighbours and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary will meet President Bouteflika and Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci. He will also hold talks with Algerian civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on arrival, the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am very pleased to visit Algeria at such an important time for the country and the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All governments in the region have a strong interest in creating more open societies, greater political freedom and stronger economic development, as they seek to meet the aspirations of their people.  We welcome the political reforms the government has introduced ahead of next year’s elections. We are supporting these changes through our Arab Partnership programme in the areas of youth employment, civil society capacity building and prison reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will also discuss the situation in Libya with the Algerian government following my visit to Tripoli yesterday. As a neighbour of Libya, Algeria has an important role to play and I will urge the Government to cooperate with the Libyan authorities and the International Criminal Court as they seek to bring to justice indicted members of the former Qadhafi regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Algeria is also an important partner for the UK in counter-terrorism. We will continue to support Algeria in its fight against Al-Qaeda and to encourage a regional approach to this common threat”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary meets Pakistan Foreign Minister</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Secretary William Hague met Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar at the United Nations on Monday 19 September.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was their first face to face meeting since Ms Rabbani Khar was appointed as Pakistani Foreign Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary offered Ms Rabbani Khar condolences on the loss of life in Pakistan’s recent floods and assured her of Britain’s offer of assistance. The Foreign Secretary emphasised Britain’s commitment to assisting Pakistan’s economic growth, including through greater market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two Ministers agreed to meet in London next week and to seek early agreement on a date for the next meeting of the UK/Pakistan Enhanced Strategic Dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary paid tribute to Pakistan’s sacrifices in the struggle against terrorism.  Both Ministers agreed on the importance of UK/Pakistani cooperation against violent extremism. They shared views on the need for a process of political reconciliation in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers looked forward to attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
