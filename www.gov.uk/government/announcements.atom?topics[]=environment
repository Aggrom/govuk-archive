    <title>Abolition of regional strategies</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the Government’s policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London, reflecting manifesto commitments made by both Coalition parties in the 2010 general election and subsequently incorporated into the Coalition Agreement. The Localism Act 2011 provides for the abolition of regional strategies in a two-stage process. The first stage, to remove the regional planning framework and prevent further strategies from being created, took effect when the Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November. The second stage would be to abolish the existing regional strategies by secondary legislation. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects of revocation of each of the existing regional strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Environmental Assessment process is set out in an EU Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In March 2012, the European Court of Justice issued a significant ruling on the interpretation and application of the Directive (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles ASBL &amp;amp; Others v Government of the Brussels-Capital Region).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, and before the decision of the European Court of Justice, there has already been consultation with the statutory consultation bodies on the scope and level of detail of the environmental reports. Public consultation took place between October 2011 and January 2012 on the basis of environmental reports published in October 2011. Detailed responses were provided in the course of this exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, in the light of planning policy and legislation that have been put in place since January 2012, in light of the earlier consultation responses, and in order to be meticulous in observing the requirements of the Directive, the Government is now updating the environmental reports and undertaking additional consultation. We are publishing the first of the updated environmental reports: the report in respect of the proposed &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/strategic-environmental-assessments"&gt;revocation of the East of England Regional Strategy&lt;/a&gt; shortly and will place a copy in the Libraries of both Houses. This report builds on and is intended to supersede the previous report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period for consultation responses will remain open for eight weeks. We welcome and encourage all interested parties to respond. At the end of that period we will consider all consultation responses, including those already submitted during the October 2011 to January 2012 response period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks my Department will publish updated environmental reports relating to the proposals on each of the other regional strategies, so that those proposals too can be the subject of additional consultation. In each case there will be an 8 week period for consultation responses. All updated environmental reports will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed revocation of the Regional Strategies may be regarded as a material consideration by decision makers when determining planning applications and appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In respect of plan-making, the National Planning Policy Framework implementation period provides councils with the incentive to get their plan policies up to date and in doing so they can have regard to the policy to revoke Regional Strategies and the new National Planning Policy Framework policies. A local plan document must be in general conformity with the regional strategy at the stage that the plan is submitted for examination but it is open to councils when preparing local plans to take account of the policy to revoke up to the time of submission. Local authorities can also bring forward proposals (for example on housing targets) which have a local interpretation to them in their plans, based on their own sound evidence base where that is justified by the local circumstances. That evidence base is likely to be more up to date than that included in the Regional Strategies. Each case will depend on its particular facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Next steps to improve the planning system and support sustainable development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further moves to simplify the planning system and make it more accessible to people in communities were set out today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package of measures includes proposals to make it easier to re-use some existing buildings without needing planning permission including the so-called ‘meanwhile’ use of vacant commercial buildings; streamlining the amount of paperwork needed for a planning application; speeding up planning appeal decisions; reducing the volume of planning guidance; and ensuring planning departments are properly resourced to assess applications promptly and efficiently, reducing the burden on council taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the rate at which councils are putting in place a local plan is increasing in comparison to the average over the previous seven years and over 100 local authorities are now working with front-runner communities on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s proposals will help to maintain the rapid pace of reform by removing unnecessary barriers, streamlining paperwork, and supporting swifter decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our reforms to the planning system are making it simpler, clearer and more accessible to people in communities.
&amp;gt; “Following the simplification of the national planning policy in the National Planning Policy Framework, these proposed changes streamline the process of applying for planning permission.
&amp;gt; “Our aim is to have a system that applicants and members of communities can be confident will give a reliable, swift and fair outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making it easier to re-use existing agricultural, retail and commercial buildings, such as offices and warehouses, without the need to submit a planning application, supporting small business growth. A consultation is being published on changes to the Use Classes Order, which determines the flexibility with which such buildings can be re-used. The consultation also proposes allowing so called ‘meanwhile’ or temporary uses of certain buildings to open up premises to new businesses and to bring redundant buildings back into use, in line with recommendations in the Portas Review.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting out unnecessary information in the application process to make the system clearer, and easier to use, without undermining the ability for councils to make well-informed decisions. A consultation setting out proposals is being published today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following the approach of the National Planning Policy Framework in distilling 1,000 pages of policy into around 50, the next challenge is to review around 6,000 pages of supporting planning guidance. Details of the approach to be taken will be announced shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speeding up the process for determining planning appeals - proposals on shortening and streamlining the process will be published for consultation later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uprating local councils’ planning fees in line with inflation thereby reducing the burden on ordinary council taxpayers, who otherwise end up subsidising developers. Planning fees are set by Government and have not been increased since 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring councils whose planning decisions are consistent with an up to date local plan are not ordinarily liable for costs if their decision is appealed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making technical changes to the operation of the Community Infrastructure Levy including ensuring that developers are not charged the levy twice, on the same development, if they amend existing planning consent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending the funding to April 2013 to the four organisations providing advice and support to communities leading the way on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper on allowing greater permitted development rights in changing between Use Classes is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper setting out a range of proposals to streamline the information requirements for planning applications is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from owners or developers of land undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development, including new or safer road schemes, flood defences, park improvements, green spaces and leisure centres. The Government will introduce regulatory changes in the Autumn to improve the operation of the levy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government is proposing to improve the performance of statutory consultees in the planning process by ensuring that there is an effective mechanism for applicants to obtain an award of costs where a statutory consultee has acted unreasonably. A consultation with detailed proposals is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The four organisations providing support on neighbourhood planning are: the Royal Town Planning Institute; the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community; the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England working with the National Association of Local Councils and Locality (the Building Communities Consortium). The further funding will be available until the end of the financial year to enable the four support providers to offer practical and bespoke advice and assistance to those communities leading the way with their neighbourhood plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New look energy advice will help homeowners save money on bills</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New-look Energy Performance Certificate to offer practical advice for improvements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospective homeowners will be given better and clearer advice on making their new homes more eco-friendly, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister unveiled a package of measures to make energy information on properties easier to understand, which if followed could help customers save money on their fuel bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new-look Energy Performance Certificate will give homebuyers clearer information about the energy efficiency of their homes. Alongside the recommendations for improvements, the new certificates will indicate to the consumer whether they can be funded through the Green Deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Domestic Energy Assessors, who compile the Energy Performance Certificates, will have undergone further training to ensure these documents are produced to a consistently high standard and assured advice is given to prospective homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospective buyers and tenants will also be given this energy information much earlier in the buying process, to give them time to plan how they will implement some of the recommendations included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From April, these buyers will also be able to compare the energy performance of their home with that of similar properties, as the National Energy Performance Certificate Register is opened up to public use for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to ensure the data is as secure as possible, companies wanting to use the Register will be required to sign a licensing agreement - which will include strict rules over how the data is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance Certificate has proved useful in putting the efficiency of our homes at the forefront of our minds, but homeowners can often struggle to know how to act on the advice it gives.
&amp;gt; “That’s why we’re giving it a complete redesign, making it clearer and easier to understand and putting the recommendations for improvements into matters of pounds and pence by showing how much consumers could potentially save on their energy bills.
&amp;gt; “And by making the national register of Energy Performance Certificates open to the public, each homeowner will for the first time be able to see how their property compares with others, and where changes could be made so their homes become as eco-friendly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <updated>2012-03-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

    <title>National Planning Policy Framework</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker I would like to make a statement about planning policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted today to be publishing the National Planning Policy Framework and our response to the Communities and Local Government Select Committee Report of the 21 December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our reforms to planning policy have 3 fundamental objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To put unprecedented power in the hands of communities to shape the places in which they live;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To better support growth to give the next generation the chance that our generation has had to have a decent home, and to allow the jobs to be created on which our prosperity depends; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To ensure that the places we cherish - our countryside, towns and cities - are bequeathed to the next generation in a better condition than they are now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve these objectives reform is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade of Regional Spatial Strategies, top-down targets and national planning policy guidance that has swelled beyond reason to over 1000 pages across 44 documents, has led to communities seeing planning as something done to them, rather than &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the planning system has become more complex, it has ground ever slower. In 2004 Parliament required every council to have a plan - eight years on, only around a half have been able to adopt one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last decade - starting long before the financial crisis - we built fewer homes than in any peacetime decade for 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average age of the first-time buyer is approaching 40, and rising rents mean that families have to spend more and more on housing, and less and less on themselves and their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t allow this to go on. To do so would be to deny our responsibility to young families - to tell them that the property-owning democracy was for our generation but not for yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of this is down to sclerosis in the planning system, but some is. The Chambers of Commerce have said that the planning system has become;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;too complicated, too costly, too uncertain. It discourages investment, creates mistrust and holds back our recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not as if what has made it through has made up in quality what it lacks in quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much development in recent years has been mediocre, insensitive and has detracted from the character of the areas in which we live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many of our habitats have been degraded and nature driven out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect has been that much of the public have come to assume that any particular change to our built environment will be negative - that it will tend to impair beauty, damage the environment and make our lives worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a disastrous state of affairs in a country which is home to some of the most talented designers, and the best architects and craftsmen in the world, and which has over the years constructed villages and cities and buildings - like the one we meet in - that people cross the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our reforms to the planning system take on each of these challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They enshrine the local plan - produced by local people - as the keystone of the planning system;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They make planning much simpler and more accessible, reducing over a thousand pages of often impenetrable jargon into around 50 pages of clearly written guidance;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They establish a presumption in favour of sustainable development that means that development is not held up unless to approve it would be against our collective interest;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Framework guarantees robust protections for our natural and historic environment, and goes further by requiring net improvements to put right some of the neglect that has been visited on us;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It raises the bar on design standards so that we have the most exacting requirement for design that the English planning system has ever contained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, I have always regarded reforming the planning system as a serious responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start I made it clear that Parliament should be central to the development of the policy, we have had three full debates in this House and in the House of Lords - and I asked the Communities and Local Government Select Committee to consider the draft National Planning Policy Framework and to give me its considered advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put on record my thanks to the chairman and members of that Committee and to Environmental Audit Committee for the seriousness and thoughtfulness that they brought to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to tell colleagues that of the Committee’s 35 recommendations, I have been able to accept 30 in whole or in part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular the final framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes it clear that the local plan is, as the Committee put it, the keystone of the planning edifice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is crystal clear that sustainable development embraces social and environmental as well as economic objectives and does so in a balanced way;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refers explicitly to the five principles of the UK Sustainable Development Strategy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goes further than ever before and is clear that councils should look for net improvements on all dimensions of sustainability;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes explicit that the presumption in favour of sustainable development works through, not against, local plans;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes it clear that relevant policies - such as those protecting the Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, National Parks and other areas - cannot be overridden by the presumption;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognises the intrinsic value and beauty of the countryside (whether specifically designated or not);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes explicit what was always implicit: that councils’ policies must encourage brownfield sites to be brought back into use;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Underlines the importance of town centres, while recognising that businesses in rural communities should be free to expand;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Takes a localist approach to creating a buffer of housing supply over and above 5 years, and in the use of windfall sites;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows councils to protect back gardens - those precious urban oases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensures that playing fields continue to benefit from that same protection that they do currently;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final framework has been strengthened by the contributions of everyone who has taken the trouble to submit their views and I am very grateful for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always been my intention that councils who have done the right thing and either adopted, or have made good progress towards adopting local plans, will not be disadvantaged by the change to new policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, I have introduced transitional arrangements suggested by, and agreed with, the Local Government Association. They accord weight to plans according to how advanced they are. However, I have gone further in two respects. I have allowed 12 months from today for existing plans to be adjusted to be in complete conformity with the new framework, and made clear that weight can be given to emerging plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Mr Speaker, this House has a particular role to play in safeguarding the interests of our successors. Having shaped the development of the new framework, I will ensure that Parliament supervises the implementation of the policies starting with a debate on the floor of the House soon after we return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, the purpose of planning is to help make the way we live our lives tomorrow better than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This National Planning Policy Framework will help build the homes the next generation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports growth to allow employers to create the jobs our constituents need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It protects what we hold dear in our matchless countryside and in the fabric of our history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does so by taking power away from remote bodies and putting it firmly into the hands of the people of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I warmly commend it to the House.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government takes next step on zero carbon homes</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zero-Carbon Homes are a step closer today after new proposals were announced to cut carbon emissions in new and existing buildings by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stunell said changes to the country’s building regulations would make new homes, shops and offices warmer and cheaper to run, support growth and take England a step closer to meeting its bold low carbon commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s ambitious measures, developed together with the construction industry, will help reduce the regulatory cost for businesses, and pave the way for the introduction of zero-carbon homes from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals will also help with the roll out of the Green Deal this Autumn, stimulating demand, whilst helping to cut both carbon emissions and energy bills for householders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new set of Building Regulations published for consultation today will save over £63 million a year for businesses by cutting excessive red-tape and deliver safer and more sustainable buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these amendments come into force next year, more energy efficient homes will typically save householders over £150 a year on energy bills compared with homes being built in May 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeowners will also save money with an extension to the range of simple, electrical DIY jobs that can be carried out without the need for a building inspector, reducing costs for both consumers and installers and the burden on local authorities who inspect work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching the consultation, Mr Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A quarter of the carbon emissions produced each year come from our homes, so it is vital we get to grips with energy efficiency to tackle this problem. Making our homes more sustainable will also keep people warm, drive down bills and support jobs in the construction industry.
&amp;gt; “The Coalition is committed to being the greenest government ever, so improving the energy efficiency of our existing buildings through the Green Deal, and ensuring that all new homes are zero carbon by 2016 is a top priority.
&amp;gt; “But we need to do this in a way that doesn’t add to the regulatory burden on businesses. So I’m delighted that these much-needed changes will provide guidance that is both fit for purpose and will cut carbon emissions, whilst also saving money for householders and businesses alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department is now looking for views and evidence on the proposed regulations and will continue working with industry and other key partners before finalising proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The consultation opens today and responses can be provided up until 27 April 2012, other than the proposals related to the Green Deal where responses have been requested by 27 March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The Government will consider the responses and aim for new building regulations to come into force in 2013, although some changes might be brought in earlier to support the Green Deal framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The consultation document on the new proposed regulations has four sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;changes to technical details&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing the energy efficiency of buildings&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;electrical safety in homes; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

    <title>New green building hub puts Britain centre stage of transition to low-carbon future</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new national construction centre will provide thousands of young people with the building skills they need to refurbish the nation’s homes so they become greener and cheaper to run, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Stunell said the new Centre of Refurbishment Excellence, which he opened today in Stoke-on-Trent, would provide the nation’s first green building skills hub, helping to create thousands of new jobs and preparing Britain for a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the heart of the country on the site of a Victorian pottery works, the £11 million centre will provide a national focal point for the construction industry and related trades, serving as a training facility and showroom for the latest green building solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique education centre will host courses and tutorials for 300 students and 2,000 tradesmen, teaching the latest innovative techniques for the green refurbishment of homes, and preparing the country for the Green Deal that is due to launch in autumn 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Green Deal homeowners and tenants will be able sign up specialist providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient. No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the improvements over time, with the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Green Deal represents a major opportunity for business - by 2015 up to 100,000 workers could be employed in the effort to upgrade Britain’s homes, and the new centre in Stoke will play a major role in the training of students and tradesmen in the methods and materials they need to become Green Deal providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over three-quarters of the buildings that will be standing in 2050 have already been built - so it is vital that we find ways to reduce carbon emissions from all types of existing buildings, and for every type of budget, or the country risks losing its battle against climate change.
&amp;gt; “That’s why this Government has wasted no time taking practical steps to pave the way for tenants and homeowners to retrofit their homes through Green Deal, and for businesses to provide the upgrades.
&amp;gt; “But with the clock ticking towards the launch of the Green Deal, it is now essential that businesses have all the necessary skills to carry out green upgrades on existing homes.
&amp;gt; “So I’m delighted to be opening the new national centre for green building expertise - the new skills hub will become an international centre of excellence for providing the right skills to retrofit homes, helping to create jobs and putting Britain centre stage of the multi-billion pound transition to a low-carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new centre will become a catalyst for the regeneration of the Longton area of the city, and help provide much-needed training and employment to local young people and tradesmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their new skills will help them refurbish the UK housing stock to the highest modern standards - in areas such as photovoltaic solar panels, ground source heat pumps, and new insulation techniques - and help Britain compete in the global low carbon market that is projected to be worth £4 trillion a year by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government funding helped develop the new centre, which will now run as a partnership between Building Research Establishment, Stoke-on-Trent City Council and Stoke-on-Trent College. A second phase will see the redevelopment of the Grade II listed Enson Pottery Works into an additional exhibition and training facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pioneer projects that are similar to the Green Deal have already started - in the largest scheme of its kind in Manchester, the Social Homes Ecofit scheme will provide improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems for up to 9,000 social homes to make them more energy efficient, at no upfront cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrades could save tenants up to £500 per year on energy bills, and at the same time create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to businesses in Manchester carrying out the home improvements. Mr Stunell called for other social landlords to follow their lead, to improve the lives of their tenants and at the same time bring a much needed economic boost to local economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Your parks and green spaces need you</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stunell has announced that next year’s Green Flag Award application round is open, and urged groups that manage green spaces and parks, including those managed and created by local communities, to step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Communities Minister also said that the scheme, which has continued to raise the standard of quality of green spaces since its start in 1996, has Government support to continue past 31 August 2012, the end of its current arrangement. Mr Stunell indicated the Government’s intention will be to advertise next year for an external group to run the Green Flag Award scheme under license from 1 September 2012, and to invite bids. Details of the license offer will be available in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Green Flag Award scheme continues to recognise the importance of our green spaces and the efforts of those who look after them. 2010/11 was the best year yet for the number of awards and long may this continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme has just had its most successful year, with 1,290 green spaces receiving an award and raising the standard: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712"&gt;www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712&lt;/a&gt; (external link). The Green Flag Community Award category, which recognises those spaces run by voluntary and community groups, saw a 13 per cent increase in winning entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Green Flag Award is the national standard for public green space, currently used by 77 per cent of local authorities for green space management. The awards are increasingly being used by communities to maintain and improve the quality of precious green spaces such as parks, community gardens, woodlands, and allotments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further details about the Green Flag Award scheme and the application round for 2012/2013 can be found at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/Awards/GreenFlag/Default.aspx"&gt;www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/Awards/GreenFlag/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grant Shapps calls on social landlords to help their tenants reduce energy bills</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on councils and housing associations across the country to help their tenants during this time of high energy prices by taking steps that could save each tenant up to £500 a year on energy bills and create thousands of jobs in their local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the countdown to the Government’s Green Deal initiative underway, the Minister urged social landlords to make a positive difference to their tenants’ lives by using existing funding models to start their own ‘Pay As You Save’ scheme, making homes in their area warmer and more comfortable to live in, and at the same time cheaper to run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps pointed to pioneer projects, similar to the Green Deal, which have already started and could be replicated elsewhere. In the largest scheme of its kind in Manchester, the Social Homes Ecofit scheme means improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems are being made to up to 9,000 social homes to make them more energy efficient, at no upfront cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrades could save tenants up to £500 per year on energy bills, and at the same time create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to businesses in Manchester carrying out the home improvements. Mr Shapps now wants other social landlords to follow their lead, and use every opportunity to improve the lives of their tenants and at the same time bring a much needed economic boost to local economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our homes count for over a quarter of all UK emissions - it’s essential we do more to make them greener. And at time when tenants are feeling the pinch of high energy prices, it is more important than ever that social landlords use this opportunity to take the simple steps that could save their tenants hundreds of pounds through reduced bills.
&amp;gt; “Measures such as the Green Deal will make a huge difference to the lives of tenants, and help landlords in their efforts to make their homes cleaner and greener. By making the most of the opportunities that are available now social landlords can get a head start on upgrading their homes and give an immediate shot in the arm to the local economy.
&amp;gt; “In Greater Manchester a number of projects are already underway to improve thousands of homes so tenants can enjoy the benefits of warmer homes and lower energy bills. The scheme will not only reduce tenants’ energy bills but also create hundreds of jobs for local people. So I want other social landlords to learn from their example, and see what they can do to help their tenants and boost local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Green Deal, which will launch in autumn 2012, homeowners and tenants will be able sign up for Green Deal providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient. No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the improvements over time, with the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills. By allowing the improvements to be paid for gradually, the scheme will remove one of the biggest barriers for retrofitting existing homes - the cost of the initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Social landlords can use their existing powers to vary rents and service charges paid by tenants to gradually recoup a proportion of the upfront costs of the energy efficiency improvements. The increased charges will be offset by lower fuel bills so tenants will still be better off - a ‘Pay As You Save’ model similar to the Green Deal. The remainder of the costs can be met through other existing funding sources such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP), which requires energy suppliers to deliver every saving measures to customers in the most deprived parts of the country; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), which requires the “big six” energy suppliers to make savings in the amounts of carbon dioxide emitted by households, by promoting low-carbon technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

    <title>Stunell and Neville kick off revolution in tackling carbon emissions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today joined ex-footballer and sustainability campaigner Gary Neville in Sheffield to open a revolutionary ‘carbon negative’ office - a building that produces more energy than it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister joined Mr Neville, a keen environmentalist and the founder of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.sustainabilityinsport.com/home.html"&gt;Sustainability in Sport&lt;/a&gt; (external link), to open the open the Old Corn Mill, near Penistone, in West Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of solar panels, two wind turbines and a water turbine powered by the River Don means that the new offices generate surplus energy that is put back into the national grid system, effectively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and giving the building an energy performance rating of A+. The average building in England is rated D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy efficient features at the Old Corn Mill include triple glazing; substantial insulation; low-energy appliances; eco lighting, and underfloor heating using a geothermal water source beneath the car park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally a 1750’s three-story mill, the building has been carefully renovated using existing materials and the latest insulation and energy efficient materials to create a three storey office. The original structure is traditional 1750’s cut stone but a new build extension has been added highlighting the blend of old and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The built environment contributes almost half of the UK’s carbon emissions each year and if UK is to play its part tackling climate change, we need to make our buildings more sustainable.
&amp;gt; “This new carbon-negative building is a prime example of how the offices on the future can work - generating not only enough energy to power themselves, but also others - as well as being practical and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability champion Gary Neville said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s great to see offices like this being built. It just shows that businesses as well as individuals can do their bit for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bob Neill responds to claims that planning reforms will threaten historic cities</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Government Minister Bob Neill responds to an article in the Telegraph claiming that planning reforms will threaten historic towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Hipkin (“It’s not just the countryside that’s at risk, 5 October 2011) is mistaken, the planning reforms will not downgrade protections for the historic environment. They will actually make it clearer and encourage better up keep to prevent neglect or decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft maintains strong protections against urban sprawl and gives local communities the power to decide where to protect or develop through their local plan. Listing buildings and scheduling for ancient monuments will continue. Any development that might cause significant harm to an important heritage asset would not be allowed unless stringent tests were passed to justify any such an exceptional violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents, rightly, expect their council to discharge their legal duties including heritage protection and councils should set their budgets in a way that allows them do that. Despite the huge public deficit funding for councils this year was fair and progressive - the average reduction was just 4.4 per cent. Councils should look to prioritise efficiency savings or share services with neighbouring authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already in discussions with heritage groups about where they think things could be made clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our planning system reforms won’t create a planning free-for-all (as has been suggested in the Daily Mail). What they will do is put local people in charge of deciding areas they wish to see developed and those to be protected - done through Local Plans that will be sovereign, and drive planning decision-making. Our proposals state development needs to be sustainable and satisfy strong environmental safeguards that remain part of the planning system. We’re committed to the new homes and jobs we desperately need but not at the expense of the environment. We want to safeguard the natural environment and we have made this very clear in the draft planning framework, with strong protections for the Green Belt, ancient woodlands, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and many other natural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Government is maintaining strong protections to safeguard the countryside, gardens, the Green Belt and other valued green spaces, including wildlife sites, from urban sprawl.
&amp;gt; “Leaving employment land already zoned for development lying empty for decades, without any prospect of it being put to productive use, is of no benefit to communities. It makes sense to build more homes instead of having industrial and commercial wastelands. The draft framework clearly supports the use of land with the least environmental or amenity value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This suggestion is completely untrue and has no factual basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government stated its commitment to maintaining national Green Belt protection in its first weeks in the Coalition Agreement. The Green Belt has a valuable role in stopping urban sprawl and providing a green lung around towns and cities and this policy is continued in the new draft national planning policy framework.
 &lt;br&gt;
“In addition the proposed abolition of the unpopular Regional Strategies, through the Localism Bill, will remove top-down pressure on councils to review the extent of their Green Belt which was likely to effect more than thirty areas across England. Our new draft planning policy on traveller sites explicitly increases protection for the Green Belt and open countryside.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We utterly reject the accusation that the building of new homes needs to be at the expense of the environment. The draft framework uses the established definition of sustainable development set out by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, and sets out clear environmental protections to ensure that inappropriate development is not approved.
&amp;gt; “The reforms will give much greater power to local people and make sure local plans reflect the needs of their areas in a way which is sustainable. For the first time local people have the chance to have a real say in how their towns and villages are developed, by giving them the power to produce Neighbourhood Plans which will become a formal part of the planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andrew Stunell responds to suggestions that planning reforms will hit allotments</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell responds to suggestions that the National Planning Policy Framework will threaten allotments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Stunell told BBC News:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely untrue that there is any threat to allotments as a result of the planning reforms that we’re putting forward. It’s completely the opposite, in fact.
&amp;gt; “Local communities will have the ability in the future to dictate what the local plan for them should be, and to set aside those allotments, and of course existing allotments are protected under legislation at the moment.
&amp;gt; “What we’re trying to make sure happens is that we do have a planning system that can respond to what local communities do want, rather than them always chasing after applications trying to stop things afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building greener homes costing less each year</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building new homes to greener, low-carbon standards is getting cheaper every year, according to a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeupdatedcostreview"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published today by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new research, based on interviews with developers and the latest information about environmental technologies, shows the overall extra costs of building new homes to standards set in the Code for Sustainable Homes is falling year on year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For homes built to Code level 3 standards, average extra costs have fallen by almost three quarters in the last three years - falling from £4,458 in 2008 to £1,128 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building greener homes is vital if we are to meet our nation’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change - so today’s report is good news for the entire country. The progress that has been made does not only benefit developers building Code-standard homes, it also provides valuable lessons ahead of the transition to building new homes to zero carbon standards from 2016.
&amp;gt; “As a country we still have lot of work to do to reduce carbon emissions from new development, but what these figures show us is that as the construction industry continues to build more sustainable homes, there is further potential for the costs associated building greener homes to continue falling”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Code for Sustainable Homes is the national standard for the sustainable design and construction of new homes. The Code aims to reduce our carbon emissions and create homes that are more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2007, the Code is used to measure the sustainability of new homes against nine design categories, each offering a range of ‘credits’ for meeting sustainability criteria. The more ‘credits’ secured the higher the Code star rating awarded to a development, up to Code level 6.Developers can chose which technologies and approaches they wish to use to minimise their costs and maximise their credits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every year since the Code started in 2007, a short piece of research has been conducted to establish approximately how much different Code standards and components cost, and what the trends are amongst developers in securing Code credits.  This latest report will be the third in the series, and was commissioned last year as part of the impact assessment underpinning the 2010 revision of the Code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The work is based on primary research and interviews with both private and public housing developers, as well as modelling of cost trends across a wide range of environmental building technologies and services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Andrew Stunell responds to an article in the Sunday Telegraph suggesting that planning reforms put the green belt in peril</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stunell responds in full to an article in the Sunday Telegraph suggesting that the Government’s planning reforms put the Green Belt in peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion by certain groups that the Government’s planning reforms put the Green Belt in peril is misleading and simply wrong (Furious battle over Green Belt, Sunday, 7 August 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government is committed to safeguarding the natural and historic environment and has made this very clear in the draft National Planning Policy Framework which protects the Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and many other natural areas including ancient woodland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need sustainable growth to provide the jobs and homes we need but this will not be at the expense of the environment. Our streamlining of the planning system does not give the green light to development everywhere and the doomsday scenario being played out by certain groups that reform will wreck the environment does not stack up. Development will be expected to be sustainable and well-designed if it is to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are scrapping the top down Regional Strategies, which threatened to concrete over the Green Belt in more than 30 areas, and introducing a new special protection for green spaces that are most important to local communities, recognising the value of green spaces in both urban and rural areas. In addition, new guidance on traveller sites will increase protection of the Green Belt and open countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These safeguards along with the new planning powers we’re introducing for communities - the people best placed to determine what they need in their area - will not only protect, but will help enhance, the Green Belt and our natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dramatic-simplification-of-planning-guidance-to-encourage-sustainable-growth--3"/>
    <title>Dramatic simplification of planning guidance to encourage sustainable growth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new, simpler framework for the planning system that safeguards the environment while meeting the need for sustainable growth has been published for consultation today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National planning policy, which is the basis for every local plan and decision, has accumulated to over one thousand pages during the last decade. Its volume and complexity have made planning increasingly inaccessible to all but specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government in the Coalition Agreement committed to turning this thicket of national planning policy into a clear, tightly focused document, setting out national priorities and rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Ministers are inviting views on the draft &lt;em&gt;National Planning Policy Framework&lt;/em&gt; - which streamlines national policy from over 1,000 pages to just 52 pages of policy - as part of a consultation to get the planning system right for current and future generations. The draft Framework draws on responses to an initial call for evidence earlier in the year. The Government intends to consult on simplifying other guidance on national policy as the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning the draft Framework are powerful protections for communities to safeguard the natural and historic environment. It maintains the Government’s commitment to protecting the green belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest; facilitates a new generation of renewable energy projects; paves the way for green transport of the future - the electric car - by encouraging decision makers to provide charging points; re-affirms protections for our nation’s historic and cultural heritage, and for our wildlife and bio-diversity, including new protection for peat bogs; and helps tackle the light pollution affecting the beauty of the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the draft Framework delivers on the Government’s commitment in the &lt;em&gt;Natural Environment White Paper&lt;/em&gt; to allow communities to earmark important local green spaces for special protection - whether its value is in its natural beauty, its historical resonances, its recreational value, its tranquillity or its richness in wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft Framework also underlines the need for councils to work closely with communities and businesses and actively seek opportunities for sustainable growth to rebuild the economy; helping to deliver the homes, jobs, and infrastructure needed for a growing population whilst protecting the environment. A presumption in favour of sustainable development means that proposals should be approved promptly unless they would compromise the key sustainable development principles set out in the draft Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clarity in planning has become lost in translation. National planning policy and central government guidance has become so bloated that it now contains more words than the complete works of Shakespeare, making it impenetrable to ordinary people.
&amp;gt; “We need a simpler, swifter system that is easier to understand and where you don’t need to pay for a lawyer to navigate your way around. That’s why we promised reform to make planning easier to understand and easier to use for everyone.
&amp;gt; “Today’s proposals set out national planning policy more concisely, and in doing so make clearer the importance of planning to safeguarding our extraordinary environment and meeting the needs of communities, now and in the future.
&amp;gt; “We now want to hear the thoughts of councils, communities and businesses on the draft Framework and work together to get the planning system right for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our Natural Environment White Paper set out how we will not only continue to protect our countryside and green spaces, but improve them. This new planning framework will help make this a reality. It will give local communities the power to protect green spaces that mean so much to them, while still giving the highest protection to our treasured landscapes such as national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It will also ensure that development needed to grow the economy is carried out in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strong, sustainable growth is the Government’s top priority. The new proposals published today, a key element of the plan for growth, set out plans that are responsive to business whilst protecting the concerns of communities and their environment.
&amp;gt; “Along with the powerful presumption for sustainable development, the new approach to planning will be a significant step forward in creating the right conditions for businesses to start up, invest, grow and create jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft Framework requires that development is carried out in a sustainable way. Sustainable development is that which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is central to the economic, environmental and social success of the country and is the core principle underpinning planning. Simply stated, the principle, as established by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, recognises the importance of ensuring that all people should be able to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life, both now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chair of the Major Developers Group, Sir Stuart Lipton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are delighted with the results of the proposals in the Framework as concepts. We have for years suggested that the planning system, with its accumulation of layers of directives and strategies needed radical reform. We support the strategies of the Framework which we feel will provide a more effective planning system. It will have regard for a balance of the interests of the community, the environment and the growth agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chairman of National Association of Local Councils, Michael Carter said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The National Association is delighted that the overarching aim of the document is to empower communities, including very local parish and town councils, to shape the areas in which they live. We agree that they should have a major say in where housing, and other types of sustainable development, should go. The National Association believes that this is vital for sustainable economic growth in England. We welcome the fact that local communities will have the power to set their own standards that will meet the needs of local circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head of external affairs at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Stephen Thornton, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors welcomes the Government’s draft National Planning Policy Framework as a significant step forward in unlocking the planning system to deliver the growth required by UK Plc. We are pleased to see this concise outline of national planning policy at a strategic level rather than the thousands of pages of guidance that currently lose the thrust of what the Government is trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive of the Institute of Archaeologists, Peter Hinton said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Framework sets out clearly Government’s twin objectives of conserving the historic environment in a sustainable manner and of ensuring wide public benefit from expert investigations of those elements affected by development. We look forward to continuing to work with government in the coming weeks to make sure that the key heritage messages of the framework can be fully understood and implemented by heritage and property professionals, by local government, and by the communities they all serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director of Policy and Strategy of London First, John Dickie said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;London First welcomes the publication of the draft National Planning Policy Framework which we believe will encourage growth and investment by consolidating planning guidance into a clear and concise document. Ending pages and pages of overlapping guidance and circulars has to be right. The draft Framework published today also signals the Government’s continued commitment to liberalise the planning system which we strongly support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief executive of the British Property Federation Liz Peace, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Planning policy should be streamlined, succinct and to the point if it is to deliver the growth and sustainable development that this country needs.
&amp;gt; “We understand that the new draft Framework follows closely the version submitted by the Practitioners Advisory Group which fully incorporated these principles. On that basis we will have no problem in giving today’s Framework our ringing endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Member of the Practitioners Advisory Group John Rhodes said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most people involved in the planning industry recognise that it has become too complex and bureaucratic - and that it has lost sight of its principal purpose, which should be to deliver the homes, jobs and great places the country needs in an environmentally responsible way. The draft framework takes the opportunity to do something about that by making a real contribution to economic recovery and environmental objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government wants the fullest possible scrutiny of the draft framework. A full 12 week consultation starts today. Details can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/draftframeworkconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/draftframeworkconsultation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ministers will ensure that both Houses of Parliament are given the opportunity to scrutinise the draft Framework. They have invited the Communities and Local Government Select Committee to comment on the draft Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consultation workshops have been arranged across the country to hear directly from people with an interest. These will be in London on Wednesday, 7 September; Leeds on Thursday, September 8; Birmingham on Tuesday, September 13; Bristol on Thursday, September 15; London on Wednesday, September 28; and Manchester on Tuesday, October 4. Full details can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short summary of the main proposals in the draft Framework can be found at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/draftframeworksummary"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/draftframeworksummary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The abolition of regional strategies and reforms of the planning system are central to boosting homes and jobs. Without burdensome regional planning policy councils will be free to prepare their Local Plans without having to follow top-down targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further comments on the publication of the draft Framework include:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Paul Everitt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We welcome today’s consultation on the National Planning Policy Framework, which looks to encourage the installation of charging infrastructure for ultra-low carbon vehicles in new developments. We hope that, through their planning powers, local authorities use this opportunity to deliver a comprehensive charging network, working with industry, to advance low and ultra-low carbon motoring in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andrew Stunell visits low-carbon Coronation Street of the future</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell has seen how Government plans to make existing homes warmer and cheaper to run could work on the Coronation Streets of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the countdown to the Government’s Green Deal initiative underway, the Minister visited the University of Salford’s pioneering Energy House. The life-sized Coronation Street-style terraced property has been built within a sealed chamber for testing ways to reduce domestic energy consumption, and can show how existing homes can be made more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Green Deal is a new and radical way of making energy efficiency available to all. Under the scheme, homeowners and tenants will be able sign up for Green Deal providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the green home improvements over time, with all the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills. By allowing the improvements to be paid for gradually, the scheme will remove one of the biggest barriers for retrofitting existing homes - the cost of the initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit to Energy House comes as the Government published the biennial report on progress to make the nation’s buildings more sustainable. A new design for the front page of Energy Performance Certificates has also been revealed. The changes will make the certificate more relevant and engaging to householders, and help them understand what action can be taken to make their homes warmer and save money on energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over 40 per cent of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the built environment, so we must make every effort to ensure retrofit schemes like the Green Deal work, or the country risks losing its battle against climate change. That’s why I’ve come to the Energy House today. This fantastic facility shows us that greening our homes isn’t just an elite pastime, it’s something everyone can do.
&amp;gt; “With the countdown to the Green Deal underway, the Energy House will be a vital tool for understanding how measures to improve energy efficiency measures work in practice. I have argued for many years that we must close the gap between the predicted improvements of retrofitting and actual energy performance, so I’m delighted the Energy House will help us achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister also witnessed the work being carried out by the University of Salford’s Energy Hub, to encourage tenants to take up the Green Deal. Mr Stunell said improving tenant engagement will be vital to the success of the Green Deal. The Energy Hub’s work will help social landlords understand how to get tenants on board, and the best way for social landlords to promote the retrofit scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater Manchester is already leading the way in this area, with social housing trailblazer projects in the city helping to get the market going and demonstrating the vast potential for the Green Deal in the social sector.&lt;/p&gt;
