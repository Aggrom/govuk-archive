    <title>Changes to the building regulations</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Written Ministerial Statement by The Right Honourable Don Foster MP on changes to the building regulations regime in England.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am setting out today the changes that will be made to the building regulations regime in England to deliver an even better and more cost-effective way of ensuring our buildings remain safe and sustainable. The changes will deliver savings of around £50 million per year to business. In addition, legislation will also be laid before Parliament shortly to amend the Energy Performance of Buildings Regulations and to repeal unnecessary fire provisions of Local Acts which overlap national provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-regulations-access-statements-security-changing-places-toilets-and-regulation-7"&gt;consultation paper&lt;/a&gt; issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 31 January this year contained a range of proposals to improve the building regulations regime. I am setting out today decisions on the deregulatory changes. I am also publishing today a document providing a factual summary of the responses received. The changes have been developed after active engagement with external partners and demonstrate the government’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that where regulation is necessary the impact on business is properly considered and the associated cost minimised. Decisions on the outstanding issues relating to the energy efficiency of buildings, on better targeting of radon protection measures and the referencing of British Standards for structural design based on Eurocodes will be set out in a further statement next year. We will also set out next year the outcome of the review of the framework of building regulations and local housing standards which I announced in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement with our external partners shows that they continue to value the national minimum standards provided by the building regulations. However, where any concerns do arise it is necessary to address them. That is why we listened to those that expressed concern with the costs associated with the electrical safety in the home provisions in Part P of the building regulations. Some have even advocated that Part P should be revoked as a burdensome requirement on competent electricians. We disagree - Part P has been a success - but we do recognise that there is scope to streamline the requirements by removing the requirement to notify smaller-scale, lower-risk electrical work to a building control body. Currently homeowners can face building control fees of upwards of £240 to have simple electrical work, such as an additional plug socket in a kitchen, approved by a local authority. This change will see the notification requirements focused on higher-risk jobs like the installation of new circuits, or work in the vicinity of showers and baths, which is the right approach. There will, of course, remain a duty for these non-notifiable works to comply with the safety provisions required by the regulations and which we have also updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Part P seeks to achieve a reasonable balance of risk. We will continue to monitor indicators which can help identify the impact of the changes and keep this under review. But the key to ensuring electrical work is done properly is to employ competent electricians and so the department will continue to work closely with external partners to identify what more can be done to promote the importance of complying with the provisions of Part P through use of a suitably-qualified electrician. In addition, I will be bringing forward further regulations later next year that will introduce an alternative route to demonstrating compliance with Part P by allowing for third-party certification of electrical work. This will safeguard standards whilst providing a far cheaper way of verifying work is adequate - particularly for those carrying out DIY work. These changes will be accompanied by simpler, clearer and shorter guidance in a new Approved Document P that we will be publishing shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we will be making a number of other changes to the building regulations. We will amend the technical guidance in Approved Document B (Fire safety). In particular, we will update guidance in respect of lighting diffusers which has grown out-of-date as lighting technology has changed considerably. We will also, in relation to wall coverings, be taking forward changes to mitigate problems associated with how the European reaction to fire classifications work in practice. In effect, the changes will maintain the status quo, for example, allowing wallpapers that are currently used to continue to be so in the future. Both these changes have been supported by independent research which shows there are no adverse impacts on safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be taking forward rationalisation of guidance supporting Parts M, K and N (Access, Protection from falling, collision and impact and Glazing respectively) to address areas of conflict and overlap, which again impose unnecessary costs. At the same time we will clarify the guidance on Access Statements in Approved Document M to promote a more proportionate, risk-based approach. These changes will be delivered by clearer guidance in a new Approved Document K and amendment of other Approved Documents which I will be publishing shortly. We intend that all of these deregulatory changes will come into force on 6 April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the changes to the ‘technical’ provisions, we have also agreed a number of improvements to the building control system. These are relatively minor changes to benefit both local authorities and Approved Inspectors through changes to the procedures around completion certificates, statutory notifications and removal of the ‘Warranty Link Rule’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes to regulations also extend the scope for existing competent person scheme operators. This will allow more work to be self-certified and thereby avoid the need to notify a building control body or pay a building control charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to the building regulations, we will also be publishing shortly a new Approved Document 7 which provides updated guidance on adequate materials and workmanship for building work, in particular the implications of the full implementation of the European Construction Products Regulation on 1 July 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated Energy Performance of Buildings Regulations will also be laid before the House shortly. These, in addition to consolidating the existing regulations, transpose the requirements of the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2010 and remove unnecessary ‘gold-plating’. The Directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013. The key measures include a requirement for property advertisements to include details of the Energy Performance Certificate rating where available; removal of the requirement to attach the front page of the certificate to any written material; exempting listed buildings from the need to have a certificate on their sale or rent; extending the current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500m² and; introducing a requirement for a certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500m² that are frequently visited by the public and where one has been previously issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, given this statement relates to the regulation of buildings, I am informing the House that I will also shortly be laying regulations to repeal unnecessary fire provisions in 23 Local Acts. The decision has been taken in the light of previous consultation which found no evidence to justify maintaining requirements which go beyond the necessary protection already afforded nationally through the building regulations, and lead to differing and inconsistent rules even within fire and rescue authority areas. Evidence does not establish any statistically significant impact on life safety. These changes are intended to come into force on 9 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be placing the revised guidance in the Approved Documents referred to above, along with the impact assessments that accompany all of these changes, in the Library of the House when they are published shortly and alongside the summary of responses that I am placing there today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Town and Country Planning Association conference speech</title>
    <category>Speech</category>
    <summary>This is a speech delivered by Planning Minister Nick Boles about beautiful urban landscapes and affordable homes.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;England is famous for the beauty of its landscapes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Yorkshire Dales to the South Hams, from the Weald of Kent to the Cumbrian Lakes, England glories in countryside of which generations of man and nature are joint authors.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes - together with the greater drama of their Celtic cousins - that draw visitors to these islands.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these landscapes that our most popular institution and your sister organisation, the National Trust, was set up to preserve in perpetuity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of England is its finest asset and, for each of us, our most precious inheritance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conservative in both name and spirit, as a West Country boy and a Lincolnshire MP, as the son of a former director general of the National Trust and the brother of 1 of its conservation managers, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that nothing would do more to improve the health and happiness of the British people than if more of them got to spend more of their lives surrounded by beauty.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beauty lifts, calms, excites, inspires.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more intoxicating than any narcotic, more soothing than any therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Britain becomes more prosperous, we must insist that it becomes more beautiful as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the beauty we seek, and the landscapes we treasure, are not only to be found in our open spaces.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the loveliest scenery in Britain is to be found in our villages, cities and towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take you on a journey, which starts in my constituency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, the river Welland has snaked its way through the low contours of Lincolnshire from its source in Northamptonshire’s Hothorpe Hills.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It enters Lincolnshire at the point where 4 counties meet and passes through countryside that is pleasant but hardly memorable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wandering painter or poet would not give this stretch of the Welland valley a second look, were it not for the landscape of Lincolnshire limestone that is the town of Stamford.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is not just 1 of England’s most beautiful towns; it is 1 of its finest bits of scenery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man-made. Built from stone and timber frames and slate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the aesthetic equal of our most splendid hills, lakes and rivers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where did this landscape come from?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it spring fully formed from the mind of some 17th century master planner, the brainchild of a Lincolnshire Haussman?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford is, as the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments pronounced, ‘a town of discrete buildings’, each 1 unique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earls of Exeter from nearby Burghley House provided long leases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the local community of wool, leather, cloth and hemp merchants, apothecaries and solicitors indulged themselves with a great variety of stone window surrounds, doorways, eaves, corner and chimney details.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did so within a broad set of rules set out in the London manuals of Rome educated James Gibbs but almost always used local architects and builders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamford was the spontaneous product of human initiative, haphazardly executed and totally unplanned, motivated by the desire for profit, the love of God and that age-old urge that keeps makeover shows in business, the desire to make your house nicer than your neighbours’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop is north of the border, in Great Britain’s first New Town.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, by contrast, was an example of municipal town planning at its boldest and most inspired.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the economic stagnation into which Edinburgh had slipped after the Act of Union, in 1752 the Provost, George Drummond, launched an architectural competition to design a new cityscape of wide streets, crescents and squares, featuring symmetrical terraces of town-houses as well as purpose-built shops and public gardens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six year old James Craig won the competition and, in 4 stages between the 1760s and the 1850s, he, Robert Adam, William Chambers and William Playfair all stayed loyal to the original vision and developed their own variations on a Greek revival theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In building their New Town, Edinburgh’s town councillors not only restored commercial and cultural vigour to Scotland’s capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also created 1 of the most beautiful landscapes in the British Isles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can resist the melancholy charm of a walk in the rain around Charlotte Square and through Ainslie Place? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would wager that the Facebook pages of recent visitors to Scotland contain at least as many photographs of Bute House and Moray Place as they do of Loch Lomond or Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Stamford in the early 1600s, and in Edinburgh 150 later, beauty came about as a result of the natural human urge to get together with one’s neighbours to build a place in which it would be a pleasure to live and work, to raise a family and do business.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the same generous set of instincts that, another hundred and fifty years later, inspired Ebenezer Howard to build Letchworth Garden City. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I am skating on very thin ice telling members of the Town and Country Planning Association anything about the Garden City movement, when your association was founded to promote just that.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do want take a moment, as a layman, lacking all planning qualifications, to say why, like the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, I believe that we have so much to learn from Ebenezer Howard and his garden cities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genius of Letchworth, like so many of the most appealing towns and cities, lies as much in the spaces between the buildings as in the buildings themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By resisting the temptation to cram as many houses as possible onto the available land and adopting their golden rule of twelve houses to the acre, Letchworth’s architects, Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin allowed room for the organic intermingling of nature and architecture.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buildings are buttressed by front and back gardens, the roads are lined with broad verges and trees, the town is criss-crossed with footpaths and patchworked with allotments and parks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ebenezer Howard himself put it, “Parks and gardens, orchards and woods, are being planted in the midst of the busy life of the people, so that they can be enjoyed in the fullest measure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letchworth and the other garden cities work as living, breathing urban communities because, as an Ebenezer Howard put it, they combine “the advantages of the most energetic and active town life, with all the beauty and delight of the country.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the way most English people want to live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to build places like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has been holding us back?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only been planning minister for a few months but I have observed the debate about housing and planning for over ten years and I think I know what is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are trapped in a vicious circle.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People look at the new housing estates that have been bolted on to their towns and villages in recent decades and observe that few of them are beautiful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, many of them are pig-ugly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Harrisons Wharf in Purfleet that I visited last week.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure the flats inside are nice enough but they occupy an overbearing and unbroken slab of dismal brickwork that is an insult to the community it borders, cutting it off from a stretch of the River Thames which, in Victorian times, attracted day-trippers from London keen to take a pleasant walk along banks of the river.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since new housing estates are all too often soulless and formulaic, and those who will inhabit them will add to the pressure on local roads, primary school places and doctor’s appointments, existing residents oppose any proposal to build new houses on green field sites, even when the land is of low environmental quality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities respond to the wishes of local voters by putting too few sites into their local plans. And this drives the cost of development land up to stratospheric levels (roughly £3 million an hectare in the South East and East of England by 2010.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers respond by stuffing as many units as they can onto any site and, in an attempt to make the properties affordable, skimp on room size, architectural features, vernacular materials, communal spaces and landscape design.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, because we don’t build beautifully, people don’t let us build much. And because we don’t build much, we can’t afford to build beautifully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the coalition, and my personal mission as planning minister, is to help us break out of this vicious circle once and for all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to get back on to that confident, progressive path, which created Stamford, Edinburgh New Town and Letchworth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to build beautiful and affordable places once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have we done to bring this about? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Pickles’ first step, in June 2010, was to scrap John Prescott’s blanket density target of 30 dwellings per hectare and to stop the garden grabbing that was destroying the precious green spaces that make Britain’s cities so pleasant to live in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government then embarked on a root and branch reform of the planning system and the creation of the National Planning Policy Framework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a mammoth task which had to be masterminded by a minister with a mammoth brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my predecessor, Greg Clark, is blessed with exactly that - as well as the unfailing patience and politeness required to bring the good ship Reform to dock with most of those interested in planning and development still on board.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Planning Framework establishes a few clear principles, which it is now my job to drive through.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That local councils should take charge of development in their areas by drawing up local plans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that alongside the power to plan comes the responsibility to provide new houses to meet people’s aspirations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through their local plans, councils must bring forward enough land to meet the objectively assessed housing needs of their area over the next 5 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they do so, they will be able to protect precious open spaces against speculative development.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Secretary of State and I will back them to the hilt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if they fail to take their responsibilities seriously, the presumption in favour of sustainable development will fill the vacuum and make the vital decisions that they are ducking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the Framework, Grant Shapps introduced the New Homes Bonus, which gives local councils additional money for every new home for which they give planning permission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in what I believe will turn out to be our most revolutionary step, the government launched neighbourhood planning through which villages, parishes and other neighbourhoods can take control of their future and decide for themselves how and where development should take place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be talking more about our ambitions for neighbourhood plans after the Autumn Statement.
So the government has acted to ensure that more land is brought forward for development and that local communities have an incentive to welcome new housing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now for planners, architects and developers, large and small, to seize the opportunity we have created and start designing beautiful places, which local people will welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, on the edge of Bishops Castle in Shropshire, Bob Tomlinson and Carole Salmon set out to create a new, contemporary village, a friendly place that people would want to live.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was The Wintles, 1 of the most exciting and enchanting collection of new houses anywhere in England.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The houses are all different.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are unashamedly contemporary but incorporate vernacular features in a bold and imaginative way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use a wide range of both natural and manufactured materials and make a priority of the spaces between the buildings (both private and communal) and the planting of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wintles did not get everything right first time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which experiment ever does?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not as integrated into the rest of Bishops Castle as some long-standing residents would like. And, to replicate it on a large scale, one would need to find a way to build houses that are just as beautiful and just as sustainable but cost less to build.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Bishops Castle I believe that the Living Village Trust created a model for our future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of which Ebenezer Howard would be proud.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which, once again, we build beautiful new urban landscapes full of affordable houses surrounded by green spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be our goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Abolition of regional strategies</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary>Statement by Baroness Hanham on the abolition of regional strategies</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the Government’s policy to revoke existing regional strategies outside London, reflecting manifesto commitments made by both Coalition parties in the 2010 general election and subsequently incorporated into the Coalition Agreement. The Localism Act 2011 provides for the abolition of regional strategies in a two-stage process. The first stage, to remove the regional planning framework and prevent further strategies from being created, took effect when the Localism Act received Royal Assent on 15 November. The second stage would be to abolish the existing regional strategies by secondary legislation. However, any final decision on this must take account of assessments of, and consultation on, the possible environmental effects of revocation of each of the existing regional strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Environmental Assessment process is set out in an EU Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC). In March 2012, the European Court of Justice issued a significant ruling on the interpretation and application of the Directive (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles ASBL &amp;amp; Others v Government of the Brussels-Capital Region).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process, and before the decision of the European Court of Justice, there has already been consultation with the statutory consultation bodies on the scope and level of detail of the environmental reports. Public consultation took place between October 2011 and January 2012 on the basis of environmental reports published in October 2011. Detailed responses were provided in the course of this exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, in the light of planning policy and legislation that have been put in place since January 2012, in light of the earlier consultation responses, and in order to be meticulous in observing the requirements of the Directive, the Government is now updating the environmental reports and undertaking additional consultation. We are publishing the first of the updated environmental reports: the report in respect of the proposed &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/strategic-environmental-assessments"&gt;revocation of the East of England Regional Strategy&lt;/a&gt; shortly and will place a copy in the Libraries of both Houses. This report builds on and is intended to supersede the previous report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period for consultation responses will remain open for eight weeks. We welcome and encourage all interested parties to respond. At the end of that period we will consider all consultation responses, including those already submitted during the October 2011 to January 2012 response period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks my Department will publish updated environmental reports relating to the proposals on each of the other regional strategies, so that those proposals too can be the subject of additional consultation. In each case there will be an 8 week period for consultation responses. All updated environmental reports will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as they are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed revocation of the Regional Strategies may be regarded as a material consideration by decision makers when determining planning applications and appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In respect of plan-making, the National Planning Policy Framework implementation period provides councils with the incentive to get their plan policies up to date and in doing so they can have regard to the policy to revoke Regional Strategies and the new National Planning Policy Framework policies. A local plan document must be in general conformity with the regional strategy at the stage that the plan is submitted for examination but it is open to councils when preparing local plans to take account of the policy to revoke up to the time of submission. Local authorities can also bring forward proposals (for example on housing targets) which have a local interpretation to them in their plans, based on their own sound evidence base where that is justified by the local circumstances. That evidence base is likely to be more up to date than that included in the Regional Strategies. Each case will depend on its particular facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Next steps to improve the planning system and support sustainable development</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further moves to simplify the planning system and make it more accessible to people in communities were set out today by Planning Minister Greg Clark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package of measures includes proposals to make it easier to re-use some existing buildings without needing planning permission including the so-called ‘meanwhile’ use of vacant commercial buildings; streamlining the amount of paperwork needed for a planning application; speeding up planning appeal decisions; reducing the volume of planning guidance; and ensuring planning departments are properly resourced to assess applications promptly and efficiently, reducing the burden on council taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has already taken steps to improve the planning system through the National Planning Policy Framework and the Localism Act, which are already delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the rate at which councils are putting in place a local plan is increasing in comparison to the average over the previous seven years and over 100 local authorities are now working with front-runner communities on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s proposals will help to maintain the rapid pace of reform by removing unnecessary barriers, streamlining paperwork, and supporting swifter decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Clark said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our reforms to the planning system are making it simpler, clearer and more accessible to people in communities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Following the simplification of the national planning policy in the National Planning Policy Framework, these proposed changes streamline the process of applying for planning permission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our aim is to have a system that applicants and members of communities can be confident will give a reliable, swift and fair outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making it easier to re-use existing agricultural, retail and commercial buildings, such as offices and warehouses, without the need to submit a planning application, supporting small business growth. A consultation is being published on changes to the Use Classes Order, which determines the flexibility with which such buildings can be re-used. The consultation also proposes allowing so called ‘meanwhile’ or temporary uses of certain buildings to open up premises to new businesses and to bring redundant buildings back into use, in line with recommendations in the Portas Review.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting out unnecessary information in the application process to make the system clearer, and easier to use, without undermining the ability for councils to make well-informed decisions. A consultation setting out proposals is being published today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following the approach of the National Planning Policy Framework in distilling 1,000 pages of policy into around 50, the next challenge is to review around 6,000 pages of supporting planning guidance. Details of the approach to be taken will be announced shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speeding up the process for determining planning appeals - proposals on shortening and streamlining the process will be published for consultation later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uprating local councils’ planning fees in line with inflation thereby reducing the burden on ordinary council taxpayers, who otherwise end up subsidising developers. Planning fees are set by Government and have not been increased since 2008.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring councils whose planning decisions are consistent with an up to date local plan are not ordinarily liable for costs if their decision is appealed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making technical changes to the operation of the Community Infrastructure Levy including ensuring that developers are not charged the levy twice, on the same development, if they amend existing planning consent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extending the funding to April 2013 to the four organisations providing advice and support to communities leading the way on neighbourhood planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper on allowing greater permitted development rights in changing between Use Classes is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/reusebuildingsconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A consultation paper setting out a range of proposals to streamline the information requirements for planning applications is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/streamlininginfoconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Community Infrastructure Levy allows local authorities in England and Wales to raise funds from owners or developers of land undertaking new building projects in their area. The money can be used to fund a wide range of infrastructure that is needed as a result of development, including new or safer road schemes, flood defences, park improvements, green spaces and leisure centres. The Government will introduce regulatory changes in the Autumn to improve the operation of the levy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Government is proposing to improve the performance of statutory consultees in the planning process by ensuring that there is an effective mechanism for applicants to obtain an award of costs where a statutory consultee has acted unreasonably. A consultation with detailed proposals is available at: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/statutoryconsulteeconsultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The four organisations providing support on neighbourhood planning are: the Royal Town Planning Institute; the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community; the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England working with the National Association of Local Councils and Locality (the Building Communities Consortium). The further funding will be available until the end of the financial year to enable the four support providers to offer practical and bespoke advice and assistance to those communities leading the way with their neighbourhood plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New look energy advice will help homeowners save money on bills</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;New-look Energy Performance Certificate to offer practical advice for improvements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospective homeowners will be given better and clearer advice on making their new homes more eco-friendly, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister unveiled a package of measures to make energy information on properties easier to understand, which if followed could help customers save money on their fuel bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new-look Energy Performance Certificate will give homebuyers clearer information about the energy efficiency of their homes. Alongside the recommendations for improvements, the new certificates will indicate to the consumer whether they can be funded through the Green Deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Domestic Energy Assessors, who compile the Energy Performance Certificates, will have undergone further training to ensure these documents are produced to a consistently high standard and assured advice is given to prospective homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospective buyers and tenants will also be given this energy information much earlier in the buying process, to give them time to plan how they will implement some of the recommendations included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From April, these buyers will also be able to compare the energy performance of their home with that of similar properties, as the National Energy Performance Certificate Register is opened up to public use for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to ensure the data is as secure as possible, companies wanting to use the Register will be required to sign a licensing agreement - which will include strict rules over how the data is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Energy Performance Certificate has proved useful in putting the efficiency of our homes at the forefront of our minds, but homeowners can often struggle to know how to act on the advice it gives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re giving it a complete redesign, making it clearer and easier to understand and putting the recommendations for improvements into matters of pounds and pence by showing how much consumers could potentially save on their energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And by making the national register of Energy Performance Certificates open to the public, each homeowner will for the first time be able to see how their property compares with others, and where changes could be made so their homes become as eco-friendly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>National Planning Policy Framework</title>
    <category>Statement to parliament</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker I would like to make a statement about planning policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted today to be publishing the National Planning Policy Framework and our response to the Communities and Local Government Select Committee Report of the 21 December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our reforms to planning policy have 3 fundamental objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To put unprecedented power in the hands of communities to shape the places in which they live;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To better support growth to give the next generation the chance that our generation has had to have a decent home, and to allow the jobs to be created on which our prosperity depends; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To ensure that the places we cherish - our countryside, towns and cities - are bequeathed to the next generation in a better condition than they are now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve these objectives reform is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade of Regional Spatial Strategies, top-down targets and national planning policy guidance that has swelled beyond reason to over 1000 pages across 44 documents, has led to communities seeing planning as something done to them, rather than &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as the planning system has become more complex, it has ground ever slower. In 2004 Parliament required every council to have a plan - eight years on, only around a half have been able to adopt one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last decade - starting long before the financial crisis - we built fewer homes than in any peacetime decade for 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average age of the first-time buyer is approaching 40, and rising rents mean that families have to spend more and more on housing, and less and less on themselves and their children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t allow this to go on. To do so would be to deny our responsibility to young families - to tell them that the property-owning democracy was for our generation but not for yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of this is down to sclerosis in the planning system, but some is. The Chambers of Commerce have said that the planning system has become;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;too complicated, too costly, too uncertain. It discourages investment, creates mistrust and holds back our recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not as if what has made it through has made up in quality what it lacks in quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much development in recent years has been mediocre, insensitive and has detracted from the character of the areas in which we live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many of our habitats have been degraded and nature driven out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect has been that much of the public have come to assume that any particular change to our built environment will be negative - that it will tend to impair beauty, damage the environment and make our lives worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a disastrous state of affairs in a country which is home to some of the most talented designers, and the best architects and craftsmen in the world, and which has over the years constructed villages and cities and buildings - like the one we meet in - that people cross the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our reforms to the planning system take on each of these challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They enshrine the local plan - produced by local people - as the keystone of the planning system;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They make planning much simpler and more accessible, reducing over a thousand pages of often impenetrable jargon into around 50 pages of clearly written guidance;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They establish a presumption in favour of sustainable development that means that development is not held up unless to approve it would be against our collective interest;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Framework guarantees robust protections for our natural and historic environment, and goes further by requiring net improvements to put right some of the neglect that has been visited on us;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It raises the bar on design standards so that we have the most exacting requirement for design that the English planning system has ever contained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, I have always regarded reforming the planning system as a serious responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start I made it clear that Parliament should be central to the development of the policy, we have had three full debates in this House and in the House of Lords - and I asked the Communities and Local Government Select Committee to consider the draft National Planning Policy Framework and to give me its considered advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put on record my thanks to the chairman and members of that Committee and to Environmental Audit Committee for the seriousness and thoughtfulness that they brought to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to tell colleagues that of the Committee’s 35 recommendations, I have been able to accept 30 in whole or in part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular the final framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes it clear that the local plan is, as the Committee put it, the keystone of the planning edifice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is crystal clear that sustainable development embraces social and environmental as well as economic objectives and does so in a balanced way;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refers explicitly to the five principles of the UK Sustainable Development Strategy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goes further than ever before and is clear that councils should look for net improvements on all dimensions of sustainability;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes explicit that the presumption in favour of sustainable development works through, not against, local plans;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes it clear that relevant policies - such as those protecting the Green Belt, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, National Parks and other areas - cannot be overridden by the presumption;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognises the intrinsic value and beauty of the countryside (whether specifically designated or not);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes explicit what was always implicit: that councils’ policies must encourage brownfield sites to be brought back into use;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Underlines the importance of town centres, while recognising that businesses in rural communities should be free to expand;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Takes a localist approach to creating a buffer of housing supply over and above 5 years, and in the use of windfall sites;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows councils to protect back gardens - those precious urban oases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensures that playing fields continue to benefit from that same protection that they do currently;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final framework has been strengthened by the contributions of everyone who has taken the trouble to submit their views and I am very grateful for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always been my intention that councils who have done the right thing and either adopted, or have made good progress towards adopting local plans, will not be disadvantaged by the change to new policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, I have introduced transitional arrangements suggested by, and agreed with, the Local Government Association. They accord weight to plans according to how advanced they are. However, I have gone further in two respects. I have allowed 12 months from today for existing plans to be adjusted to be in complete conformity with the new framework, and made clear that weight can be given to emerging plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Mr Speaker, this House has a particular role to play in safeguarding the interests of our successors. Having shaped the development of the new framework, I will ensure that Parliament supervises the implementation of the policies starting with a debate on the floor of the House soon after we return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, the purpose of planning is to help make the way we live our lives tomorrow better than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This National Planning Policy Framework will help build the homes the next generation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports growth to allow employers to create the jobs our constituents need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It protects what we hold dear in our matchless countryside and in the fabric of our history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does so by taking power away from remote bodies and putting it firmly into the hands of the people of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I warmly commend it to the House.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government takes next step on zero carbon homes</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zero-Carbon Homes are a step closer today after new proposals were announced to cut carbon emissions in new and existing buildings by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Stunell said changes to the country’s building regulations would make new homes, shops and offices warmer and cheaper to run, support growth and take England a step closer to meeting its bold low carbon commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s ambitious measures, developed together with the construction industry, will help reduce the regulatory cost for businesses, and pave the way for the introduction of zero-carbon homes from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposals will also help with the roll out of the Green Deal this Autumn, stimulating demand, whilst helping to cut both carbon emissions and energy bills for householders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new set of Building Regulations published for consultation today will save over £63 million a year for businesses by cutting excessive red-tape and deliver safer and more sustainable buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these amendments come into force next year, more energy efficient homes will typically save householders over £150 a year on energy bills compared with homes being built in May 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeowners will also save money with an extension to the range of simple, electrical DIY jobs that can be carried out without the need for a building inspector, reducing costs for both consumers and installers and the burden on local authorities who inspect work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching the consultation, Mr Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A quarter of the carbon emissions produced each year come from our homes, so it is vital we get to grips with energy efficiency to tackle this problem. Making our homes more sustainable will also keep people warm, drive down bills and support jobs in the construction industry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Coalition is committed to being the greenest government ever, so improving the energy efficiency of our existing buildings through the Green Deal, and ensuring that all new homes are zero carbon by 2016 is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But we need to do this in a way that doesn’t add to the regulatory burden on businesses. So I’m delighted that these much-needed changes will provide guidance that is both fit for purpose and will cut carbon emissions, whilst also saving money for householders and businesses alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department is now looking for views and evidence on the proposed regulations and will continue working with industry and other key partners before finalising proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The consultation opens today and responses can be provided up until 27 April 2012, other than the proposals related to the Green Deal where responses have been requested by 27 March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) The Government will consider the responses and aim for new building regulations to come into force in 2013, although some changes might be brought in earlier to support the Green Deal framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) The consultation document on the new proposed regulations has four sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;changes to technical details&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing the energy efficiency of buildings&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;electrical safety in homes; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;changes to the building control system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) The proposed 2013 changes take the next step towards the 2016 zero carbon standard for homes by tightening the carbon dioxide targets for new buildings and introducing specific energy efficiency targets for new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) The energy bill savings under this Government include those from 2010 Building Regulations changes as well as those proposed in this consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) An ‘Easier to Read’ summary of the 2012 consultation on changes to building regulations can be found here: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/2077415.pdf"&gt;www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/2077415.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 212kb).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New green building hub puts Britain centre stage of transition to low-carbon future</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new national construction centre will provide thousands of young people with the building skills they need to refurbish the nation’s homes so they become greener and cheaper to run, Communities Minister Andrew Stunell announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Stunell said the new Centre of Refurbishment Excellence, which he opened today in Stoke-on-Trent, would provide the nation’s first green building skills hub, helping to create thousands of new jobs and preparing Britain for a low carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the heart of the country on the site of a Victorian pottery works, the £11 million centre will provide a national focal point for the construction industry and related trades, serving as a training facility and showroom for the latest green building solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique education centre will host courses and tutorials for 300 students and 2,000 tradesmen, teaching the latest innovative techniques for the green refurbishment of homes, and preparing the country for the Green Deal that is due to launch in autumn 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Green Deal homeowners and tenants will be able sign up specialist providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient. No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the improvements over time, with the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Green Deal represents a major opportunity for business - by 2015 up to 100,000 workers could be employed in the effort to upgrade Britain’s homes, and the new centre in Stoke will play a major role in the training of students and tradesmen in the methods and materials they need to become Green Deal providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over three-quarters of the buildings that will be standing in 2050 have already been built - so it is vital that we find ways to reduce carbon emissions from all types of existing buildings, and for every type of budget, or the country risks losing its battle against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That’s why this Government has wasted no time taking practical steps to pave the way for tenants and homeowners to retrofit their homes through Green Deal, and for businesses to provide the upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But with the clock ticking towards the launch of the Green Deal, it is now essential that businesses have all the necessary skills to carry out green upgrades on existing homes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So I’m delighted to be opening the new national centre for green building expertise - the new skills hub will become an international centre of excellence for providing the right skills to retrofit homes, helping to create jobs and putting Britain centre stage of the multi-billion pound transition to a low-carbon future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new centre will become a catalyst for the regeneration of the Longton area of the city, and help provide much-needed training and employment to local young people and tradesmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their new skills will help them refurbish the UK housing stock to the highest modern standards - in areas such as photovoltaic solar panels, ground source heat pumps, and new insulation techniques - and help Britain compete in the global low carbon market that is projected to be worth £4 trillion a year by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government funding helped develop the new centre, which will now run as a partnership between Building Research Establishment, Stoke-on-Trent City Council and Stoke-on-Trent College. A second phase will see the redevelopment of the Grade II listed Enson Pottery Works into an additional exhibition and training facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pioneer projects that are similar to the Green Deal have already started - in the largest scheme of its kind in Manchester, the Social Homes Ecofit scheme will provide improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems for up to 9,000 social homes to make them more energy efficient, at no upfront cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrades could save tenants up to £500 per year on energy bills, and at the same time create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to businesses in Manchester carrying out the home improvements. Mr Stunell called for other social landlords to follow their lead, to improve the lives of their tenants and at the same time bring a much needed economic boost to local economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stunell has announced that next year’s Green Flag Award application round is open, and urged groups that manage green spaces and parks, including those managed and created by local communities, to step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Communities Minister also said that the scheme, which has continued to raise the standard of quality of green spaces since its start in 1996, has Government support to continue past 31 August 2012, the end of its current arrangement. Mr Stunell indicated the Government’s intention will be to advertise next year for an external group to run the Green Flag Award scheme under license from 1 September 2012, and to invite bids. Details of the license offer will be available in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Green Flag Award scheme continues to recognise the importance of our green spaces and the efforts of those who look after them. 2010/11 was the best year yet for the number of awards and long may this continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme has just had its most successful year, with 1,290 green spaces receiving an award and raising the standard: &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712"&gt;www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/News/Default.aspx?newsID=7712&lt;/a&gt; (external link). The Green Flag Community Award category, which recognises those spaces run by voluntary and community groups, saw a 13 per cent increase in winning entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Green Flag Award is the national standard for public green space, currently used by 77 per cent of local authorities for green space management. The awards are increasingly being used by communities to maintain and improve the quality of precious green spaces such as parks, community gardens, woodlands, and allotments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further details about the Green Flag Award scheme and the application round for 2012/2013 can be found at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/Awards/GreenFlag/Default.aspx"&gt;www.keepbritaintidy.org/GreenFlag/Awards/GreenFlag/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt; (external link).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grant Shapps calls on social landlords to help their tenants reduce energy bills</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps today called on councils and housing associations across the country to help their tenants during this time of high energy prices by taking steps that could save each tenant up to £500 a year on energy bills and create thousands of jobs in their local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the countdown to the Government’s Green Deal initiative underway, the Minister urged social landlords to make a positive difference to their tenants’ lives by using existing funding models to start their own ‘Pay As You Save’ scheme, making homes in their area warmer and more comfortable to live in, and at the same time cheaper to run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Shapps pointed to pioneer projects, similar to the Green Deal, which have already started and could be replicated elsewhere. In the largest scheme of its kind in Manchester, the Social Homes Ecofit scheme means improvements such as solid wall insulation and better heating systems are being made to up to 9,000 social homes to make them more energy efficient, at no upfront cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrades could save tenants up to £500 per year on energy bills, and at the same time create more than 1,800 jobs and bring a £100 million boost to businesses in Manchester carrying out the home improvements. Mr Shapps now wants other social landlords to follow their lead, and use every opportunity to improve the lives of their tenants and at the same time bring a much needed economic boost to local economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing Minister Grant Shapps said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our homes count for over a quarter of all UK emissions - it’s essential we do more to make them greener. And at time when tenants are feeling the pinch of high energy prices, it is more important than ever that social landlords use this opportunity to take the simple steps that could save their tenants hundreds of pounds through reduced bills.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Measures such as the Green Deal will make a huge difference to the lives of tenants, and help landlords in their efforts to make their homes cleaner and greener. By making the most of the opportunities that are available now social landlords can get a head start on upgrading their homes and give an immediate shot in the arm to the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In Greater Manchester a number of projects are already underway to improve thousands of homes so tenants can enjoy the benefits of warmer homes and lower energy bills. The scheme will not only reduce tenants’ energy bills but also create hundreds of jobs for local people. So I want other social landlords to learn from their example, and see what they can do to help their tenants and boost local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Green Deal, which will launch in autumn 2012, homeowners and tenants will be able sign up for Green Deal providers to upgrade properties so they become more energy efficient. No money will be paid upfront - instead people will be able to pay for the improvements over time, with the costs to upgrade the property paid back from the savings on energy bills. By allowing the improvements to be paid for gradually, the scheme will remove one of the biggest barriers for retrofitting existing homes - the cost of the initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Social landlords can use their existing powers to vary rents and service charges paid by tenants to gradually recoup a proportion of the upfront costs of the energy efficiency improvements. The increased charges will be offset by lower fuel bills so tenants will still be better off - a ‘Pay As You Save’ model similar to the Green Deal. The remainder of the costs can be met through other existing funding sources such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP), which requires energy suppliers to deliver every saving measures to customers in the most deprived parts of the country; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), which requires the “big six” energy suppliers to make savings in the amounts of carbon dioxide emitted by households, by promoting low-carbon technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

    <title>Stunell and Neville kick off revolution in tackling carbon emissions</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell today joined ex-footballer and sustainability campaigner Gary Neville in Sheffield to open a revolutionary ‘carbon negative’ office - a building that produces more energy than it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister joined Mr Neville, a keen environmentalist and the founder of &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.sustainabilityinsport.com/home.html"&gt;Sustainability in Sport&lt;/a&gt; (external link), to open the open the Old Corn Mill, near Penistone, in West Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of solar panels, two wind turbines and a water turbine powered by the River Don means that the new offices generate surplus energy that is put back into the national grid system, effectively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and giving the building an energy performance rating of A+. The average building in England is rated D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy efficient features at the Old Corn Mill include triple glazing; substantial insulation; low-energy appliances; eco lighting, and underfloor heating using a geothermal water source beneath the car park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally a 1750’s three-story mill, the building has been carefully renovated using existing materials and the latest insulation and energy efficient materials to create a three storey office. The original structure is traditional 1750’s cut stone but a new build extension has been added highlighting the blend of old and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The built environment contributes almost half of the UK’s carbon emissions each year and if UK is to play its part tackling climate change, we need to make our buildings more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This new carbon-negative building is a prime example of how the offices on the future can work - generating not only enough energy to power themselves, but also others - as well as being practical and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability champion Gary Neville said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s great to see offices like this being built. It just shows that businesses as well as individuals can do their bit for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Government Minister Bob Neill responds to an article in the Telegraph claiming that planning reforms will threaten historic towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Hipkin (“It’s not just the countryside that’s at risk, 5 October 2011) is mistaken, the planning reforms will not downgrade protections for the historic environment. They will actually make it clearer and encourage better up keep to prevent neglect or decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft maintains strong protections against urban sprawl and gives local communities the power to decide where to protect or develop through their local plan. Listing buildings and scheduling for ancient monuments will continue. Any development that might cause significant harm to an important heritage asset would not be allowed unless stringent tests were passed to justify any such an exceptional violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents, rightly, expect their council to discharge their legal duties including heritage protection and councils should set their budgets in a way that allows them do that. Despite the huge public deficit funding for councils this year was fair and progressive - the average reduction was just 4.4 per cent. Councils should look to prioritise efficiency savings or share services with neighbouring authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already in discussions with heritage groups about where they think things could be made clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

Our proposals state development needs to be sustainable and satisfy strong environmental safeguards that remain part of the planning system. We’re committed to the new homes and jobs we desperately need but not at the expense of the environment. We want to safeguard the natural environment and we have made this very clear in the draft planning framework, with strong protections for the Green Belt, ancient woodlands, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and many other natural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Government is maintaining strong protections to safeguard the countryside, gardens, the Green Belt and other valued green spaces, including wildlife sites, from urban sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Leaving employment land already zoned for development lying empty for decades, without any prospect of it being put to productive use, is of no benefit to communities. It makes sense to build more homes instead of having industrial and commercial wastelands. The draft framework clearly supports the use of land with the least environmental or amenity value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government stated its commitment to maintaining national Green Belt protection in its first weeks in the Coalition Agreement. The Green Belt has a valuable role in stopping urban sprawl and providing a green lung around towns and cities and this policy is continued in the new draft national planning policy framework.
 &lt;br&gt;
“In addition the proposed abolition of the unpopular Regional Strategies, through the Localism Bill, will remove top-down pressure on councils to review the extent of their Green Belt which was likely to effect more than thirty areas across England. Our new draft planning policy on traveller sites explicitly increases protection for the Green Belt and open countryside.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We utterly reject the accusation that the building of new homes needs to be at the expense of the environment. The draft framework uses the established definition of sustainable development set out by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, and sets out clear environmental protections to ensure that inappropriate development is not approved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The reforms will give much greater power to local people and make sure local plans reflect the needs of their areas in a way which is sustainable. For the first time local people have the chance to have a real say in how their towns and villages are developed, by giving them the power to produce Neighbourhood Plans which will become a formal part of the planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely untrue that there is any threat to allotments as a result of the planning reforms that we’re putting forward. It’s completely the opposite, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Local communities will have the ability in the future to dictate what the local plan for them should be, and to set aside those allotments, and of course existing allotments are protected under legislation at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What we’re trying to make sure happens is that we do have a planning system that can respond to what local communities do want, rather than them always chasing after applications trying to stop things afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building greener homes costing less each year</title>
    <category>News article</category>
    <summary/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building new homes to greener, low-carbon standards is getting cheaper every year, according to a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/codeupdatedcostreview"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published today by Communities Minister Andrew Stunell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new research, based on interviews with developers and the latest information about environmental technologies, shows the overall extra costs of building new homes to standards set in the Code for Sustainable Homes is falling year on year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For homes built to Code level 3 standards, average extra costs have fallen by almost three quarters in the last three years - falling from £4,458 in 2008 to £1,128 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities Minister Andrew Stunell said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Building greener homes is vital if we are to meet our nation’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change - so today’s report is good news for the entire country. The progress that has been made does not only benefit developers building Code-standard homes, it also provides valuable lessons ahead of the transition to building new homes to zero carbon standards from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As a country we still have lot of work to do to reduce carbon emissions from new development, but what these figures show us is that as the construction industry continues to build more sustainable homes, there is further potential for the costs associated building greener homes to continue falling”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Code for Sustainable Homes is the national standard for the sustainable design and construction of new homes. The Code aims to reduce our carbon emissions and create homes that are more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2007, the Code is used to measure the sustainability of new homes against nine design categories, each offering a range of ‘credits’ for meeting sustainability criteria. The more ‘credits’ secured the higher the Code star rating awarded to a development, up to Code level 6.Developers can chose which technologies and approaches they wish to use to minimise their costs and maximise their credits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every year since the Code started in 2007, a short piece of research has been conducted to establish approximately how much different Code standards and components cost, and what the trends are amongst developers in securing Code credits.  This latest report will be the third in the series, and was commissioned last year as part of the impact assessment underpinning the 2010 revision of the Code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The work is based on primary research and interviews with both private and public housing developers, as well as modelling of cost trends across a wide range of environmental building technologies and services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Stunell responds in full to an article in the Sunday Telegraph suggesting that the Government’s planning reforms put the Green Belt in peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion by certain groups that the Government’s planning reforms put the Green Belt in peril is misleading and simply wrong (Furious battle over Green Belt, Sunday, 7 August 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Government is committed to safeguarding the natural and historic environment and has made this very clear in the draft National Planning Policy Framework which protects the Green Belt, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and many other natural areas including ancient woodland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need sustainable growth to provide the jobs and homes we need but this will not be at the expense of the environment. Our streamlining of the planning system does not give the green light to development everywhere and the doomsday scenario being played out by certain groups that reform will wreck the environment does not stack up. Development will be expected to be sustainable and well-designed if it is to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are scrapping the top down Regional Strategies, which threatened to concrete over the Green Belt in more than 30 areas, and introducing a new special protection for green spaces that are most important to local communities, recognising the value of green spaces in both urban and rural areas. In addition, new guidance on traveller sites will increase protection of the Green Belt and open countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These safeguards along with the new planning powers we’re introducing for communities - the people best placed to determine what they need in their area - will not only protect, but will help enhance, the Green Belt and our natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;
