    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Assesses whether the new Business Link website services were performing effectively in their strategic role of digital transformation.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) with an early understanding of whether online business support services provided by Business Link have performed effectively against the strategic objective of ‘digital transformation’.  That is to successfully assist businesses through a website rather than through higher cost services (for example face to face contact). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also makes an early assessment of the value of the services provided to new users, with a focus on cost effectiveness and effective referral to other appropriate business support services in the public, private and third sectors. The support services include the comprehensive start-up service provided by My New Business, and online tools provided by the Growth Improvement Service, enabling businesses to identify and solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="Science and Innovation Network"&gt;SIN&lt;/abbr&gt; officers are scientifically literate staff in &lt;abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; posts who work to benefit the UK through influencing the science and innovation policies of governments, businesses and academia, informing UK policy, and promoting ‘best with best’ collaboration between the UK and other nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report, launched by &lt;abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills"&gt;BIS&lt;/abbr&gt; Permanent Secretary, Martin Donnelly, and &lt;abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; Chief Scientific Advisor, David Clary, at the &lt;abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office"&gt;FCO&lt;/abbr&gt; on 12 December 2012, gives an overview of the &lt;abbr title="Science and Innovation Network"&gt;SIN&lt;/abbr&gt; and highlights some of its achievements over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Assessment of the Business Link helpline</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Provides an early understanding of how effectively the Business Link helpline is performing. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) with an early understanding of whether the Business Link helpline is performing effectively against its strategic objective of ‘digital transformation’, in which more businesses are assisted online rather than through other higher cost provision (for example face-to-face contact). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the research has assessed the value of the service being provided to callers and how far actual demand has matched expectations. The findings are being used to help inform plans for continual improvement of the service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review is based on interviews with helpline staff, analysis of monitoring data, call case studies and a customer survey that consisted of 657 telephone interviews that were completed with customers of the helpline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
