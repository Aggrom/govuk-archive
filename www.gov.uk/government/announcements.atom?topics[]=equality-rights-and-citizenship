    <title>Iranian investigation into death of detained blogger is missed opportunity for justice</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking the 40th day anniversary of the death of Sattar Beheshti, Foreign Officer Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is now forty days since the blogger Sattar Beheshti died in custody in Iran. I would like to use this occasion to extend my condolences to his family. That the Iranian authorities instigated an investigation into Sattar’s tragic death should have been a positive step. However, once again the authorities have failed to deliver justice. Neither Sattar’s family who have reportedly faced harassment and threats from the security services, nor Sattar’s countrymen and women have been given credible answers about the events that led to his death. Instead, the state-controlled media and the parliament have dismissed his death as a heart attack brought on by a fear of arrest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sattar was right to be afraid of the security forces and what could happen to him in jail. The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention. We are deeply disappointed that having taken the initiative to investigate,  Iran has been unwilling to hold those responsible to account. The sacking of the head of Cyber Police will not stop the security and detention forces from operating with impunity. Systemic change is needed to bring about a more transparent and accountable system.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK to contribute funds to Courts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary William Hague has updated parliament on UK contributions to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and the Special Court for Sierra Leone in a written ministerial statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can announce that in order to strengthen international justice and help secure accountability for some of the most horrific crimes against humanity in the last 50 years, the UK will make a voluntary contribution of £1,000,000 to the Special Court for Sierra Leone and a voluntary contribution of £600,000 to the international component of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government’s contribution will help ensure the Special Court for Sierra Leone is able to complete its work, and leave a lasting legacy for the people of Sierra Leone. On 30 May, the Court sentenced Charles Taylor, a former President of Liberia, to 50 years in jail for aiding and abetting war crimes. Taylor is the first former Head of State to be convicted by an international tribunal and the Court is currently hearing his appeal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia is delivering long awaited justice for millions of Cambodians through the trials of the most senior and responsible surviving members of the Pol Pot regime. The scale of the crimes committed and the number of victims makes it one of the most significant tribunals of its kind since Nuremberg. The Government’s contribution will help to prevent the collapse of the Court which has faced a significant shortfall in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International justice is central to foreign policy. It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states, and for securing peace and reconciliation. Through the International Criminal Court, and the separate international tribunals, we are working to make clear that those responsible for the worst crimes will be held to account and that political leaders will not enjoy impunity. Our support to these institutions is an important element in our strategy to reduce conflict, promote stability and strengthen the rules based international system. In order to give Parliament a full accounting of this work we will, from this point forward, also provide an annual statement at the start of the financial year detailing our progress on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCO Minister shows continued UK support to Libyan people on trip to region</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Libya the Minister will offer continued support to the Libyan people as they build a new future after Qadhafi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from Tripoli, Mr Burt said:          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be back in Libya for the third time in twelve months. Since my last visit in April, Libya has held incredibly successful elections, convened a new General National Congress and formed a new Government. I congratulate President Magarief, Prime Minister Zeidan and the Libyan people on these significant achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The new Government faces many challenges: improving security across Libya, particularly taking steps to ensure that armed groups are reintegrated into society, respect government decisions and act within the law; strengthening the justice system to ensure the transfer of all detainees to the custody of the state, where they must be held in accordance with international standards; delivering improved public services to its people; and reforming and revitalising the economy to provide better jobs and opportunities for ordinary Libyans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These challenges are significant but the British Government will continue to support Libya throughout its transition. I am meeting the Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers for Justice and Finance to discuss how the UK can build on its current work to offer even greater assistance to the Libyan Government. I am also meeting a delegation of politicians, business leaders and civil society activists from Benghazi to reiterate our ongoing commitment to the East of Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During these meetings I will emphasise the importance of securing justice for the victims of the Qadhafi regime in the UK, and I look forward to the continued cooperation of the Libyan authorities in resolving these outstanding legacy cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi marks Human Rights Day</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi, will mark International Human Rights Day by hosting the London launch of the United Kingdom’s campaign for election to the United Nations Human Rights Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is standing for election to the UN’s Human Rights Council next year to ensure that the UK is at the forefront of efforts to drive forward the human rights agenda. Calling to account countries that commit the most serious and widespread violations against their own citizens, ensuring the Human Rights Council is at the forefront of the international response to international crises and fighting hard against those who seek to weaken or undermine international human rights mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s campaign will focus on four key human rights priorities: protecting those most vulnerable in societies, working towards human dignity for all, responding proactively to evolving challenges, and keeping human rights at the heart of multilateral priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marking Human Rights Day Baroness Warsi said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“International Human Rights Day is a stark reminder that there are still too many around the world who are not able to enjoy fundamental freedoms. It is important to focus on those who are fighting for their rights and the rights of their loved ones, those who are prepared to put themselves in danger for a better future for others and to remember those who have left a legacy to inspire us all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We must keep those voices at the heart of our efforts to promote and protect human rights around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am proud of the UK’s commitment to protecting those most vulnerable in our societies. Across the world, too many people are discriminated against on the basis of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or gender-identity. The reasons for discrimination are many, and we must tackle the causes and the acts themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking later today at the reception for the London launch of the UK’s campaign for election to the United Nations Human Rights Council, Baroness Warsi will say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe in a Human Rights Council that can make its voice heard, even when the issues are unpopular or difficult to hear. A Council that is not bogged down by politics, but where the rights of the individual are paramount. A body where states are held accountable for their actions against their citizens, where peers review peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe strongly that we have an important role to play, which is why the UK is standing for election. We bring experience, commitment and ambition. We want to play a part in strengthening the Council, as we have since its inception in 2006. In that time the Human Rights Council has grown in status and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Through the Council, we have called to account countries who commit the most heinous and systematic violations against their citizens. We have actively supported the Human Rights Council’s international response to the crisis in Syria. We have also run thematic initiatives including through a resolution which used the Olympics to promote awareness on human rights through sport and established a commitment with the future hosts of the Games to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-affairs-council-and-general-affairs-council"/>
    <title>Foreign Affairs Council and General Affairs Council </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister David Lidington said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I will attend the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 10 December, and I will attend the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 11 December in Brussels. The Foreign Affairs Council will be chaired by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, and the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Cypriot Presidency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="foreign-affairs-council"&gt;Foreign Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-russia-summit"&gt;EU-Russia Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will discuss the EU-Russia Summit which will be held in Brussels on 21 December. Whilst I do not expect conclusions to be issued, we will aim to ensure that this meeting, the 30th such summit, delivers concrete results for the EU in its relationship with Russia. The discussion provides an opportunity for the UK to steer the EU’s objectives for the Summit and to ensure discussion focuses on concrete achievable outcomes, such as: resolution of the Siberian overflight charges; movement on market reform; positive developments in the energy relationship; underlining Member States’ concerns on human rights and democratic standards; and a more effective Partnership for Modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="western-balkans"&gt;Western Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will review the situation in the countries of the Western Balkans, in advance of the discussion of EU enlargement at the GAC the following day. This will be an opportunity to consider the latest developments in the EU-facilitated dialogue between the Prime Ministers of Serbia and Kosovo: the UK welcomes the leadership of Baroness Ashton on this and is keen to see further improvement in the relations between the two sides. There may also be some discussion of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the pace of reform has recently slowed and renewed progress is badly needed, as well as consideration of the situations in Macedonia and Albania. I do not expect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="southern-neighbourhood"&gt;Southern Neighbourhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a discussion on Syria. Further to a UK drive to increase EU support to Syrian civil society, I anticipate that the EEAS will present its vision on how the EU can support civil society in coping with the consequences of the ongoing conflict and better prepare it for political transition. We also expect discussion on the relationship between EU Member States and the newly formed Syrian National Coalition. Having successfully amended the EU arms embargo (and sanctions package) by setting a three-month renewal period, we will make fresh arguments in support of amending the arms embargo ahead of the March 2013 deadline in a way that offers sufficient flexibility to increase practical support to the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministers may also take stock of recent events in Libya, including how to support the priorities of the new Prime Minister, Ali Zidan, and his government which has now taken office. There will be an opportunity to discuss the provision and coordination of international assistance to the new Libyan authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council may discuss events in Egypt following President Mursi’s 22 November Constitutional Declaration. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but we will argue for the EU to respond appropriately to the latest developments and clearly underline support for continued progress towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="middle-east-peace-process"&gt;Middle East Peace Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the Middle East Peace Process will focus on follow-up to the 29 November UN General Assembly Resolution, including the EU’s response to the Israeli decisions to build 3,000 new housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, to unfreeze planning in the area known as E1 and to withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority. EU Ministers will also discuss facilitating a rapid return to credible negotiations in order to secure a two-state solution. We will reiterate our condemnation of the Israeli decision, underlining the threat this poses to the two-state solution, and stress the need to continue work to build on the May FAC conclusions. We will also emphasise the need for the US, with the strong and active support of the EU, to do all it can in the coming weeks and months to take a decisive lead and push the peace process forward urgently. Additionally the UK will stress the need to build on the Gaza ceasefire and to address the underlying causes of the conflict including more open access to and from Gaza for trade as well as humanitarian assistance, and an end to the smuggling of weapons. The UK will support conclusions covering these points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="eu-us"&gt;EU-US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item has been re-scheduled from November’s FAC. Ministers will have the opportunity to discuss the EU’s priorities with the US following the US presidential elections on 6 November and the re-election of President Obama.  I expect the discussion to cover a spectrum of leading international issues, including the global economy and a possible EU-US free trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
We also expect Ministers to agree conclusions on Ukraine and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="general-affairs-council"&gt;General Affairs Council&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a substantial agenda for the GAC in December. There is a legislative deliberation on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union; a presentation by the Commission on the Annual Growth Survey; Preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December; endorsement of the 18 month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece; and a discussion on Enlargement, covering all potential candidates and including the adoption of EU Common positions for the Accession Conference with Iceland. Due to the large agenda, I expect many of these items to be brief and I expect most of the discussion to focus on the preparation for the European Council on 13 and 14 December and on Enlargement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="statute-of-the-court-of-justice-of-the-european-union"&gt;Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot Presidency hopes to secure agreement on a selection method for additional judges at the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union: we have not yet received the final proposal for this.  I remain concerned at the current backlog at the General Court, which is damaging to the interests of British business.  My priorities in the discussion will be: to ensure that there is proportionate common law representation among any additional judges; that the costs of additional judges are covered within existing budgets; and that the selection method provides the Court with the stability it requires to function effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="european-semester-and-the-annual-growth-survey"&gt;European Semester and the Annual Growth Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present key elements of the 2013 annual growth survey which can be found on the Commission’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual growth survey sets out the Commission’s views on the economic priorities for Europe for 2013, focusing on fiscal consolidation, promoting economic growth and employment. The survey, which represents the first stage of the 2013 European Semester, focuses on growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures across the EU.  The European Semester is the EU-wide framework for coordinating structural reforms and growth-enhancing policies. We do not expect this item to be opened for substantive discussion but, in the event that it is, I will be supporting the focus on growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preparation-for-the-december-european-council"&gt;Preparation for the December European Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the December European Council will cover: economic policy, including Economic and Monetary Union and Banking Union; defence; enlargement; and foreign policy. The last two items are covered by the separate sections of this Written Ministerial Statement on enlargement and on the Foreign Affairs Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the European Council meeting will focus on agreeing a legislative framework for Banking Union and an agenda for further Economic and Monetary integration in the Eurozone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the December European Council the Prime Minister will seek to ensure the integrity of the Single Market at 27, including in the context of the Banking Union and the European Banking Authority. We will also press for further progress on growth and ensure that the timetable for further integration in the Eurozone progresses at the right pace and in the right way.  I will argue that these concerns should be addressed prior to the December European Council so that solutions to these issues can be put to leaders on 13 and 14 December.
The December European Council agenda item on defence will pave the way for further discussion in 2013.  I will argue for a focus on developing capabilities, enhancing operational effectiveness and strengthening the European defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-18-month-programme-for-the-presidencies-of-ireland-lithuania-and-greece"&gt;The 18-month programme for the Presidencies of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAC has been asked to endorse the 18-month programme of the Council. This sets out the combined programme for the Irish, Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies of the European Council covering the period January 2013 to June 2014. I expect the programme to be published shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="enlargement"&gt;Enlargement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministers will seek to agree conclusions taking stock of progress on EU enlargement, and on the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans. The Commission released their Annual Enlargement Package on 10 October.  In this communication, the Commission recommended: (i) opening accession negotiations with Macedonia; and (ii) granting Albania candidate status subject to the completion of three specific measures and evidence of continued commitment in the fight against organised crime and corruption. We believe the communication to be a broadly fair and balanced assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek conclusions reconfirming the European Council’s support for EU enlargement and recognising that the accession process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform and reinforces peace, democracy and stability. We agree with the Commission’s view that closer relations with the EU should be based on the principles of delivery on commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality, and good communication with the public. We agree that key challenges remain for most enlargement countries, including in the area of the rule of law. We also support a focus on freedom of expression and regional co-operation, particularly for the Western Balkans countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out the Government’s views on the Commission’s reports in my explanatory memorandum of 18 October. We will seek Council conclusions welcoming Croatia’s continued progress towards meeting all of its commitments in full before its expected accession on 1 July 2013, while reiterating the Commission’s call for Croatia to sharpen its focus to ensure this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will seek conclusions that provide a fair and balanced assessment of Turkey’s progress, which will inject much needed momentum into the process to allow accession negotiations to move forward in 2013. I will argue that Iceland should be commended on the progress made in accession negotiations this year, while recalling the need for Iceland to address existing obligations, such as those identified by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority under the European Economic Area Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also expect the Council to welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro in June 2012, while calling for early progress in the area of the rule of law, in line with the new approach to accession negotiations endorsed by the Council in December 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the FAC discussion of 10 December, the GAC will discuss the Commission’s enlargement package for the Western Balkans countries. We remain fully supportive of a future for all of the Western Balkans countries in the EU, once conditions are met. We want the European Council to commend good progress on reform in Macedonia through the High Level Accession Dialogue, and hope the European Council will be able to build on this by agreeing to the Commission’s fourth successive recommendation to open accession negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a further report from the Commission, the December European Council will not be in a position to grant candidate status to Albania; we will want it to call on Albania to make early progress on reform implementation and establish a track record on tackling organised crime and corruption to enable a decision in 2013. I will argue for Council conclusions that underline that Serbia still needs to make real progress to deliver a “visible and sustainable improvement” in its relations with Pristina before accession negotiations can be opened, while noting that this remains in reach if recent progress continues.  We want the Council to welcome the Commission’s assessment that a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo is feasible and to signal that negotiations should begin as soon as possible.  We agree with the Commission’s assessment that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on its EU agenda has stalled. We will want the Council to press the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress and deliver quickly on those issues they themselves have agreed to, for example, on the EU road map agreed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Conference on freedom of religion or belief </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2011 the UN Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 16/18 on “Combating Intolerance, Negative Stereotyping and Stigmatization of, and Discrimination, Incitement to Violence and Violence Against, Persons Based on Religion or Belief.” The resolution focuses on a number of concrete, practical measures that states can take to combat religious intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s conference brings together experts from governments and civil society across the world to share knowledge and skills focusing on particular parts of resolution 16/18, including;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overcoming obstacles to the equal participation of all groups in society&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;combating intolerance through education&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing collaborative networks between government and civil society &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting the right to freedom of religion or belief is a key human rights priority for the British government.  Freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief is one of the fundamental freedoms that underpins other human rights and is a key building block of any democracy.  It is not only vital to the identity of believers, but to those without a faith too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where individuals are not free to practice their faith, generally other freedoms are under attack too. Governments have a key role to play in creating the conditions for all to practice their religion freely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary discusses Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative </title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman, presenter: New efforts to deal with one of the most horrific consequences of that conflict – mass sexual violence against women.  Britain is about to dispatch a team of doctors, detectives and other experts to the Syrian region to investigate allegations that rape is being used repeatedly and deliberately as a weapon of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brutality in Syria has, according to the United Nations, reached “appalling heights”.  The opposition now fears the uprising has claimed more than 40,000 lives, but as well as the lives lost, there are many thousands of lives ruined too – not by bombs or bullets, but by another weapon of war: rape.  After meeting his team of experts, the Foreign Secretary told this programme that within weeks the Government will be taking the unprecedented step of deploying doctors, investigators, psychologists and lawyers to the Syrian region to gather evidence to bring the perpetrators of rape to justice, evidence likely to be gathered too in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Last week, the M23 rebels marched on the city of Goma.  Both sides are accused of appalling abuses.  Rape has become a fact of life here for 15 years now.  This woman was raped in 2002 by the Hutu militia.  A decade on, she still fears her attackers will return, so her identity has been concealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unnamed woman, victim of military rape [translated]: I don’t know those people, and I don’t know where they are now, and I couldn’t follow up, because if I tried to investigate, those people would come back and they’d kill me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: It’s thought 12% of women in the Congo have been raped at least once, and the figures elsewhere in the world are just as shocking. Up to 50,000 women were raped during the Bosnian conflict in the 1990s; 64,000 women and girls were sexually assaulted in Sierra Leone between 1992 and 2002, and 400,000 were raped during the hundred-day genocide in Rwanda in 1994. Justice for the victims remains elusive, though – only 30 men have been convicted of rape committed during the Bosnian War, and a sense of outrage about that was what persuaded Angelina Jolie, the actress turned UN envoy, to make a film about the Bosnian rape camps, In The Land of Blood and Honey. The Foreign Secretary happened to see it, and says today it inspired him to launch a global campaign to tackle war zone rape, and forge an alliance with one of Hollywood’s biggest stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, William Hague and Angelina Jolie plan to join the experts gathering evidence in the field next year, and earlier I went to speak to both the Foreign Secretary and the Hollywood star at Mr Hague’s official country residence in Chevening in Kent. I began by asking the Foreign Secretary about the deployment to the Syrian region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague (Foreign Secretary): Well, one of the things we will be doing is deploying the team that we’ve now assembled. We’ve assembled a team of 70 doctors, lawyers, forensic experts, psychologists who can be deployed in the field; in the case of Syria, helping Syrian refugees – they’re going to be training local health professionals to gather the medical evidence, to get the forensic evidence and documentation that can be used in prosecutions in the future. So this is a practical example of what we can do, and we’ll be having other deployments over the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Well, you’ve been to many war zones. Do you think it’s realistic, in a war zone, in a war situation, to deploy a team in this way and actually gather evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie (Special Envoy, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees): Absolutely. I think it’s… I think it must be done. I think it’s a… it… you know, I work a lot with refugees, people who are internally displaced, people who have just fled from conflict. I was in the Syria conflict particularly recently, on four different borders, and you meet the people the moment they cross – and they immediately want to start talking. They want to know what’s happening to their future, they want to participate. They want to put on record what’s going on in the country; they want things not to be missed, and they want to know that one day, they’ll be able to go home, and there will be accountability. And so it matters to them emotionally, and it matters to the future of their country on a legal level that they will be able to find some justice and impunity, move forward, and have their basic human rights protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Talking about where this is happening now, it’s really a, kind of, cruel coincidence of timing, isn’t it, that the trouble in the Congo has, sort of, flared up, at just the moment you’re really stepping up this campaign. Is there a sense, do you think, that the M23 rebels, when they marched on Goma, that the UN really stood by and failed in its duty to protect those civilians – some of whom were being raped?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: It’s a very, very complex situation, and I know in particular I reached out to UNHCR, and we talk often about – daily – on reports what’s happening, and I know that the team there on… for UNHCR is extremely frustrated that they can’t access the people, they can’t get to the internally-displaced people because of… because of the violence, until there’s a ceasefire, until there’s a… they actually can’t reach them. That’s a particular part of the UN, that brings aid relief and is able to be present, and they can’t get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Is that your understanding? That it was the practicalities of the issue that meant that the troops weren’t there in sufficient numbers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: Of course, the area we’re talking about, enormous, the numbers of troops very small, the support from neighbouring states – not there; so all of these problems are present there, and the leadership has to come from within the region to sort this out, but the pressure to do that and, if necessary, the resources to help to do that have to come from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: You’ve been to many war zones – Darfur, Iraq, Afghanistan; I’ve missed many, I’m sure – what did you witness there on this particular issue, of rape in the war zone, that really, sort of, inspired you to back this campaign?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: For me, this campaign came about with… we came together on a film I’d worked on that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: The Land of Blood and Honey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: …The Land of Blood and Honey – which came from these years in the field where I’d continued to meet victims of sexual violence who… you know, had just seen no justice, and had felt isolated and abused, and abuse upon abuse because they had felt ignored. But you start to… I started to lean very much towards the law, and to understand that when people don’t know their rights and they don’t know they can fight for it and they don’t have… any rape, any kind of sexual violence that would happen to anybody in this room, the perpetrator would be arrested, we would see justice. Millions and millions of people around the world don’t have that. It’s a shame, and it’s something that… how dare we not do something? So it was helping to give them a voice, and trying to understand myself what more needs to be done to assist them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: And this film is one of the inspirations behind the British Government’s campaign, you know – it’s so good, it’s so clear, it’s so horrifying. It brings to life the statistics. But I think what Angelina achieved with the film was really to bring that to life, to… so that it’s not just something that’s out of mind and out of sight. It removes anybody’s excuse for not doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: And, I mean, there’s so much talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: There’s a lot of bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: There’s a lot of bureaucracy, and there’s a lot of talking, and it just… and when we first started to speak about this, and I learned about the initiative, it was… it wasn’t about, you know, how we can go there together and talk; it was something very practical that had to be done – it was a… ‘there will be an absolute’… you know, ‘there’s people on the ground, there are things being done, there will be results, it will move forward’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Some people might be a little bit cynical, seeing you sat there next to a major Hollywood star. What do you think Angelina Jolie brings to your campaign?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: Well, Angelina was instrumental in the campaign, because – as I mentioned a moment ago – her film about what happened in Bosnia was certainly, to me, one of the main motivating factors in getting this campaign going; but of course she… Angelina brings her experience as an envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, having visited so many countries, and the ability to mobilise opinion and to attract attention to these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: To get it talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: And that’s one of the things that we have to do. This has been a subject that for too long has been not talked about – it’s taboo in some countries to talk about it. It’s not been the main focus of attention, even in countries like our own, in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: And when you hear people’s stories repeatedly over the years, as you have done – obviously their world is so far removed from, you know, the world that we all inhabit. Do you… how do you empathise with what you’re hearing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: How can we live in a world where people are abused in such fashions, where young, you know, girls and boys are being raped so violently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Well, you nod at that – I mean, you’re famously, you know, unemotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: Are you famously unemotional? That’s so interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: The Foreign Secretary has to be, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: I as… am I famously emotional and you’re famously unemotional?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: It’s quite a combination, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: I wasn’t saying you’re famously emotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: That’s…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: It’s quite a combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: That’s why we’re a combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: But, I mean, even you have been… “even you”, I say – OK. You’ve been moved by what you’ve heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Hague: This is one of the worst things happening in the world today, and a world that has mounted campaigns against a slave trade, that is on the edge of agreeing an Arms Trade Treaty ought… is a world which ought to be able to do something about this.  So yes, even the unemotional Foreign Secretary feels very, very strongly about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Do you ever think that what you’re doing on a humanitarian basis is so much more, sort of, time-consuming and more rewarding, potentially, than what you do in your acting, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: Oh, of course. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: All the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: Yeah. Yeah, of course. I mean, I wouldn’t…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Does that ever make you think you’ll give up the acting and focus purely on the…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: I think I’m going to have to give up the acting as the kids hit the teenage years anyway, because… you know.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: Too [unclear].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: There’s going to be too much to manage at home. But…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: That’s [unclear].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: You know, I… you know, I’ve enjoyed being an actress, and I’m so grateful for the job, and I’ve had great experiences, and I’ve even been able to tell stories and be a part of stories that mattered. And I’ve also done really just things for fun and, you know, hopefully… but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy Newman: But you’re speaking in the past tense there, as if from now on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie: I’ll do some films, and I am so fortunate to have the job, you know. It’s a really… it’s a very lucky profession to be a part of, and I enjoy it. But if it went away tomorrow, I’d be very happy to just be home with my children, and I would… you know, I wake up in the morning as a mom, and I turn on the news like everybody else, and I see what’s happening in the world, and I want to be a part of the world in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>This week at the Foreign Office</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h3 id="un-resolution-on-palestine"&gt;UN Resolution on Palestine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary explained that the UK abstained from voting on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;amp;id=840206782" title="Foreign Secretary comment on UN resolution"&gt;UN resolution to recognise Palestine&lt;/a&gt; as a non-member observer state because certain assurances were not received. The Foreign secretary said “We will redouble our efforts to restart the peace process, and will continue our strong support for President Abbas, the Palestinian Authority, and a two state solution” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="preventing-sexual-violence-in-conflict"&gt;Preventing sexual violence in conflict.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foreign office is participating in &lt;a rel="external" href="http://preventsexualviolenceinconflict.tumblr.com/" title="16 days of activism"&gt;16 days of activism&lt;/a&gt; against gender-based violence from 25 November – 10 December, highlighting numerous issues around sexual violence in conflict. The UK has set up a specialist team of experts that will be deployed to conflict areas to support UN missions and local civil society to investigate allegations of sexual violence, gather evidence and help build the capabilities of other nations. This week the Foreign Secretary met with a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;amp;id=840132182" title="Steering group of experts"&gt;steering group of experts&lt;/a&gt; on this issue who are advising the Foreign Office in this area of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="un-general-assembly-resolutions-on-human-rights"&gt;UN General Assembly resolutions on human rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK welcomed several UN resolutions on human rights this week. The Foreign Secretary welcomed the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;amp;id=839289382" title="Foreign Secretary welcomes UN resolution on Syria"&gt;UN resolution on the human right situation in Syria&lt;/a&gt; saying: “The widespread and systematic human rights violations being committed by the Syrian regime and its militia are absolutely appalling and deserve the strongest condemnation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;amp;id=839283882" title="Foreign Office Minister welcomes UN resolution on Iran"&gt;UN resolution on Iran&lt;/a&gt; was welcomed by Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt. He said: “The overwhelming number of votes in support represents a clear statement by the international community that this situation is unacceptable and should be condemned.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK welcomed the resolution on the human rights situation in the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;amp;id=839583982" title=" UK welcomes UN resolution on DPRK"&gt;Democratic People’s Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt; (DPRK) which said that although there had been progress there continue to be reports of widespread and systematic violations of human rights in DPRK. The resolution called upon the DPRK to immediately put an end to systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary met the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister who was here for the Emir of Kuwait’s state visit. The two ministers chaired the first meeting of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;amp;id=839767582" title="UK-Kuwait steering group"&gt;UK-Kuwait joint steering group&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen ties between in important areas like trade and foreign and security policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;amp;id=840146582" title="Bahrain opposition members"&gt;Alistair Burt spoke to Bahrain opposition members&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the current situation in Bahrain. He reiterated the UK’s support for the Declaration of Non-Violence that was launched earlier this month by Al Wefaq and five other political societies, and said “It is an important confidence-building measure and I encourage other leaders in Bahrain to declare publicly their support for this initiative.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="also-this-week"&gt;Also this week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>Foreign Office Minister welcomes UN resolution condemning the human rights situation in Iran</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome yesterday’s adoption of this resolution on the human rights situation in Iran by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. The overwhelming number of votes in support represents a clear statement by the international community that this situation is unacceptable and should be condemned.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Iran’s human rights record remains appalling. The last twelve months have seen multiple violations by the regime of its human rights obligations. There has been widespread use of the death penalty, further curbs on free expression, the increase in targeted harassment of minority groups and worrying reports of mistreatment in custody - in some cases leading to prisoner deaths. These abuses have been compounded by the complete lack of transparency in Iran’s judicial processes and the persistent failure of the regime to observe its own laws and constitution.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tragically, it is not simply those brave men and women who stand up to the regime in defence of human rights who are targeted. Mothers, teachers, Facebook users, ordinary people going about their lives, are affected on a daily basis.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Iran’s actions fail to match its public rhetoric on human rights. It has supported the rights of protest in the Arab world whilst denying those rights to its own people. It encourages dissent elsewhere, yet refuses its own citizens the right to express criticism about Iran or debate the concerns of the international community. The UK will continue to highlight the abuses perpetrated by Iran against its citizens. We expect Iran to live up to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights it freely ratified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK welcomes the success of Sierra Leone’s Presidential, Parliamentary and local multi-party elections, which demonstrates growing political maturity and strengthening stability and security. I would like to congratulate President Koroma on winning re-election to a second term in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This was the first Sierra Leonean election since the civil war which ended in 2002 to be run entirely by national democratic institutions. The UK commends the Sierra Leoneans for their commitment to international standards and the efficient running of the elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The large numbers of Sierra Leone’s citizens who turned out to cast their ballots on 17 November have made their voice clear. We call on all political parties to accept the result. Any remaining concerns with the process should be submitted to the authorities and resolved professionally and peacefully. The UK calls on all parties to continue to abide by the rule of law, renounce violence and incitement to violence and respect human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to continuing our work with President Koroma and his Government in support of progress, sustainable economic development and lasting peace in Sierra Leone and the region.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Secretary marks UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Foreign Secretary William Hague said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Preventing and addressing sexual violence is essential to resolving conflicts and building sustainable peace. In our lifetimes millions of women, children and men have endured this horror.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We must shatter the culture of impunity for those who use rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war and shift the balance of shame away from survivors to the perpetrators of this crime. This is a cause whose time has come, and it will be a major theme of the UK’s Presidency of the G8 next year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By standing shoulder to shoulder with civil society, communities and international organisations I truly believe that we can confront and one day even end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the one year anniversary of the publication of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Establishing the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry was an unprecedented and positive response to the unrest which hit Bahrain in Spring 2011. We fully acknowledge the leadership it took to accept its findings and the commitment made by His Majesty to deliver reforms based on their recommendations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We commend the steps taken so far, including ensuring that the National Security Agency does not have the authority to arrest and detain individuals, the establishment of a Special Investigations Unit to determine the accountability of those who committed unlawful or negligent acts, and the establishment of a Police Ombudsman to receive complaints and grievances and to oversee and conduct investigations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we are concerned by some of the recent decisions taken by the Bahraini Government, particularly on human rights, and we’re clear that there are areas where progress on implementation has been too slow and others where it is lacking. Much more needs to be done on relaxing censorship and allowing the opposition greater access to media, on integrating personnel from all communities in Bahrain into the security forces, and question marks remain on senior level accountability for the deaths and the allegations of torture following the unrest of 2011. The Bahraini Government has itself acknowledged that more work still needs to be done and the UK stands ready and willing to assist in whatever way we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Commission’s report revealed deep-rooted issues that pose significant challenges for the Bahraini Government and will take time to fully address, as will a change in behaviour and culture. There have also been increasingly violent protests on the streets, which are unacceptable. As Bahrainis today mark the first anniversary of the landmark BICI report, we urge the Bahraini Government to show a renewed sense of energy and commitment to implementing all the recommendations, and we call on all community leaders to play a constructive role in this process for the long-term stability of the Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>International meeting on support to the Syrian Opposition</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking after meeting the Leaders of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces and opening an international meeting on support to the Coalition, the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today I met the President and Vice President of the new National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces in their first visit to Europe since the Coalition’s establishment in Doha a few days ago. They are very welcome here in London and we had a detailed discussion on how the Coalition will make progress now. The situation in Syria, of course, is very grave and deteriorating. More than 30,000 people have now died, hundreds of thousands are refugees in neighbouring countries, many hundreds of thousands are displaced within Syria and millions need humanitarian assistance. So we want to continue to step up our assistance to the people of Syria”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The formation of the Coalition is a very encouraging development and I’m further encouraged by the discussions that I have had with them this morning. It is important, of course, and I have stressed to them: that they respect minority rights; that they are inclusive of all communities in Syria; that they are committed to a democratic future for the people of Syria; that in the face of a regime that has committed such abuse, violence and rape against the people of their own country this Coalition stands firmly against all of those things; and that they uphold high standards of human rights, of international humanitarian law, preventing sexual violence and the preventing abuse of prisoners”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These things are very important to their future and to international support for them. I am encouraged by their response and by meeting Sheikh al Khatib the President of the Coalition and I welcome the commitment that he has made to reach out to all opposition groups and communities in Syria, to respect human rights, to finalise a clear plan for political transition in Syria and, of course, to demonstrate that the coalition can be a credible political alternative to the Assad regime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is still a lot of work to be done. In depth discussions will now take place here in London today with a wide range of countries about how we can channel assistance more effectively to the people of Syria and build up our links with the new coalition. The meeting today will focus on the practicalities of those things”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will have further discussions in the European Union on Monday in Brussels, which I will attend, about Syria and about the assistance we can give to the Coalition and to the people of Syria, and I will make a further statement to the House of Commons next week about our approach. But I hope that today and this meeting will mark a turning point for the Syrian people and that it will begin major steps towards a political transition in Syria”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So I am encouraged by what I have heard and seen from the leaders of the Coalition and I hope the discussions in London today will bring greater assistance to tens of thousands of people suffering today in Syria. Thank you very much”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On recognition of the opposition the Foreign Secretary added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I discussed with the Coalition this morning the question of recognition. We would like to be able at an early stage to recognise them as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. One or two countries have already done so. I wanted to meet them myself before the United Kingdom takes that step. We need their assurances about being inclusive of all communities, we need to see that they have genuine support within Syria. And if we are going to take that important step of recognition we should do so in full possession of the facts and on the basis of discussions with them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So the meeting we have had today is an important component of that and we’ll continue to work on this over the next few days and I will make a further statement to our Parliament about this next week”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the National Security Council the Foreign Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In our National Security Council yesterday we reviewed all the options on Syria. We don’t rule out any option on Syria, but we are conscious that this ultimately needs, whatever happens, a diplomatic and political solution. A military victory of one side over the other would be a long, expensive process in terms of human life. And so our top priority remains to achieve a diplomatic and political solution and that remains our position”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will discuss the way forward with European Union colleagues on Monday and also with Arab nations and with the United States, now the American elections are over”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We cannot stand still, we cannot just say that we will leave things as they are in Syria because it is a gravely deteriorating situation. But how we respond has to be well judged, well thought through and so at the moment our priorities are to increase our humanitarian assistance as we have done in recent weeks, to better coordinate our practical support to people in opposition held areas on the ground, and to keep up the pressure for a diplomatic solution”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Confronting rape as a weapon of war: a challenge for our generation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each generation faces its own challenges, and each can shape our world for the better.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our generation has the opportunity, and the responsibility, to confront the use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our lifetimes millions of women, children and men have endured this horror, including in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia, Uganda, Liberia and in Bosnia, where only twenty years ago, on European soil, rape camps were set up and tens of thousands of women subjected to sexual slavery and enforced pregnancy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that preventing and addressing sexual violence is vital to resolving conflicts and building sustainable peace. I see it as a vast international issue that national foreign policies have not yet adequately addressed. And I am convinced that we can actually do something more about it. That is why I am championing it as Foreign Secretary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my Party was still in Opposition I met survivors of rape in refugee camps in Darfur and in Srebrenica. Last month I returned to Bosnia and spent time with female and male survivors in Sarajevo, and I recently shared a platform with people working with survivors of rape and torture in the DRC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experiences brought home to me the sheer extent and intensity of the problem, the overwhelming lack of justice for survivors of wartime rape and sexual violence despite a huge amount of excellent work by grassroots organisations and NGOs, and the direct link that this has with peace and security today. Where there is no justice or dignity for survivors development is held back, and the seeds of future conflict are sown.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approach this subject with a good deal of humility, as a man, and as someone who has not experienced conflict first hand or worked with survivors. But I have been appalled by the toll sexual violence in conflict has on children. To take just one example, of the thousands of reported rapes in the DRC in one recent period, up to 50% of all survivors were under the age of 17, and 10% were under the age of 10.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been struck by the terrible life sentence of trauma, stigma and illness that follows in the wake of rape in war, and its impact on families and communities. This was illustrated to me by the fact that 67% of survivors in Rwanda were subsequently found to be HIV positive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have been deeply affected by the knowledge that many victims never get the recognition or support they are entitled to, eking out a precarious existence in conflict zones with their abusers often still at large in their communities.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a tendency in the past to regard sexual violence as an inevitable by-product of conflict, something that happens in the ‘fog of war’ when law and order breaks down.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, we have treated sexual violence either as an issue of marginal importance in peace agreements which often tend to exclude women, or to see it as a global problem that is too immense for us to do anything about it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to change. We now know that rape and sexual violence is used as a deliberate weapon of war in the same way that guns and tanks are, to terrorise civilian populations, to humiliate, scar and destroy whole ethnic groups or religious or political opponents, cheaply, silently and devastatingly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simply accept that this is part of the cycle of war is to consign hundreds of thousands of innocent people to an appalling fate in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am convinced from my own experiences as Foreign Secretary over the last two and a half years that our failure to confront this issue does play a part in emboldening those who are orchestrating atrocities today, including in Syria. Our efforts to prevent rape in war have to be as determined as our efforts to prevent conflict in the first place.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the reasons why this issue matters to me and has a direct bearing on foreign policy. But there are also two factors which explain why I think the conditions are right for a major new international initiative, and why I am personally optimistic about our chances.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that we have developed an impressive array of mechanisms at the UN and national level over the last decade, including UN Security Council Resolutions 1325, 1820, 1888 and 1960, the office of the UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the various UN teams of experts, new mechanisms to train peacekeepers, and National Action Plans on Women Peace and Security, which include protections for violence against women and girls. Our understanding of these issues has been transformed over the last decade and we have a far wider range of capabilities to bring to bear against this problem. In the United Kingdom we are determined to champion women’s rights in all the UN bodies, and to be vigilant and outspoken against any attempt to undermine the gains that have now been secured.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And second, I believe that a critical mass of public opinion has now begun to build up in many countries against the use of sexual violence in conflict. My experience as a politician leads me to believe that this is the moment to mobilise global public opinion and to rally the efforts of nations, in the same way that we have mustered the will to ban the use of landmines and cluster munitions, and are on the verge of securing an international Arms Trade Treaty. Shattering the culture of impunity for those who use rape as a weapon of war is the next great global challenge of our generation. It is a cause whose time has come.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is overwhelmingly due to years of work by the UN and its agencies, by NGOs, the International Criminal Court and other international tribunals and brave survivors who have felt able to share their stories with a shocked world. I am also conscious that many other countries have shown leadership in this area, including many that have emerged from conflict themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also benefited greatly from the insights of filmmakers, who have shone a light on painful events and helped us to understand our responsibilities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such Director is Jasmila Zbani?, who allowed us to screen her film ‘Emma’s Story’ during this conference.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another is Angelina Jolie.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you will be familiar with her work as Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was my encounter earlier this year with her film In the Land of Blood and Honey that actually galvanised me into starting this new British initiative, and led to her joining me at our event in the Foreign Office in May when I announced it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very grateful to Angelina Jolie for her support for our efforts to combat the terrible suffering she depicted so powerfully in her film, and for joining us again today.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She assures me she is here to meet you and to listen to our discussion, but I also think she may also be checking up on whether we have lived up to our promises.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we are making some strong and encouraging progress with your help. And our ambition and resolve is even greater than when we first began this initiative, because of the overwhelmingly positive reception it has received around the world.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are focussing our efforts on accountability and justice, and on increasing the number of prosecutions for these crimes. This is the area where there is the most glaring lack of political will, where I believe governments like our own can make the most difference, and where we must act if we are to erode the culture of impunity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May I announced that Britain would set up a specialist team of experts that can be deployed to conflict areas to support UN missions and local civil society to investigate allegations of sexual violence, to gather evidence and to help build up the capabilities of other nations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, six months later we have recruited 70 people for this team already, which includes police, lawyers, psychologists, doctors, forensic experts, gender-based violence experts and experts in the care and protection of survivors and witnesses. I will shortly be able to announce its first deployment which will begin before the end of this year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each deployment will be tailored to meet local needs and circumstances. The deployments will be based on in-depth assessments of national and international responses in that country to date and how the British team could reinforce or complement existing efforts, as well as consultations with the authorities in each country.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also pledged six months ago that we would use our Presidency of the G8 in 2013 to secure new commitments from some of the world’s most powerful nations. Be in no doubt, we really mean business about this. By the time our Presidency actually starts in January, we will already have spent seven months building support for our objectives before we begin negotiations in earnest. My colleagues around the world know already that it will be one of my top priorities for the meeting of G8 Foreign Ministers in April.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have proposed new G8 partnerships with conflict-affected countries, and a new International Protocol on the investigation and documentation of sexual violence in conflict. I welcome the fact that Mr Brammertz flagged up this issue yesterday, when he said that we need a standardised set of guidelines for effective prosecutions. This would be a practical response to the need to improve the evidence base for prosecutions for sexual violence in conflict at the national and international level, and it would draw on existing advice and guidelines. We want any new Protocol to be of genuine value to national authorities in their efforts to seek prosecutions. If adopted, it could be used in training and capacity building programmes, ensuring an enduring legacy which we would hope to expand beyond the G8 over time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these areas our Government is not looking to reinvent the wheel - but we are saying that we are prepared to put Britain’s shoulder to it as never before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not want to duplicate or cut across the work that has been done by experts - but we do want to set an example to the world of what governments can do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are one of the few countries in the world that can lead such an effort. We have a network of 260 diplomatic posts around the globe, one of the most extensive of any nation. We have one of the largest programmes of international development aid in the world. We are members of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the EU and the Commonwealth as well as our G8 role, all of which gives us the ability - as well as the responsibility - to take this cause to many of the most influential multilateral bodies in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have set up an excellent new team of Foreign Office officials led by Emma Hopkins to oversee all our efforts. She and her colleagues have already visited Japan, France, Germany, the US, Canada, China, South Korea and international human rights organisations in Geneva, The Hague and the European Union, to discuss our proposals and mobilise support for our G8 campaign. I think their work will become a model for how other Foreign Ministries can increase their capabilities in this area, particularly in the way it draws on wide expertise from DfID and the Home Office as well as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sign of our determination to reinforce and not duplicate existing efforts, we are working closely with the UN Team of Exports on Rule of Law and Sexual Violence that supports the office of the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Mrs Zainab Bangura.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July I announced that we have donated £1 million over two years to the ICC’s groundbreaking mechanism to help victims rebuild their lives, the Trust Fund for Victims. The projects the Fund supports in Uganda, DRC and elsewhere are based on the understanding that it is impossible fully to undo the damage caused by war crimes, including sexual violence. However it is possible to help empower survivors to rebuild their families and regain their place as contributing members of their society.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New York in September I announced an increase in British support for the UN Special Representative’s work, with £1 million of funding over the next three years. I welcome the greater emphasis that she is placing on national ownership, leadership and responsibility. And I think we must also promote a more ‘strategic’ use of international effort to support UN work to combat impunity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am announcing today that we will contribute £375,000 over a three year period to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support to develop policies, guidance and training for use by peacekeepers as first responders to incidents of sexual violence.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are urging other countries to match our voluntary contributions in each of these areas. We will do all of these things and more, but of course we look to you to give us your help, advice, constructive criticism and support.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are among the world’s leading experts in the field of combating wartime rape and sexual violence, with deep knowledge and personal experience. I am extremely grateful to you all for travelling a long way to be here and for sharing your expertise with us, and I want to pay particular tribute to Special Representative Bangura and her predecessor Margot Wallstrom.&lt;br&gt;
We need your help to ensure that we have set the right level of ambition for the G8, to ensure that we are aiming high enough and that our proposals are drawn up to have the maximum possible impact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already drawn five important conclusions from your discussions over the last two days.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, justice has got to be viewed in its fullest sense. It means many things to survivors, ranging from access to justice and effective remedy at the local and national level, reparation, medical care and support to rebuild lives, and it can also involve restorative justice and truth commissions as well as prosecutions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we must conceptualise sexual violence in its broadest sense, in terms of women’s rights, education and participation. It is part of a much broader effort to address violence against women and girls and to empower women across society.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we need better coordination of current efforts, across the silos that can set in between our humanitarian, security and developmental efforts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, we have to build up national ownership by matching international efforts much more closely to national requirements and building up national capacity. In my mind this must include how we work to bridge the gap between international efforts and the grass roots organisations which work on the ground, understand the grain of the society, and have the trust of local people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we need to shift the balance of shame away from survivors to the perpetrators of this crime. We need to break down the stigma by talking about it, which is something I am attempting to do as Foreign Secretary in my conversations around the world. And we have to recognise that unless we shift attitudes amongst men that rape is not a family matter, it is a violent crime, then the problem will persist.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am extremely grateful to you for taking part in this conference, and I will study your detailed recommendations. It is my sincere hope that you will continue to work with us over the coming year, giving us guidance and honest advice when you think we can do more. And I particularly hope you will feel able to work us with to build public momentum around our G8 campaign in 2013 and beyond, so that each country can feel the campaign in their own parliaments and media.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this will be our approach: increasing our own capabilities in the British Foreign Office, significantly increasing our support to UN efforts, raising the profile of the need to confront sexual violence in conflict in every way we can, and proposing new action that we hope will be adopted by many nations  in a new collective effort for our generation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been inspiring to meet many people around the world who share our sense of hope and ambition. On the rare occasion that I am met with a sceptical smile, I remind people of the 18th century slave trade. Although slavery is still with us in modern variants, our predecessors exploded the belief that slavery was in the natural order of things, and a problem too complex to be tackled. And I also remind people that even if our action only succeeds in making a difference at the margins of this vast problem, it could mean that thousands of vulnerable people are spared this appalling violation.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survivors I have met have made a great impression on me by their courage to speak about their experiences and to live, raise families and hold their heads high. By standing shoulder to shoulder with civil society, communities and international organisations I believe we can match the courage of these survivors with a new international resolve to confront and one day even end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Wilton Park conference on preventing sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Foreign Secretary will attend and deliver the keynote speech on the final afternoon of a Wilton Park Conference on “Preventing sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following his announcement in May that Britain would set up a specialist team of experts that could be deployed to conflict areas to support UN missions and local civil society to investigate allegations of sexual violence, gather evidence and help build the capabilities of other nations, the Foreign Secretary will today announce that the specialist team now consists of 70 people and is ready to deploy overseas in the near future.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those recruited for the team include police, lawyers, psychologists, doctors, forensic experts, gender-based violence experts and experts in the care and protection of survivors and witnesses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Secretary will also announce additional funding of more than £¼ million over a three year period to the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support to develop policies, guidance and training for use by UN peacekeepers as first responders to incidents of sexual violence.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the conference, the Foreign Secretary said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe that a critical mass of public opinion has now begun to build up against the use of rape as a weapon of war in many countries. My experience as a politician leads me to believe that this is the moment to mobilise global public opinion and to rally the efforts of nations, in the same way that we have mustered the will to ban the use of landmines and cluster munitions, and are on the verge of securing an international Arms Trade Treaty. Shattering the culture of impunity for those who use rape as a weapon of war is the next great global challenge of our generation. It is a cause whose time has come.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants at today’s conference are drawn from over 25 countries and include ministers and senior practitioners and experts.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference which includes sessions on the international normative framework; addressing impunity; early warning indicators; strengthening justice mechanisms; and communications, was also attended by the following:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mrs Zainab Bangura, UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Margot Wallstrom, the former Special Representative&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Madeleine Rees, Secretary-General of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serge Brammertz, a prosecutor from the ICTY&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angelina Jolie, Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angelina Jolie, Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be working with Foreign Secretary Hague again on the United Kingdom’s initiative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict. In many conflicts, sexual violence is used as a tactic of war, intended to hurt not only a single individual, but their family, their community, their ethnic group. Today this  has almost become a rule rather than an exception, and we all must work together to combat the impunity and ensure justice for the victims.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Baroness Warsi hails Malala’s inspirational activism</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the UK’s role in supporting Pakistan in improving education access, Baroness Warsi reinforced the UK’s support for more support for education for girls in school.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baroness Warsi, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Through her inspirational activism Malala has bravely highlighted the need for education to be accessible to all children in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Education is the single most important factor that can transform Pakistan’s future. Currently, half the adult population can’t read or write, and more than twelve million children are not in school. The problem for women is more acute; nearly two thirds of women in Pakistan can’t read or write. Girls’ education is a priority for the UK Government’s programme in Pakistan.  It is important to ensure that girls have an education in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The UK is supporting up to four million children in school and is training up to 45,000 teachers. All of our programmes a have an emphasis on women and girls and aim to tackle the low levels of girls’ enrolment in primary schools.  Additionally in the part of Pakistan that Malala is from, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, we support the provincial governments to increase girls’ attendance at school, through the use of stipends and vouchers, the provision of free textbooks, and improving school facilities to make sure they are safe and appropriate for girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Concern for Iranian human rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the case of Nasrin Sotoudeh, who remains imprisoned in Iran, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa Alistair Burt said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply concerned for the well being of Nasrin Sotoudeh, the Iranian human rights defender imprisoned in Iran. Last week, she was a worthy winner of the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. I understand that she is on hunger strike in protest at the harassment of her family by the Iranian regime. I urge the Iranian authorities to cease the activities that have led Nasrin Soutoudeh to take this drastic step and to review her case and the baseless charges against her.”&lt;/p&gt;
