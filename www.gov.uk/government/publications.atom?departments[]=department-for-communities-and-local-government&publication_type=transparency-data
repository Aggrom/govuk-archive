    <title>DCLG business plan quarterly indicators: January 2013</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>Input and impact indicators set out in the DCLG business plan 2012 to 2015.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table shows the latest figures for the input and impact indicators set out in the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dclg-business-plan-2012-to-2015"&gt;DCLG business plan 2012 to 2015&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCLG has adopted these indicators to help the public assess the effects of policies and reforms on the cost and impact of public services. The individual indicators are unique to DCLG.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second time that the business plan indicators have been published separately from the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/dclg-business-plan-quarterly-data-summaries"&gt;quarterly summary management data&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <summary>Workforce information for the Department for Communities and Local Government and its agencies and public bodies.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the workforce management data for November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures are not official statistics. They are internal workforce management information published in the interests of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures have not been reconciled centrally with any National Statistics. Where differences appear between the monthly information and National Statistics, clarifying comments will be provided. The Office for National Statistics’ quarterly public sector employment statistics provide an official headline measure for comparing the overall size of employment in central government organisations with other sectors of the economy at the relevant quarterly reference point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some organisations may not have information available for each month, and at this stage coverage may therefore not reach 100% for those organisations in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the wide range of organisations covered, caution should be exercised when drawing inferences from the figures and care should be taken when making comparisons between organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>DCLG spending data: October 2012</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary>DCLG spending report and the Government Procurement Card spending report for October 2012.</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HM Treasury requires that all central government departments publish details of their spending for transactions over £25,000, and publish monthly data by the last day of each month. This department has lowered its threshold and publishes its transactions over £250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available below are the spending report and the Government Procurement Card spending report for October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points to note on this report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;over £250 transparency spending data is taken from SAP’s general ledger payment transactions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as required by HM Treasury, the data relates to accounts payable payments and credit note transactions for grants and procurement expenditure, recorded at the time the transaction was processed on SAP. The data excludes any subsequent journal transactions and accounts receivable receipts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;travel, subsistence and other employee transactions - these are currently published on a summarised anonomised basis. They are summarised by ‘Expense area’, then ‘Expense type’, by day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the terms ‘localism’ and ‘neighbourhoods’ in the spreadsheets refer to groups within DCLG. They cover policy areas such as housing, planning and local government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data is published in CSV and Excel formats in payment date sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>DCLG business plan quarterly data summary: quarter 1 2012 to 2013</title>
    <category>Publication</category>
    <summary></summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new quarterly data summary framework departments’ spending data is published every quarter; to show the taxpayer how the government is spending their money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="quarterly data summary"&gt;QDS&lt;/abbr&gt; grew out of commitments made in the 2011 Budget and the written ministerial statement on business plans. For the financial year 2012 to 2013 the &lt;abbr title="quarterly data summary"&gt;QDS&lt;/abbr&gt; has been revised and improved in line with Action 9 of the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform"&gt;Civil Service Reform Plan&lt;/a&gt; to provide a common set of data that will enable comparisons of operational performance across government so that departments and individuals can be held to account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="quarterly data summary"&gt;QDS&lt;/abbr&gt; breaks down the total spend of the department in 3 ways: by budget, by internal operation and by transaction. At the moment this data is published by individual departments in Excel format, however, in the future the intention is to make this data available centrally through an online application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time we will be making further improvements to the quality of the data and its timeliness. We expect that with time this process will allow the public to better understand the performance of each department and government operations in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;abbr title="quarterly data summary"&gt;QDS&lt;/abbr&gt; template is the same for all departments, though the individual detail of grants and policy will differ from department to department. In using this data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People should ensure they take full note of the caveats noted in each department’s return.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the improvement of the &lt;abbr title="quarterly data summary"&gt;QDS&lt;/abbr&gt; is an ongoing process data quality and completeness will be developed over time and therefore necessary caution should be applied to any comparative analysis undertaken. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We support the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/local-public-data-panel"&gt;Local Public Data Panel&lt;/a&gt;, chaired by Professor Nigel Shadbolt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was established to help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the release of local public data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;information sharing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set common standards for releasing data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make local public services better understood and more accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel aims to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure understanding of the case for making local public data freely available for re-use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promote innovative uses of local public data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sponsor the further development of a single place on line at &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk/"&gt;data.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; for all public sector data, while meeting the specific needs of the local government sector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encourage agreed standards for greater data and information sharing by local strategic partnerships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel operates a &lt;a rel="external" href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/local-public-data-panel"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; where you can see activity and read the minutes of their meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="making-a-difference-with-data"&gt;Making a Difference with Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.madwdata.org.uk/"&gt;Making a Difference with Data&lt;/a&gt; initiative aims to raise awareness about how you can access data from local public services such as local authorities, the police and the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it to raise issues, campaign, and influence decision-making in your local community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative brings together stories and examples showing how local information and data is being used to make a difference in important areas. The initiative is funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) in partnership with Improvement and Efficiency West Midlands (IEWM) and is supported by the Local Public Data Panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent project under this initiative, DCLG, in partnership with the London Borough of Lambeth, has developed an &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.lambeth-in-numbers.co.uk/login"&gt;on-line tool&lt;/a&gt; to demonstrate how better access to information can help improve policy and decision-making at the local level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool will be used to stimulate further debate in Lambeth and other local authorities about open data.  We want this to help councils and their residents and communities understand what data is available and how they can use it to influence local public services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
