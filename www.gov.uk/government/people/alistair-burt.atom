    <title>Iranian investigation into death of detained blogger is missed opportunity for justice</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking the 40th day anniversary of the death of Sattar Beheshti, Foreign Officer Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is now forty days since the blogger Sattar Beheshti died in custody in Iran. I would like to use this occasion to extend my condolences to his family. That the Iranian authorities instigated an investigation into Sattar’s tragic death should have been a positive step. However, once again the authorities have failed to deliver justice. Neither Sattar’s family who have reportedly faced harassment and threats from the security services, nor Sattar’s countrymen and women have been given credible answers about the events that led to his death. Instead, the state-controlled media and the parliament have dismissed his death as a heart attack brought on by a fear of arrest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sattar was right to be afraid of the security forces and what could happen to him in jail. The bruises on his body – which the authorities have abjectly failed to explain – are almost certainly a result of mistreatment and brutality that he – like so many others – suffered in detention. We are deeply disappointed that having taken the initiative to investigate,  Iran has been unwilling to hold those responsible to account. The sacking of the head of Cyber Police will not stop the security and detention forces from operating with impunity. Systemic change is needed to bring about a more transparent and accountable system.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Piracy Ransoms Task Force publishes recommendations</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force was established by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, after the London Conference on Somalia in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14-nation Task Force, brought together policy makers from some of the world’s largest Flag States (countries where vessels are registered), nations whose seafarers are most commonly at risk, and those countries at the forefront of the military response to piracy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Task Force made four recommendations in its final report to the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia in New York:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a new strategic partnership between Flag States, the private sector and law enforcement agencies that brings together those tackling piracy and those subjected to it in a united effort to break the piracy business model;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a more co-ordinated approach to information-sharing to provide evidence to pursue and prosecute all involved in piracy;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strengthen co-ordination between Flag States, the private sector and military responders to prepare for potential hostage situations; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage implementation of anti-piracy measures, including greater compliance with Best Management Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister, David Cameron, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s conclusions from the Piracy Ransoms Task Force are a welcome step in the right direction. International action, led by the UK, is starting to beat back in the global fight against piracy. The dramatic reduction in pirate activity in the past year shows how important collective action is, and the recommendations of the Task Force should make it harder for pirates to receive, and to profit from, ransom payments. But seafarers of all nations remain at risk, and we must continue to work to break the piracy business model, with the ultimate ambition of bringing an end to ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK Government firmly supports and endorses the conclusions of the Piracy Ransoms Task Force. Only through the international community working together to break the pirates’ business model will we reach a position whereby pirates are no longer able to receive or profit from ransom payments. The Government will continue to work as a leading member of the Contact Group and with industry in taking forward the implementation of the task force’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCO Minister shows continued UK support to Libyan people on trip to region</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Libya the Minister will offer continued support to the Libyan people as they build a new future after Qadhafi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking from Tripoli, Mr Burt said:          &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be back in Libya for the third time in twelve months. Since my last visit in April, Libya has held incredibly successful elections, convened a new General National Congress and formed a new Government. I congratulate President Magarief, Prime Minister Zeidan and the Libyan people on these significant achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The new Government faces many challenges: improving security across Libya, particularly taking steps to ensure that armed groups are reintegrated into society, respect government decisions and act within the law; strengthening the justice system to ensure the transfer of all detainees to the custody of the state, where they must be held in accordance with international standards; delivering improved public services to its people; and reforming and revitalising the economy to provide better jobs and opportunities for ordinary Libyans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These challenges are significant but the British Government will continue to support Libya throughout its transition. I am meeting the Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers for Justice and Finance to discuss how the UK can build on its current work to offer even greater assistance to the Libyan Government. I am also meeting a delegation of politicians, business leaders and civil society activists from Benghazi to reiterate our ongoing commitment to the East of Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During these meetings I will emphasise the importance of securing justice for the victims of the Qadhafi regime in the UK, and I look forward to the continued cooperation of the Libyan authorities in resolving these outstanding legacy cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foreign Office Minister welcomes UN resolution condemning the human rights situation in Iran</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I welcome yesterday’s adoption of this resolution on the human rights situation in Iran by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. The overwhelming number of votes in support represents a clear statement by the international community that this situation is unacceptable and should be condemned.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Iran’s human rights record remains appalling. The last twelve months have seen multiple violations by the regime of its human rights obligations. There has been widespread use of the death penalty, further curbs on free expression, the increase in targeted harassment of minority groups and worrying reports of mistreatment in custody - in some cases leading to prisoner deaths. These abuses have been compounded by the complete lack of transparency in Iran’s judicial processes and the persistent failure of the regime to observe its own laws and constitution.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tragically, it is not simply those brave men and women who stand up to the regime in defence of human rights who are targeted. Mothers, teachers, Facebook users, ordinary people going about their lives, are affected on a daily basis.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Iran’s actions fail to match its public rhetoric on human rights. It has supported the rights of protest in the Arab world whilst denying those rights to its own people. It encourages dissent elsewhere, yet refuses its own citizens the right to express criticism about Iran or debate the concerns of the international community. The UK will continue to highlight the abuses perpetrated by Iran against its citizens. We expect Iran to live up to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights it freely ratified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the one year anniversary of the publication of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Establishing the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry was an unprecedented and positive response to the unrest which hit Bahrain in Spring 2011. We fully acknowledge the leadership it took to accept its findings and the commitment made by His Majesty to deliver reforms based on their recommendations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We commend the steps taken so far, including ensuring that the National Security Agency does not have the authority to arrest and detain individuals, the establishment of a Special Investigations Unit to determine the accountability of those who committed unlawful or negligent acts, and the establishment of a Police Ombudsman to receive complaints and grievances and to oversee and conduct investigations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we are concerned by some of the recent decisions taken by the Bahraini Government, particularly on human rights, and we’re clear that there are areas where progress on implementation has been too slow and others where it is lacking. Much more needs to be done on relaxing censorship and allowing the opposition greater access to media, on integrating personnel from all communities in Bahrain into the security forces, and question marks remain on senior level accountability for the deaths and the allegations of torture following the unrest of 2011. The Bahraini Government has itself acknowledged that more work still needs to be done and the UK stands ready and willing to assist in whatever way we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Commission’s report revealed deep-rooted issues that pose significant challenges for the Bahraini Government and will take time to fully address, as will a change in behaviour and culture. There have also been increasingly violent protests on the streets, which are unacceptable. As Bahrainis today mark the first anniversary of the landmark BICI report, we urge the Bahraini Government to show a renewed sense of energy and commitment to implementing all the recommendations, and we call on all community leaders to play a constructive role in this process for the long-term stability of the Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>FCO Minister condemns violence and calls for peaceful progress in Bahrain</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minister for the Middle East and North Africa said:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This week I spoke to the Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa ahead of the first anniversary of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) report into the uprising in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed the recent increase in violent attacks, which are deeply worrying and only serve to undermine prospects for reconciliation and long-term stability in Bahrain. The UK condemns any group that engages in this type of violent action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome the constructive steps taken last week by Al-Wefaq and five other opposition political societies to condemn violence in a Declaration of Principles of Non-violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to encourage the Government to lift the temporary ban on protests, and urge all sides to pursue their objectives through peaceful action and meaningful dialogue.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Foreign Office Minister welcomes Middle East champions of reform to UK</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme, funded by the FCO’s Arab Partnership programme, promotes good governance and the rule of law in the Middle East and follows a successful pilot project last year. It is part of a major UK Government policy initiative to assist those countries in the Middle East which are working to create more open and pluralistic societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the meeting Minister Burt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today I met 17 inspirational individuals who are helping drive reform across the region. Each has a unique story and I am proud that the UK’s visionary Arab Partnership programme has been able to join with the John Smith Memorial Trust to help nurture and support their commitment to forging the foundations of democracy and accountability in their own countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A year ago a policewoman from Lebanon was part of this innovative project. Today thanks to the JSMT and Foreign Office funding she is championing equality and diversity in the Lebanese police force. It is this sort of work that, as countries across the Middle East chart their own individual journeys in the wake of the Arab Spring, will help ensure open societies which deliver stability and prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JSMT project shows how democracy can be a successful tool for securing good governance, for making the Rule of Law effective by advancing citizens’ human and legal rights, for empowering disadvantaged groups and for giving a voice to those who currently lack political influence. It is founded on the principle that Middle East countries will find their own way to achieve these goals, but looks to provide advice and support drawing on the UK’s long-history and experience in these areas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fellows already hold senior positions in their governments or are active in business, law, journalism and civil society. This project helps them develop their own project ideas during their stay in London as well as supporting the implementation of these on their return home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s cadre include Rakan Madi and Wafa’ Nimri.  Rakan is working to energise the relationship between Jordanian voters and their elected representatives. He said the JSMT programme had given him “a great chance to shadow a member of parliament” and find out more about MPs’ responsibilities.  Wafa’ Nimri’s project seeks to counter misinformation in Jordan.  She  said her “experience with the John Smith Memorial Trust showcased  the rule of law and good governance in a system where collaborative ideas flourish and people are questioned and held to account. I loved it, it’s hands-on and spot-on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Support for a global Arms Trade Treaty</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday UN Member States voted overwhelmingly in support of a UN General Assembly Resolution that secured a resumption of negotiations on the Arms Trade Treaty. The Resolution convened a further UN conference from 18 to 28 March 2013 in New York. Speaking today, Minister responsible for the Arms Trade Treaty, Alistair Burt said:            &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yesterday in New York, 157 countries pledged their support for a global Arms Trade Treaty. An overwhelming majority of states, including the US, China and India, voted for a return to UN negotiations in 2013 to finalise work on a Treaty that will save lives, reduce human suffering and bring consistency to the global trade in conventional arms. The UK has led the international efforts towards an Arms Trade Treaty since 2006 and, with the majority of the world alongside us, will redouble our efforts to secure a Treaty that will make a difference to millions of lives around the world. Agreement on an Arms Trade Treaty is closer than ever, and the UK will be at the forefront of efforts to finally secure this. I appreciate the public support which has underlined our approach and helped to secure this positive outcome.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;“I condemn yesterday’s provocative decision to advance settlement construction in East Jerusalem and the West Bank through the publication of tenders for 1285 settlement housing units. The UK has been consistently clear that Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and by altering the situation on the ground are making the two state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital, increasingly hard to realise. It is deeply disappointing that the Government of Israel continues to ignore the appeals of the UK and other friends of Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>The Arab Partnership</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, how nice to see everybody here to celebrate where we are to date with the Arab Partnership and to see so many friends from around the region; Excellencies, colleagues and friends to celebrate with us and I’m delighted to be joined by Alan [Duncan] as  part of it and of course you’ve got the very special speaker [Nesryn Bouziane] in between who speaks with even greater authority than, than Ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to say that we feel as Ministers we have the privilege of calling many people in this room partners, those from international and local civil society organisations, think tanks, the media, the private sector as well as colleagues from an array of British Government departments. We’re here because the work we’re doing through the Arab Partnership and Conflict Pool is of vital importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arab Spring is the beginning of unprecedented change in the Middle East and North African region towards the more open and accountable societies its people so emphatically demand. It’s also of great importance to the United Kingdom. Our security and prosperity on this island are closely linked to the region’s long-term stability but we have never thought that this long-term stability would appear overnight. I don’t agree with those who say the Arab Spring has become a winter. There are challenges: the economic troubles facing some countries in the region, the terrible ongoing violence in Syria - these must be overcome but they’re not the destination of the Arab Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Egypt under the former President Mubarak could any of us have conceived of a President elected democratically by popular consent? Could we have imagined, just a short time ago the political debate now common in Tunisia under the former President? And without the Arab Spring would Morocco be in the position of having a Prime Minister selected by Parliament? The answer to each of these questions is of course no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must take heart in these achievements, not minimise them, but remember that strong institutions like an independent judiciary, a vibrant civil society are the building blocks of democracy. They take generations to build and require constant vigilance to maintain. We must have the strategic patience to partner with the region over the long term to build the institutions needed for the long term stability that will benefit us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, we’ve stood by reformers in the region from the outset. Two years ago this week, before the Arab Spring began, we established the Arab Human Development Team, now the Arab Partnership Department, to analyse the drivers of discontent in the region. With this analysis in hand in Kuwait in January 2011 our Prime Minister, David Cameron, stepped out ahead of the international community. He pledged to support reformers as they led the momentous changes in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can be rightly proud that his blueprint for engagement with the region based on our values and our interests, coupled with the sensitivity to the unique context of each country in the region, has been adopted by leaders worldwide. A clear sign of United Kingdom influencing is in multilateral fora such as the G8 and EU and Alan [Duncan] will speak a little further about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011 we committed to add to the United Kingdom Government funds already being spent on conflict prevention in the region, a further one hundred and ten million pounds of Arab Partnership funding over four years to support political and economic reform. I don’t need to make claims about the success of our interventions so far, our partners in the region are already telling us this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leading Tunisian newspaper described an Arab Partnership funded project encouraging political debate on Tunisian TV as, I quote, “a possible solution to save a media that was worn out by dictatorship”. An officer in the Lebanese Army paid tribute to training provided through the Conflict Pool for helping save civilian lives and reducing casualties in recent flash points. And, the Moroccan Minister for Youth and Sports described, unprompted, the Arab Partnership as a wonderful opportunity for Arab youth to voice their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s celebrate success but let’s also prepare for the work there is still to do. Our support cannot and will not stand still. In July, I visited an ongoing Arab Partnership funded project training producers and journalists of Algerian TV, and as we speak BBC veteran, Tim Sebastian, is hosting a televised debate in Cairo on the progress of democracy in Egypt as part of the new Arab debates’ series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples. Around the room there are those who can speak of many more. We have colleagues from Parliament who are engaged in this work. I see many Ambassadors from the countries with whom we have a close relationship who have been keen partners in this project, who emphasise the way in which this is tailor made to the needs of their own states because that is what we are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am confident that those in the Department and those we partner with have that sensitivity in mind. We hope this will be a further opportunity for continuing progress in the time to come. We’re confident about the building blocks we’ve laid but most of all I’m confident about all the people we work with, their commitment to a region we all love so much, and to a future in which I’m sure so many of us have a perfect stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
