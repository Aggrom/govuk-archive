    <title>Consultation launched on the future of Britain's Reserve Forces</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation, ‘Future Reserves 2020: Delivering the Nation’s Security Together’, proposes more training for reservists, a ‘kitemark-type’ award for supportive employers, and the idea of changing the Territorial Army’s name to reflect their enhanced role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the proposals there will be a new relationship between reservists, employers and government, and a transparent approach whereby employers are given more certainty about the timing of possible mobilisations and more notice when they occur. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures will create a fully integrated force of regulars and reservists, using similar equipment and training together. It will mean that the Reserves not only provide individual augmentees to regular units, but also deploy as formed units and sub-units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Members of the Royal Marines Reserve" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1435/Consultation_launched_on_the_future_of_Britain_s_Reserve_Forces2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Members of the Royal Marines Reserve received a rare opportunity to form the Guard at Edinburgh Castle recently
[Picture: Leading Airman (Photographer) Will Haigh, Crown Copyright/MOD 2012]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of trained Reserves will grow to around 35,000 across all three Services by 2020, aligning the mix of regular and reserve components with many of our closest allies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army will see the biggest change, with 30,000 trained Reserves, creating a total land force of about 120,000. And the plans are backed by an extra £1.8bn in funding over the next ten years for new equipment, uniforms and training for the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will also look at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• increasing the number of days Army reservists are required to train from 35 to 40 days a year  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• a change of name from Territorial Army to Army Reserve - better reflecting the future role and tasks  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• encouraging more ex-regulars to become reservists - making it easier for them to transfer to the Reserves and developing incentives for them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Secretary said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This transformation of the Reserves will see a radical shift in the way in which we use them, with units deployed as formed units or sub-units as well as delivering individual augmentees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Increased training, better equipment and extra investment in our Reserves are all integral to our vision of a formidable, adaptable and flexible Armed Forces, with a reserve/regular balance more in line with our main allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Government has committed £1.8bn to rebuilding our Reserves. The consultation I have launched today is about working with reservists, their families and employers to use that money to design the Reserve Forces of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Houghton, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since 2003 there have been over 25,000 reservists mobilised, fighting alongside their regular counterparts. 29 have paid the ultimate price for their country and just this summer we saw 2,000 reservists provide a pivotal security role at the London 2012 Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the future we will become even more reliant on our Reserves. But this increased reliance means that there are key issues that we have to tackle - like our relationship with employers and the notice period ahead of mobilisation - to get this right. I want to encourage everyone to get involved in this consultation and have their say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation will run until 18 January 2013 and following this we will publish a White Paper in Spring 2013 setting out this new relationship.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Work on Afghan officers' academy underway as HERRICK 17 begins</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building of the future &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Army Officer Academy"&gt;ANAOA&lt;/abbr&gt;, marked today, 10 October, by an earth-turning ceremony at its site in the Afghan capital, underlines the UK’s long-term commitment to a secure Afghanistan after combat operations cease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once fully operational, the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Army Officer Academy"&gt;ANAOA&lt;/abbr&gt; will train up to 1,350 male students and 150 female students each year. Based on a model resembling the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, it will help to sustain the ongoing progress being made in building a capable and professional Afghan National Army. This work will take place during and after the transition of security responsibilities to the Afghan Government post-2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event coincided with the transfer of authority between British brigades in Helmand with 4th Mechanized Brigade taking command of Task Force Helmand from 12th Mechanized Brigade which is now on its way home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image embedded"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Brigadier Doug Chalmers (left), Commander of 12th Mechanized Brigade, and Brigadier Bob Bruce of 4th Mechanized Brigade " src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/1479/Work_on_Afghan_officers__academy_underway_as_HERRICK_17_begins2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next six months will see 4th Mechanized Brigade working in support of the Afghan National Security Forces to ensure they are capable of assuming full security responsibilities by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In July, the [UK] Prime Minister [David Cameron] and President Karzai signed a Memorandum of Understanding to reaffirm UK and Afghan dedication to the officer academy project in Kabul which is one of the UK’s commitments to an enduring partnership with Afghanistan after our combat operations cease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The academy will present a real opportunity for us to help generate a well-trained cadre of junior officers to bolster the leadership within the Afghan Army for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Both the commencement of the &lt;abbr title="Afghan National Army Officer Academy"&gt;ANAOA&lt;/abbr&gt; project and the planned drawdown of 500 personnel from 4th Mechanized Brigade by the end of the year demonstrate significant steps forward in a transition process that is well on track and will see us hand over full security responsibility for Afghanistan to its own security forces in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the earth-turning ceremony in Kabul, Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Lieutenant General Adrian Bradshaw, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The training that will take place here will develop the next generation of military leaders in a brand new Afghan National Army Officer Academy. This is yet another example of how ISAF and the Afghan National Security Forces are sustaining the progress we have made in building a capable and professional force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am very proud of our achievements and the turning of the earth marks not only the start of the main construction effort but also the beginning of the academy itself. It is a truly historic occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personnel from 4th Mechanized Brigade will work alongside the Afghan Army and the Afghan National Police in a co-ordinated effort over the forthcoming winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigadier Bob Bruce, Commander of Task Force Helmand for HERRICK 17, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our focus throughout this deployment will be on assisting our Afghan allies to deliver security to their people. We are superbly well trained and equipped to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Real success has been achieved. As the Afghan security forces continue to grow in capability and confidence we will reduce our profile. I am planning to send 500 troops home by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/05/14 - Address to the 3rd Annual Electrical Infrastructure Security Summit</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a great pleasure to be here today at the 3rd annual EISS summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am extremely grateful to James [ARBUTHNOT], not just for his work as Chair of the Defence Select Committee, but for the efforts he makes personally to ensure attention in the UK is focussed on the threats it needs to be focussed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can take personal credit for opening my eyes to the problems we face in protecting the critical electrical systems and our critical networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most positive aspects of this annual event is that it brings together people from very different professional backgrounds, with different skill-sets and different expertise - but who share a common interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together to make sure threats to our infrastructure, whether from natural or man-made sources, are investigated, assessed, monitored and indeed mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists and security analysts; energy experts and astronomers; the public and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a multi-disciplinary problem, so it means all of us working together across traditional boundaries, including across government departments - sometimes the most difficult bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is a global problem, so it means countries working together across international borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to give a particular welcome to the representatives from around the world who are gathered here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand representatives from 20 countries are here today, working together to address a complex set of problems, demanding a complex set of responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of the intricate web of threats we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-layered, asymmetrical, unconventional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often requiring a defence and security response that is not based on traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That cannot be met using infantry, or jet planes or destroyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of the big challenges we face as politicians, particularly at a time of limited resources, is to make the case for spending on defence and security solutions that cannot readily be seen by the taxpaying public who are financing this - that cannot be shown off on the parade ground - that sometimes cannot be talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk today about the progress the UK Government has made, since the EISS summit in Washington last year, in strengthening resilience in the face of specific threats to electrical networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Secretary of State for Defence, I have a particular concern to ensure that we deter and prevent any prospect of a large-scale malicious attack and that the UK’s Armed Forces have the ability to respond to such an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me first talk about the profile of the threat, because in an era of fiscal challenge, limited resources must be deployed with pin-point accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That needs a deep understanding of the risks and the discipline to tailor our response rigorously and proportionately to those risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scattergun is not an affordable weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vulnerability"&gt;VULNERABILITY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the developed world, our connected, high-technology societies are massively reliant on electronic networks, and becoming ever more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, electronic technology reaches into every part of government, every business, every home, and increasingly, with mobile and wi-fi technology, pretty much every pocket in the country. Dependence creates vulnerability, and connectivity compounds that vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take away the technology and our modern life-support system falters - it’s not just light and heat - it’s the digital computers and automated systems that help run many things we rely on - from health care to the transport system, from ATMs and EPOS terminals to the food distribution network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sustained black-out covering a large geographical area could have crippling consequences and do serious damage to the welfare of our citizens, as well as the functioning of our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the resilience of the systems that help run our society is a concern of our domestic civil contingencies organisation, and assessing the risks to those systems is a matter of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, we take a holistic approach to risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working through the National Security Council, with its multi-disciplinary cross-government approach, we ensure or try to ensure that all avenues are explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest National Risk Register for Civil Emergencies was published in January and the update of the National Security Risk Assessment, last undertaken as part of the 2010 National Security Strategy, will be completed later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have a robust foundation upon which our plans are laid and resource allocation decisions are made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of today, I want to address two risks to our electrical infrastructure that I know are of concern, and which formed the basis of a recent House of Commons Defence Select Committee Report, and set out how we are acting to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is man-made and hostile: the employment of a nuclear weapon to generate a high-altitude electro-magnetic pulse, or HEMP, taking out electrical and digital systems over possibly thousands of square miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A threat in which I, as Defence Secretary, have an obvious and specific interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is natural and impossible to prevent: a severe electro-magnetic storm caused by solar activity that has the capacity to cause significant disturbance to communication and power systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="high-altitude-electro-magnetic-pulse"&gt;HIGH-ALTITUDE ELECTRO MAGNETIC PULSE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me deal first with the issue of a HEMP attack using a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me be crystal clear:  A HEMP attack using a nuclear weapon against, or affecting, the United Kingdom, or our vital interests, or those of our allies, would be considered a nuclear attack on the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences for the perpetrator of a nuclear weapon being used as a HEMP device would therefore be severe and any potential aggressor should be aware that we will respond proportionately against any state that launches or enables such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s nuclear weapons are an important element of our capability so to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, although we must remain alert to the risk, we judge the likelihood of a HEMP attack against our homeland to be low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would require a combination of warhead and missile capabilities that is restricted at present to a few states, none of whom, we judge, currently have the intent to conduct a HEMP attack, and all of whom would understand the severe consequences of such aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not expect that development of a HEMP capability would be a priority for a non-state actor when weighed against the other options they may have the capacity to achieve - such as a dirty bomb or other asymmetric methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK focus is therefore aimed at preventing a HEMP threat becoming imminent and immediate - through deterrence, counter-proliferation and multi-lateral disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also work to better understand and promote awareness of the threat, including internationally, supporting the International Electrotechnical Commission’s work on HEMP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we cannot discount the risk that a nuclear-based HEMP threat to our vital interests will not emerge by 2050, which is our planning horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while large nuclear arsenals and the possibility of proliferation exist, nuclear deterrence at a minimum effective level, will remain an important element in our national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no complacency and the significant resources we are investing in the UK maintaining and, in 2020s, renewing Trident are testament to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the low likelihood of a HEMP threat arising means that extra resources may be better directed towards threats, for example, in the cyber domain, where an attack against our electronic arteries would be deniable, cheaper, have a more certain effect and therefore be more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is just what the Government is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the UK considers a nuclear HEMP attack to be of low likelihood, we consider there is the significant possibility of a space weather event over the next 5 years that has the potential to cause disruption to the United Kingdom’s electrical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="space-weather"&gt;SPACE WEATHER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With cyclical solar activity set to peak next year we should prepare for the possibility of some level of disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is when and how much, not if.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low level disruption due to solar activity is of course a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is how we prepare for an event of sufficient magnitude that widespread damage is caused to satellite systems or electrical circuits, leading to the sustained interruption of power or communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to have in place monitoring systems and predictive models that deliver sufficient warning of severe events to enable us to take preventative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we need to have a far better understanding of the vulnerabilities in our networks, better to deploy our mitigation effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will enable systems to be hardened only where they need to be and for resources to be used wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focussing on the most critical systems we can minimise the cost and maximise the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a world class scientific base, and so we are well positioned to contribute to the collaborative efforts taking place internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Antarctic Survey has a leading role in the EU space weather forecasting project for satellite operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Geological Society is working with European partners to assess the threat posed by magnetic storms to power distribution networks in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing partnership between the UK Met Office and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is particularly encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Met Office and NOAA last year has paved the way for the creation of a space weather model capable of indicating where, when, and for how long, space weather effects will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Summit can of course contribute greatly to the understanding of the issues we face in common and help to focus the work that is on-going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, government departments have been working extensively with space weather scientists and engineers, industry and regulators to gain the best available quantitative assessment of the risk to UK infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a broad and diverse programme of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has worked with external experts to review the National Risk Assessment to make sure new and emerging risks are detected and the understanding of current risks is right up to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Energy Emergencies Executive Committee keeps contingency plans up to date and has provided the National Grid and the Department of Energy &amp;amp; Climate Change with a solid body of work to help analyse the impacts of space weather events and build predictive models that will improve contingency planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supergrid transformer design requirements have changed as a result, and strategic reserve holdings of transformers are being increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Grid is working with the British Geological Survey to make sure there is robust real-time network monitoring in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Space Security Policy is due to be published later in the year and will look at all these risks in a much wider context, to make sure all parts of Government are working effectively together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of Britain’s military equipment is designed to work in challenging electro-magnetic environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shielding developed in this context - against interference, discovery or detection for example - can provide some protection against electro-magnetic effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical military infrastructure can, of course, operate independently of the national grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory has a great deal of expertise in working with industry hardening and assessing electronic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want the MOD to contribute actively to the improvement of the UK’s civil infrastructure resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is quite a lot of information on EMP protection from the Government and others that is already in the public domain, for example that published by the International Electrotechnical Commission, and the MOD itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD will now explore with others in Government whether there is more that we can share with civilian infrastructure providers, including, for example, sensitive elements of the Defence Standards on EMP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, we have to change the way people think about Defence and Security. This is a challenge for us all. It is about recognising the new dependencies and vulnerabilities that flow from the way people now live their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is about recognising that the solutions may require committing resources to defences you can’t see or hear or touch.  And persuading our taxpayers that it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting the hi-tech networks that power our global society is part of this new way of thinking - and new way of acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicting and monitoring; preparing and mitigating; nationally and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing risk and responding proportionately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that today is another step forward in helping us banish any lingering complacency and that we can continue to work together to ensure that the dependence on electrical networks and digital control systems that has so enhanced our quality of life and standard of living, does not become our Achilles heel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/05/02 - Shared Security: Transforming Defence to Face the Future</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great pleasure to be here in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A city I first visited some 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one which I got to know well in the 70’s and 80’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Berlin I knew then was - of course - a completely different city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s wonderful to see the modern, vibrant, reunited city of today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with reunification of the city, many of the old certainties and familiar features have gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is a metaphor for the wider changes that have taken place in the 20 years since the Wall came down - not just in Germany, or in Europe, but across the globe - and in the strategic security environment in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War imposed order and a degree of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brutal order, but order nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world was divided; Europe was divided; this city was divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, at least the dividing lines were clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enemy was known and was pretty predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In divided Europe, NATO and the Warsaw Pact understood the boundries and operated by a set of rules and understandings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox of the 70s and 80s, particularly in contrast to what has followed, is that while the West still faced, in theory at least, an existential threat, the stand off with the Soviet Union had become ritualised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there was always the scope for miscalculation, it had become, in Europe at least, a more or less stable balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that balance, on one side, was based on an unjust and unsustainable repression which ultimately undid it from within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in pure power-balance terms, we have swapped the certainty of a known and predictable enemy, posing an existential threat, but held effectively in check; a world in which all actors were clients of one side or the other; for a world of shifting power balances, emerging, independent challengers and diverse non-state threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that even as that existential challenge wanes, a myriad of lesser, but none-the-less potentially devastating threats emerge to make our societies in some ways less safe, less secure, and less certain in facing the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="facing-the-future"&gt;FACING THE FUTURE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unpredictability and rapid change in the threat picture we face makes it all the more important that our respective Armed Forces, and our collective defence arrangements, are correctly configured to meet the requirements of today - and prepared, at the same time, for what is around the next corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what I want to talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How our nations - Germany and Britain - two of the world’s largest economies, despite the immediate the economic difficulties we face - how we are responding to the security challenges that now confront us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why we have both embarked on an ambitious and essential transformation of our respective Armed Forces and Defence postures, not just to meet our own national security requirements, but also to meet the responsibilities we have to our allies - and more widely, to international security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My central argument is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of European nations to defend their citizens can no longer be discharged by a strategy of homeland defence and a Fortress Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threats we face are no longer territorial, so a passive defence of national territory is no longer adequate protection for our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our security requires that we do not sit back and let threats come to us - but that we project power to meet them - wherever in the world they are forming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we need to take that final step up from the defensive posture of the Cold War, to respond to a future in which threats can originate thousands of miles away, yet can be swiftly felt at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better to prevent, contain, and tackle threats at distance, than to confront their consequences on our own streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the NATO Alliance, and the European part of it in particular, must continue to develop together the capability and the political will to act when necessary - to project power, including, but not limited to, military power, and to deploy it rapidly when we must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must do this together because no country, not even the United States, can hope to tackle successfully all the threats we face in common, by acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about European nations being producers of security, not merely consumers of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading from the front in our own region - and taking responsibility for what happens in our backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing up to the future - not living in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it has become clear over this last year, particularly following the operation in Libya, just how urgent the need for transformation has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-need-for-transformation"&gt;THE NEED FOR TRANSFORMATION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation Unified Protector was a coalition success, and for the people of Libya, a liberation they can justly claim to have seen through themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has reconfirmed the utility of NATO as the most successful tool for collective defence ever created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sustained multinational action was required by the United Nations, NATO was the only effective available coordinating mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Libya operation also cruelly exposed the imbalances and weaknesses in the Alliance and thus the scale of the task facing European NATO nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the very limited nature of the Libyan campaign, the nations of Europe could not have undertaken this operation without the US shouldering much of the weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should have come as no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what the problems are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many allies are failing to meet their financial responsibilities to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many countries are failing to build and maintain appropriate capabilities to meet the new threats we face, or to make them available for operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have known about these deficiencies for many years, and we have fretted earnestly about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time we cannot afford to brush them under the carpet and carry on as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the United States has made clear, that it intends to reflect in its strategic posture, the growing importance of the developing challenges in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear about this - it is in Europe’s interest that the United States rises to the challenge that the emergence of China as a global power presents and we should support the decisions the US has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that means we, the nations of Europe, must take on more responsibility for our own back yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shouldering the major burden in the Balkans and the Mediterranean, but also being prepared, if necessary to take a bigger role in relation to North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about the United States walking away; this is about the nations of Europe taking more of the strain of our collective defence in our own region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the threats that most directly impact on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fiscal-realities"&gt;FISCAL REALITIES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the need for transformation in our collective defence capabilities has now become urgent, so too are the fiscal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debt crisis should be considered one of the greatest strategic threats to the future security of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic integrity is the well-spring of strategic strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, surely, is one of the primary lessons of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet economic system could not sustain the investment in Defence required to match NATO’s power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military power and economic power are inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without strong economies and sound public finances, it will be impossible to sustain in the long term, the military capability required across Europe to maintain collective defence and, when necessary, project power to confront threats as they form abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am a realist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the reality is that, across the alliance, aggregate defence expenditure is certain to fall in the short term and, at best, recover slowly in the medium term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, in the long run, all NATO members, if they benefit from collective defence, must contribute appropriately to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of us must live up to the responsibility to fund national Defence properly as a contribution to the Alliance - a responsibility which we reconfirmed as recently as 2010 at the Lisbon Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the short term - when pressures on national budgets are so severe - it is frankly a waste of breath to call for more Defence Spending to bridge the gap between what the Alliance needs and what the Alliance has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for now, more money is not going to be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problem remains; and if we can’t spend more, we must do things differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximising the capability we can squeeze out of the resources we have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritising ruthlessly; specialising aggressively and collaborating unsentimentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in capability that is fully deployable, and available for collective defence action - if necessary, outside Europe’s borders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together to do more, with less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="collective-defence"&gt;COLLECTIVE DEFENCE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s National Security Strategy and Germany’s Defence Policy Guidelines come to the same conclusion: to tackle the threats we share in common, we need to act in common - through all the institutions that exist to provide us with a collective response - the UN, NATO, and the EU among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being a realist, I am a pragmatist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters is what works - and what is affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to produce extra military effect, and do it swiftly, without duplicating effort or reinventing proven structures that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because institution-building consumes resources that are in short supply and deflects energies better spent making the current architecture work more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why, as it is for Germany, NATO is ‘the centre-piece’ of Britain’s collective defence efforts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, again as it is for Germany, making NATO’s Smart Defence initiative a success is our priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Summit is our opportunity to define more sharply what we intend to do to make it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To look beyond a limited set of short-term equipment projects, to a new way of thinking on Alliance-wide capability planning and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will need to begin with a clear-sighted assessment of the current state of NATO’s collective competence, taking account of what we know of reductions already planned and how these will impact on current capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a willingness to recognise the gap between that capability and NATO’s stated level of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will provide a baseline against which to take the right decisions: greater pooling and sharing of capabilities; mission, role and geographic specialisation; greater sharing of technology; co-operation on logistics; and more collaborative training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="multi-layered-defence"&gt;MULTI-LAYERED DEFENCE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Britain, Smart Defence is also about making the Alliance more flexible, encouraging collaboration among groups of Allies and with partners outside the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Libya and Afghanistan have shown how agile NATO can be in incorporating the contributions of outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should capitalise on this experience in making it easier for non-NATO nations and key potential partners to contribute to NATO’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an approach that allows natural bi-lateral partnerships or regional groupings within the Alliance and across its boundaries, to flourish - adding value to the capabilities available to the Alliance as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain is actively pursuing such collaborative initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Northern Group of nations, which includes Germany, the Baltic and Nordic countries (including Sweden), Poland and the Netherlands, as well as the UK, is part of this process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Franco-British Defence Treaties, signed last year, herald another deepening partnership for the United Kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
A model for bi-lateral co-operation that allows the production of greater capability between nations of similar ambition and similar approach to the generation and deployment of armed force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Franco-British relationship is not exclusive. It is structured around the areas where Britain and France can most effectively and logically co-operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="britain-and-germany"&gt;BRITAIN AND GERMANY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the United Kingdom would welcome an enhanced defence and security relationship with Germany. Based on the areas where we can best add to Alliance Capability through bi-lateral co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new and stronger defence relationship, based on the challenges we will face in common in the future, not those that we shared in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relationship that delivers practical benefits and enhances our mutual security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on  the structured dialogue that currently exists to produce concrete results based on the guiding principles we have set out together, focussed on support to operations and force deployability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should work towards common positions in NATO and the EU; identifying reasons for any disagreements and tackling them head on, while building on the many areas or agreement as a foundation of our future co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="capability--deployability"&gt;CAPABILITY &amp;amp; DEPLOYABILITY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, we have had to make some tough decisions to tackle a Defence programme that was over-heated and unrealistic, as well a fiscal deficit that was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Armed Forces that will emerge from our Defence Review will be formidable, flexible and adaptable - equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world, supported by the fourth largest Defence budget in the world, meeting in full our NATO responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will be smaller, but more relevant to addressing the real threats to our national and collective security, and still one of the world’s most capable fighting forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the process, the watchword has been capability not size - capability that can be deployed swiftly within a force posture that is inherently adaptable and configured to tackle a wide range of different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus on capability rather than size is one of the most positive outcomes, I believe, that is emerging from the German transformation programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, a posture of homeland defence, with a large citizen army, was the right response to the conditions Germany faced at that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the decision to end conscription and move to an all volunteer force is the right response to the conditions that Germany faces now, recognising that across Europe, we cannot afford a surplus of high-cost manpower, when the deficit is in deployability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new phase, and a significant step forward in Germany’s post-cold war reconfiguration to face the future Symbolised by the commitment made to the mission in Afghanistan..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the third largest contributor, the Bundeswehr is working alongside, and sharing the risks with, 49 other nations, including Britain, to ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for the international terrorism and radicalisation which is the most immediate threat we all face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both Britain and Germany, the test of transformation will be the ability to generate the level of military capability set out in our plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it will also rely, in Germany in particular, on the ability to generate the political will and public support for the deployment of military resources more widely in the future in support of Alliance operations beyond our borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By re-focussing existing budgetary resources on more deployable capabilities, Germany has probably a greater capacity than any other European NATO partner to contribute to short-term enhancement of the Alliance’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in all our interests to encourage Germany to realise that potential. I agree with Minister de Maiziere that the posture of the cold war- preparing to meet threats as they come to us - cannot deliver the security Germany needs in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the US, rightly, turning to focus more of it’s attention on the pacific, we Europeans need now to step up to the plate to deliver security in our own neighbourhood, but also to project power to meet threats to our citizens as they arise abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, we need to see all NATO partners meeting their financial commitments to defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the short-term, with no additional resources realistically available, we have no choice but to do things differently; focussing relentlessly on the production of deployable capability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And developing the political will within our Nations, to allow the projection of power, including military force, to confront threats to our security, wherever they arise, and whatever form they take. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a European contribution to collective defence that effectively responds to the challenge articulated by Secretaries Gates and Pannetta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in so doing, strengthening NATO as our vehicle of choice for multi-lateral military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maintaining the transatlantic link which is the ultimate guarantee of our security, even as we resolve to do more for ourselves in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/04/26 - Afghanistan Statement</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, with your permission I would like to make a statement on future UK force levels in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by paying tribute to the commitment, professionalism and bravery of the men and women of the United Kingdom’s Armed Forces deployed in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since UK forces first deployed to Afghanistan in 2001, over 100,000 personnel have served on operations there, many for more than one tour, and many more, military and civilian, have supported the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the surge in the international commitment to the mission as a whole in 2009, which boosted the forces available to ISAF by 30,000, the United Kingdom has maintained an enduring level of conventional forces  in Afghanistan of 9,500, the great majority of whom are now in the UK area of operations in Central Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a critical period for the mission, for UK Forces, for ISAF and, significantly, for the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our combined efforts have arrested the momentum of the insurgency, diminished its capability, and weakened its strategic position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it still represents a threat to the people of Afghanistan and to the security of Afghan territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It retains the ability to launch significant operations, as the attack on Kabul on April 15th and 16th demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response of the ANSF to that attack demonstrated just how far they have come in terms of their capability and their ability to undertake major operations autonomously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are justifiably proud of their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our aim in Afghanistan is to build Afghan governance and security forces to the point where they are resilient in the face of any residual threat from the insurgency, are confident in their ability to protect their own citizens and able to deny safe haven to terrorists who seek to use Afghan territory as a base from which to threaten international security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant progress is being made across Afghanistan and the Monthly Progress Report for March, published today by the FCO, DfID and MOD sets out more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is that progress more obvious than in Helmand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now 12 District Governors in Helmand’s 14 districts, up from just 5 in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 extra schools have opened since 2010 with another 46 currently being built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29 extra health clinics open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More roads; more bridges; bazaars re-opening, meaning more commerce and opportunities for ordinary Helmandis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year alone, income levels in Helmand have increased by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosperity will be a critical weapon in the battle against the insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this social and economic progress has been made possible by the improvements in security across the province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been facilitated not just by the surge in ISAF troops, but by the increasing number and quality of Afghan National Security Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the Afghan National Army in Regional Command (South West), which includes Helmand Province, has increased by 30% in the last 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the three districts in Task Force Helmand’s area of operations have now entered formal transition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security situation in these districts is unrecognisable compared with the start of British operations in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole of Lashkar Gah District and the most populous 60% of Nad-e Ali is now completely under Afghan control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ANSF has demonstrated repeatedly its ability to provide security in these areas and, as a result, 36 of Task Force Helmand’s checkpoints, patrol bases and military positions have been handed over to the ANSF in the last 6 months, while a further 16 new posts have been constructed and occupied by Afghan Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has enabled Task Force Helmand to reduce its basing footprint by 50% and, as circumstances allow, UK and ISAF forces are progressively moving towards the support role of training, advising and assisting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 20 Armoured Brigade’s recent tour, the campaign moved to being run on an Afghan formulated campaign plan - written in Dari by the Afghans and executed by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven major operations were carried out over the six month period of Herrick 15 - a pace that in the words of the UK Brigade Commander, “sometimes left us running to catch up with our Afghan colleagues”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent Operation Now Roz over 1,000 members of the ANSF, supported by British forces, cleared insurgents from a key heartland within the Helmand river valley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While UK Forces secured the flanks, the Afghans cleared more than 200 compounds, made safe 44 IEDs, found seven bomb-making factories and confiscated over 145 kilograms of homemade explosives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth major ANA operation in Central Helmand in four months and the largest and most complex so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of that operation further demonstrated the ANSF’s increasing professionalism and capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Speaker, Helmand remains difficult and challenging and the insurgency remains a constant threat, but the progress we have made demonstrates that we are on target to meet the transition objectives agreed by President Karzai and the international community at Lisbon in November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining that momentum will be the challenge of the transition process between now and the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no room at all for complacency and much work needs to be done to maintain the momentum of progress in building ANSF capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the reality on the ground is that Afghan forces are increasingly taking the lead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows ISAF, including UK Forces, to gradually reduce force levels and to change their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister announced in July last year that we would be drawing down UK forces by 500 to 9,000 by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the Defence Staff has now provided military advice on how these reductions will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The House will understand that it is not appropriate go into exact operational details or to talk about specific capabilities, but I am able to give the House a general overview of how the manpower reductions will be achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I can confirm that, reflecting the reduction in the need for ISAF ground holding capabilities as transition progresses and the Afghans take over positions, the majority of the 500 being withdrawn will be combat troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we will merge the UK Forces Headquarters in Nahr-e Saraj North and Nahr-e Saraj South to better align with the increasingly important Afghan administrative boundaries and the civilian control structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will deliver us efficiencies and manpower savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there will be a reduction in support personnel and enablers commensurate with the changes I have set out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will withdraw some combat support capabilities for which there is no longer an operational need as a result of the availability of alternative weapons systems in theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These measures will reduce the United Kingdom’s enduring conventional force levels to 9,000 and will be completed by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also inform the House that, in addition to the overall reduction in numbers, a further 200 combat troops will be transferred from a ground holding role to Security Force Assistance teams working with the ANSF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For avoidance of doubt, I should be clear that, whatever role is being fulfilled, including the training of ANSF forces, British forces in Afghanistan will retain combat capability until the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Speaker, The details I have announced today are consistent with our intention to move out of a combat role by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They demonstrate our commitment to the process of transition, and the increasing capacity and capability of the ANSF, reflecting their real achievements on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they grow, and gradually take lead responsibility for security across the country, ISAF’s military footprint will reduce further, including that of the United Kingdom, and we will keep the House informed of future plans for further reductions in UK troop numbers as conditions on the ground permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our combat role will end by December 2014, but the United Kingdom’s commitment to Afghanistan is for the long-term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is demonstrated in part by the announcement I made last week at the NATO ministerial meeting that we will commit £70m per year to the future funding of the ANSF after 2014, and by our commitment to run the Afghan National Army Officer Training Academy which we are currently building outside Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each nation has its own constitutional processes in which to consider its contribution as transition moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all agree that ISAF cohesion must be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK will continue to work and plan closely with our ISAF partners, particularly those operating alongside us in Helmand, including the United States, who provide the bulk of coalition forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Prime Minister told the House yesterday “The speed of the reductions between now and the end of 2014 will be in accordance with the conditions on the ground and with what is right in terms of transitioning from allied control to Afghan control–and at all times, of course, paramount in our minds is the safety and security of our brave armed forces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That safety and security will be best assured by working with our allies in a co-ordinated drawdown as responsibilities are handed progressively to the ANSF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the way to honour and protect the legacy of our involvement in Afghanistan, and of the sacrifice made by the 409 servicemen and women who have given their lives, and the hundreds who have suffered life-changing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commend this statement to the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/01/05 - NATO: The Case for Collective Defence in the 21st Century</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let me begin by thanking Brent Scowcroft for his words of introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an honour to be introduced by someone with such a record of service to this country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that Gen Scowcroft has recently highlighted the importance of taking care of the transatlantic relationship as we go through difficult times - that is very much the focus of my speech today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the announcement of a $500bn budget cut doesn’t count as difficult times, I don’t know what does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventy years ago this month, in January 1942, Winston Churchill was in the United States for the Arcadia Conference; the Conference that set the strategy for the Allied victory in the Second World War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The despatch of US Army, Navy, and Air Forces to Britain was imminent; marking the second time in a century the United States had come to the aid of the democratic nations of Europe in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it wouldn’t be the last time - by the end of the decade, this trans-Atlantic alliance would be formalised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - NATO - the most powerful military alliance ever to exist - its primary mission to defend its members against a new threat to the free world - the threat of Soviet Communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, here at the Atlantic Council, now 50 years old and formed to promote trans-Atlantic co-operation, I want to talk about the future of NATO, why it remains important, and how it can respond to the budget pressures that all its members are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-north-atlantic-alliance"&gt;THE NORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three central arguments I want to make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - that collective defence is the only practical response to the world we live in; a world in which the unpredictable and diverse threats we face cannot be dealt with by any single country acting alone; and where the economic and fiscal challenges we face mean our only hope of sustaining relative defence capability is through effective collective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second - that however pressing the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region is to the United States, the alliance between the US and the countries of Europe is, and will remain, of vital interest to both continents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be times when our interests diverge, but they will be far outnumbered by the times when our interests are held in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that other regions are growing in power and influence is a reason to strengthen North Atlantic bonds rather than weaken them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third - that NATO is the best vehicle to advance our shared security agenda - it is established, proven, and based on shared values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as effective as NATO can be, Afghanistan and Libya have shown that the Alliance as a whole, and the contribution of some of its members, falls short of what our collective defence requires; in terms of capability, in terms of the balance of contribution, and in terms of the will to deploy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of economic austerity, fixing these problems will mean finding smarter ways of working together to get greater capability from the resources that exist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-anglo-american-relationship"&gt;THE ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before I make these arguments, as this is my first visit to the United States as Defence Secretary of the United Kingdom, I want to take a moment to reaffirm the special bonds that unite our two nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bonds of culture and history; the bonds of commerce and business and of a prosperity underpinned by free markets and competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds of friendship between our peoples; and bonds created by our shared values - freedom of speech and conscience; democracy and the rule of law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rule of law base on the Magna Carta, signed nearly 800 years ago at Runnymede in my own Parliamentary Constituency (and fittingly commemorated to this day by a memorial erected there by the American Bar Association);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Britain and the United States have strong and special relationships with other individual countries - with some of whom we share many of these common bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Anglo-American relationship remains unique - proven and time-honoured - particularly when it comes to our Defence relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Churchill who warned in his famous speech of 1946 in Fulton, Missouri that a fraternal association between our two nations would not be enough in the face of the challenges of the erupting Cold War - that together we needed to usher in a new type of defence relationship based on integration between our nations and with our allies of doctrine and weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My predecessor was a committed advocate of the Trans-Atlantic relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and I may be different in style, but on this issue (as on many others) we are at one on substance and I would not want to leave anyone in any doubt that my commitment to that relationship is equally strong and equally deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me set out why I believe we need to strengthen the bonds of our collective defence in this new era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="collective-defence"&gt;COLLECTIVE DEFENCE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In placing the North Atlantic Treaty before the Senate, back in April 1949, President Truman observed that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The security and welfare of each member of this community depends upon the security and welfare of all. None of us alone can achieve economic prosperity or military security. None of us alone can assure the continuance of freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was in 1949 - so it remains today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International terrorism, nuclear proliferation, failing states, resource depletion, the security consequences of a changing climate - this is a world of diverse and evolving threats - all of which have a global dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a globalised society there are no corners left to hide - hoping that bad things happen to someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, in this era of austerity, when budgets across the democratic world are being squeezed, none of us - not even the United States - can afford, in the long-term, the astronomical resource commitment required to deal with every threat from every source concurrently and with certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, collective defence is the only rational and long-term sustainable posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="shared-future"&gt;SHARED FUTURE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is about more than mutual defence - some “alliance of convenience”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is about an alliance of principles too; the mutual interest that comes from being democratic, open, trading powers who believe in freedom of speech and thought and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of dynamic capitalism in the Asia Pacific Region and in South America is creating movement in the tectonic plates as relative economic power shifts South and East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unsurprising that the mature economies of North America and Europe look beyond the North Atlantic area, and particularly into the Pacific, to ensure their prosperity - and indeed their national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if we nations of the North Atlantic Alliance find ourselves sometimes in economic competition, there is also a strong logic to our continued co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in all our interests that the emerging powers become responsible members of the international community - observing the norms of behaviour and international law that have been established over the past half century to provide stability to the global system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is in all our interests that the arteries of global trade are kept free, open and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our joint naval presence in the Arabian Gulf, something our regional partners very much appreciate, is key to keeping the Straits of Hormuz open for international trade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy will continue to play a substantial role as part of the Combined Maritime Forces, both at the Headquarters in Bahrain, and through our mine counter-measure vessels which help maintain freedom of navigation in the Gulf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption to the flow of oil through Straits of Hormuz would threaten regional and global economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt by Iran to close the Straits would be illegal and would be unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one very real and very current example of where US and European vital interests coincide outside the North Atlantic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminding us, yet again, why, as attention naturally drifts to the Asia-Pacific region - Europe and America have more reason to work together rather than less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are natural partners and NATO is a strong and durable expression of that partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like any relationship - that partnership must not be taken for granted. From time to time, it will need a little attention to deliver for all its members.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me turn to the challenge ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-challenge"&gt;THE CHALLENGE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful response of the Alliance to the crisis in Libya, has reconfirmed the utility of NATO, in delivering military force in a coalition, and serving the needs of international security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1973, who did they think would implement it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sustained multinational action was required, NATO was the only realistic coordinating mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO provides a ready structure for joint and combined operations which it is impossible to replicate quickly elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members can contribute to operations using existing protocols and structures; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other partners outside the Alliance can be swiftly and effectively accommodated, as both the Libya operations, and ISAF operations in Afghanistan show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why NATO remains the most powerful alliance in the world, and the most successful tool for collective defence ever invented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, Libya and Afghanistan have highlighted the significant difficulties we face in ensuring that NATO continues to serve the needs of collective security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of the past year, two US Defense Secretaries have felt the need to express their concern about the future of NATO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, each in their own way, has asked fundamental questions about the future of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the Alliance struggle to generate deployable capability from the huge forces nominally available to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we seeing the beginning of a two-tier alliance with some allies less willing to participate in operations than others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the $64,000 question: How long will public opinion in those nations who invest proportionally more in Defence capability be willing to subsidise the Defence of those who invest less?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions were clearly and fairly posed from this side of the pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how should the European side of the Alliance respond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-reality"&gt;ECONOMIC REALITY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, with frankness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to recognise that a problem exists in order to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what the problem is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many countries are failing to meet their financial responsibilities to NATO, and so failing to maintain appropriate and proportionate capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many are opting out of operations or contributing but a fraction of what they should be capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a European problem, not an American one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is a political problem, not a military one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the second thing we have to be is realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic and fiscal circumstances in which most developed countries find themselves makes this problem difficult to fix in the short term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his message to the Senate in 1949, President Truman talked of security and economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising a central historical truth - that military power and economic power are inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, the Marshall Plan and NATO were parts of the same strategy - a strategy to rebuild European power so that it could assist the United States in the containment of Soviet communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty years later the Cold War was won largely because the Soviet economic system could not sustain the investment in Defence required to match NATO’s power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without strong economies and stable public finances it is impossible to build and sustain, in the long-term, the military capability required to project power and maintain defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why today the debt crisis should be considered the greatest strategic threat to the future security of our nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the Government is tackling the budget deficit we inherited and a Defence programme that was over-heated and unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had to make some tough decisions to get the programme back on track and sustainable in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the British Armed Forces that will emerge from our Defence Review will be formidable, flexible and adaptable - supported by the fourth largest Defence budget in the world, meeting our NATO responsibilities and equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world. Pound for pound one of the world’s most capable fighting forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States itself, is having to rein in defence expenditure as a strategic imperative to bring budget deficits under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baseline from which the Pentagon is reducing is clearly in a different league to other NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the action being taken by the UK, by the US and other allies to bring their fiscal positions under control is itself a strategically essential underpinning to future sustainable defence capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the simple truth is clear: across the alliance, aggregate defence expenditure is certain to fall in the short term and, at best, recover slowly in the medium term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More money is not going to be the answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to maximise the capability we can squeeze out of the resources we have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritising ruthlessly; specialising aggressively and collaborating unsentimentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessity drives innovation - and it breaks down barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With budgets so tight, Allies need to revisit approaches and ideas that might previously have seemed politically unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary General’s Smart Defence points the way to how this is likely to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal in these straitened times is to deliver greater capability that is, crucially, available for operational use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="smart-defence"&gt;SMART DEFENCE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me suggest three ways we can make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this work needs to begin, and begin now, with an objective and clear-sighted assessment of the current state of NATO’s collective competence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This needs to take account of what we know of reductions that are already planned, how these impact on current capabilities and how well these capabilities are supported and able to be sustained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should stack that assessment up against NATO’s stated level of ambition - which is still less than one year old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will enable us to identify the gap that we need to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not be a comfortable exercise, but we need to start telling ourselves what our potential adversaries will already have worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an analysis will also provide a basis from which we can collectively direct the drive towards a number of capacity enhancing actions: greater pooling and sharing of capabilities; mission, role and geographic specialisation; greater sharing of technology; co-operation on logistics; alignment of research and development programmes; and more collaborative training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an exhaustive list, but contains what are likely to be the most promising ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we need to deal with the sensitive issue of political solidarity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alliance solidarity - particularly the Article 5 commitment - remains sacrosanct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we may need to think again about how like-minded Allies can operate better together for non-Article 5 operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems odd that non-NATO nations can use NATO’s SHAPE HQ and assets to undertake EU operations, so-called Berlin Plus, yet NATO Allies who want to undertake operations are unable to do so if there is no consensus at 28. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must find a way to allow the assets of the Alliance, including the Command Structure, to be used by the few on behalf of the many to implement the will of the wider international community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we need to build on the ability of non-Alliance members to contribute to NATO operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Libya and Afghanistan have shown how agile NATO can be in incorporating the contributions of outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should capitalise on this experience in making it easier to for non-NATO nations and key potential partners - such as Sweden, Australia, Qatar, UAE, Japan and South Korea - to contribute to NATO’s operations; to fight as well as facilitate, often without the caveats that some Alliance members insist upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="building-defence-partnerships"&gt;BUILDING DEFENCE PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why another part of making Smart Defence a success should be making the Alliance more flexible, encouraging collaboration among groups of Members, including with partners outside the Alliance, which could have the effect of boosting the overall capability of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an approach allows natural bi-lateral partnerships and regional groupings to flourish - and crucially has the capacity to add value to the capabilities available to the Alliance as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain is actively pursuing such collaborative initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Northern Group of nations, which includes the Baltic and Nordic countries, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands, as well as the UK, is part of this process for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Franco-British Defence Treaties, signed last year, herald another deepening partnership for the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision by France to rejoin NATO’s integrated command structure has opened the way for much wider Defence co-operation between our two countries which should deliver capability available to the NATO Alliance as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More widely, since the publication of our Strategic Defence and Security Review last October, we have signed three Defence Treaties, 26 Memorandums of Understanding and many other subordinate agreements with nations we see as key long-term partners, including NATO members like France and Turkey, and emerging powers such as Brazil and Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these relationships will enhance, not diminish, Britain’s ability to contribute to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an on-going programme - we are currently negotiating other agreements with a range of other key allies - and this is in addition to our extensive and intensifying defence co-operation with America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain’s commitment to retain our nuclear deterrent means that our collaboration with the US, which is historic, broad and deep, will continue and strengthen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be working closely with the US on a bi-lateral basis over the decade ahead as we regenerate our carrier-Strike capability, to the significant benefit of NATO. And I look forward to signing an agreement with Secretary Panetta later today that will set out how we will take that partnership forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach of building a network of targeted co-operation with key partners, within and outside of the NATO Alliance, is aimed at making Smart Defence real. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it shows what can be achieved when major defence nations put their minds to it - and when circumstances demand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different ways of working together and we should not be afraid to explore initiatives that add value to the capability of the Alliance as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for these initiatives to benefit the Alliance, the capability that is produced has to be additional and it has to be deployable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the going gets tough, we must resist the temptation of “cosmetic” capability and focus resolutely on that which is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen, the solidarity of the NATO Alliance is something we have come to take for granted over the decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there have been tensions from time to time, but that is always true within even the closest families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Secretary Gates and then Secretary Panetta have done is remind us that the Alliance cannot rest forever on the post 9/11 surge in US defence spending. And there could scarcely have been a more timely day to make that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a “crock of gold” anywhere in sight, that means we must renew our vows, and resolve to work smarter, to deliver more with less - by working ever more closely together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing so will provide reassurance to each other and to those who observe us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Chicago Summit provides the perfect opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also offer the chance for the NATO allies to demonstrate the same resolve in drawdown from Afghanistan, and in post 2014 support for ANSF, as they have in prosecuting the campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Europeans need to reassure the US that we are serious about defence; the US need to reassure Europe that you are not going away; and NATO as a whole needs to reassure the world of our solidarity and continued commitment to our own, and to the world’s security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth recalling that 20 years ago some powerful voices were questioning the continuation of NATO in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should therefore take some considerable satisfaction in the fact that NATO has proven itself both robust and flexible over the years, flourishing as its membership has grown, and its strategic concept has changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, perhaps, more than ever the challenge of renewal is urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen unfold over the last few years the most severe economic crisis to engulf the countries of the North Atlantic alliance since the 1930s - and it is not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when all of us face the same inexorable pressure to reduce deficits; when defence must compete for a share of a shrinking pot of money, it becomes ever more difficult to justify to our citizens delivering security for those who seem reluctant to value it by investing in it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the wake up call has come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s work together to ensure that the resourcefulness that has allowed us to triumph in adversity in the past, is used to turn this fiscal challenge into an opportunity;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opportunity to work more closely and effectively together,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strengthen and renew the NATO Alliance as it enters the next phase of its proud history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/12/08 - Delivering on the Frontline: Operational Success and Sustainable Armed Forces</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now just over a year since the publication of the Strategic Defence and Security Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was long overdue, and undeniably necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overdue because it represented the first thorough review of Defence for well over a decade - a decade during which the international environment had evolved dramatically, and Britain’s Armed Forces were operating at a consistently high tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessary to set a sustainable course for the transformation of Britain’s Armed Forces - to ensure they are structured, supported, and equipped to effectively protect our national security in the face of the threats they will encounter in the decades to come rather than for the challenges of the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Necessary, too, to tackle a forward defence programme that had been allowed to grow way beyond the resources available, particularly at a time when the overriding strategic requirement was, and remains, to bring order to the public finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it has been a year of transition in Defence, as we begin the difficult process of making the SDSR a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the midst of all this change, we must never forget that, since the publication of the SDSR, around 30,000 members of our Armed Forces, including many from the Reserves, have risked their lives for this country on operations in Afghanistan and in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today, I want to focus on the success of our Armed Forces during this year - protecting our national security by projecting military power far beyond our shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="afghanistan"&gt;AFGHANISTAN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because protecting this nation and our dependent territories against those who threaten our security is the primary purpose of Defence -whether it is standing operations such as defending the skies above Britain, protecting our trade routes or maintaining our continuous nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or whether it is on high intensity operations alongside allies and partners as in Libya and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Security Strategy set out clearly how Britain’s security and interests can only be defended by taking an active role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a role includes maintaining the capability and political will to intervene militarily - with law on our side, and alongside partners wherever possible - tackling potential threats to our own security at their source with diplomatic, development and military tools, rather than waiting for them to manifest themselves on the streets of our cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is precisely what the enduring campaign in Afghanistan is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan today, the operations of Britain’s Armed Forces, as part of a wide NATO-led coalition, are directly related to our national security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today our mission is to ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for international terrorism as it was under the Taliban before 9/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fighting there to diminish the threat on our streets here at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our goal is not a perfect Afghanistan, but one able to maintain its own security and prevent the return of international terror groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not there to impose a western liberal democracy, but we do recognise that an enduring solution in Afghanistan must embrace all its people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is not just a military campaign but as a comprehensive strategy linking progress on security with that on development and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achievement of our goal requires us to build the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and the Afghan Government, so that Afghans themselves can be responsible for their own territory, their own security and their own affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of the transition of lead security responsibility to the Afghan Government is on track, and set to complete by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Karzai recently announced the second tranche of transition so the Afghans are now beginning formally to take on responsibility for provision of security to over half the Afghan population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes Nad ‘Ali in Helmand Province - a place which, as the Chief of the Defence Staff reflected recently, was effectively a no go area when he was Commander of ISAF a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents very significant progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand, which entered the transition process in the first tranche in July, provides an increasing degree of assurance about the Afghan capability to manage security after 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the ANSF have dealt with all security incidents in Lashkar Gah city, without the need for ISAF support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has been a source of considerable pride, both to the Afghan security forces and to the civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we should be clear that Afghanistan will need continued support, albeit not combat support, for many years after 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we made clear on Monday, at the Bonn Conference, the UK stands ready, as part of the international effort, to provide that support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the ground in Afghanistan, as I’ve now had the chance to see for myself, there is clear evidence that the ISAF troop surge has brought security gains, limiting the insurgents’ ability to prosecute their campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK area of operations in Central Helmand the number of attacks by insurgent forces has decreased considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has encouraged something like normal life to return to many areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bazaars are opening. Schools are operating. Basic healthcare is being delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After decades of war, the population is understandably cynical, but through these small steps the Afghan Government is beginning to win the trust of the people and the power of the insurgency over hearts and minds is correspondingly waning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining that momentum will be the challenge of the transition process between now and the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us be under no illusion - the progress we have seen this year has been hard won and not irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurgency may be diminished and under considerable pressure but it remains a nationwide threat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the sectarian-inspired bombs this week demonstrate the complexity of the situation in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there is no room at all for complacency and much work needs to be done to maintain momentum and support the ANSF. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as they take a greater share of the responsibility for their own security, and bear more of the brunt of operations, so they bear a greater share of the sacrifice too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even with the improvement in security in Helmand, between October last year and  October this year, British Forces serving with 3 Commando Brigade, and before them 16 Air Assault Brigade, had an average of 14 significant contacts with insurgents every day, and uncovered around 900 Improvised Explosive Devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to pay tribute today to the 390 members of Britain’s Armed Forces who have lost their lives over this last ten years, fighting for our national security in Afghanistan, and also to the many, many more who have sustained life-changing injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a sobering and humbling experience for me to pay my respects to the dead, not only at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday, but also at the memorial at Camp Bastion on Armistice Day itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be no more poignant reminder that the sacrifice we commemorate each year is not just a historical fact, but a current living reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be crystal clear about one thing - our Forces will get the support they need to succeed in the task they have been set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However great our difficulties, nothing will be done that would compromise current operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful conclusion of the combat mission in Afghanistan is my first priority and the first priority for the Ministry of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="libya"&gt;LIBYA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much is talked about the pressure that Afghanistan places on our Forces and their capability to deal with contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much scepticism has been expressed about our ability to do anything else simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this year, our Armed Forces have shown that - even with the enduring campaign in Afghanistan - they have the capability and the capacity to respond when the national interest requires. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could, of course, have stood aside as Gadaffi made good on his promise to cleanse Benghazi house by house, street by street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thousands would have been killed; and a festering rogue state, with a grudge against Britain and all we stand for, would have emerged on Europe’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this would have been in our national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this would have served our national security - indeed it would have diminished it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the leadership shown by the United Kingdom and France, we had the authority to act through the United Nations; we had the power to act through NATO; and we had the support of the Arab League and neighbouring countries to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the action in Libya was necessary, legal and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response of our Armed Forces to the crisis in Libya was outstanding - displaying the very best of British military skill and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me just highlight a few of the milestones that Operation ELLAMY represented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the RAF Typhoon’s first multi-role contribution to operations -flying over 3,000 hours - proving the aircraft’s versatility, endurance, and, crucially, its reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army Air Corps Apache Helicopters were flown over contested territory from HMS Ocean for the first time in an amphibious strike role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has proven the Royal Navy’s Response Force Task Group concept - with the Navy’s ships clocking up 100,000 nautical miles in support of operations while undertaking separate, yet simultaneous, missions in different theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has proven the efficacy of the UK’s arsenal of precision guided weapons, and intelligence, surveillance and targeting systems in minimising civilian casualties and collateral damage, while maximising effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all significant British achievements, but of course are just a part of the overall effort - an effort undertaken by a wide coalition, focussed on political, diplomatic and humanitarian as well as military effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to be able to announce today that our final estimate of the net additional costs of operations in Libya is £212m - made up of £145m of operating costs, plus a further £67m million on replenishing munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is almost a third lower that the estimate my predecessor provided to Parliament in October - this is due to the speed with which operations were concluded and a re-assessment of the cost of replenishing munitions used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful outcome in every respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to take this opportunity to thank Liam Fox for the decisive leadership he showed as Secretary of State - not just in relation to Libya, but also for not shirking the difficult decisions taken as part of the SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-need-for-reform"&gt;THE NEED FOR REFORM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adaptable posture set in place by the SDSR is an effective answer to the volatile nature of the current international security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not have mentioned Libya by name, but the National Security Strategy placed an international crisis, drawing in the UK and its allies, in the top tier of risks over the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force structure set down in the SDSR provides the capability for us to continue to play our part in an international response to events during this period of transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our vision for Future Force 2020 is a strategy-led, resource informed blueprint for powerful, formidable and adaptable military forces configured for a new era - for the real world we live in and the real threats we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But implementing that vision requires bringing the defence budget into balance in order that Future Force 2020 is sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it requires reform of the way the MOD does its business - and indeed the way that the political leadership engages in the process -so that the same problems do not arise again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means taking the tough decisions now to build for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In opposition, when I was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, I worked closely with Liam Fox as the then Shadow Defence Secretary on our Party’s approach to the management of the MOD budget, to protect and enhance the capability of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear then, and even clearer now with the books open in front of us, that the way the Defence budget was managed over the last decade by the Labour Government was hugely damaging to our national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labour Ministers were ordering equipment they had no money to pay for and forced the military to live a hand to mouth existence in consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the budget spiralled out of control, and as the room for manoeuvre on individual projects was ever more constrained by contractual arrangements, decisions were increasingly taken on the basis of short-term cash management, not on military priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am a budget-balancer by instinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the purpose of the MOD isn’t simply to balance the books; it exists to ensure the defence of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by allowing the budget deficit in Defence to reach such unsustainable levels that it threatened the entire Defence Programme, the last Government betrayed the Armed Forces and utterly failed in its duty to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the situation we face now - after the years of political failure to grip the problem - is that eliminating the black hole in the Defence Budget is the only way to sustain military capability over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t reshape now we won’t be in a position to order new equipment and capability for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="firm-foundations"&gt;FIRM FOUNDATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our challenge is to move from the from fantasy budgets of the past to a firm foundation for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a transition that is essential to the future of Defence - but no-one should be under any illusion that it will be easy or that or will be pain-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future Force 2020 must be a force fit for the challenges of future warfare and the real world risks we are likely to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it must be built on a Defence programme that is affordable now and sustainable into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are siren voices, in the wake of the Libyan operation, calling for another wholesale rethink of Defence and Security - to have another SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opposition carps over the tough decisions we have had to take - decisions that they ducked because they were too difficult and politically uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is their legacy that constrains our ability to invest in new capabilities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They promised new Chinook helicopters, yet they had no money for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They committed to Trident replacement - but omitted to include the cost of it in their budget plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tied up their unaffordable shipbuilding programme in unbreakable contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They in effect had a fantasy defence programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now they agree that the MOD’s budget needs to be put on a stable footing, but refuse to say what they would cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are many valid and finely balanced arguments about the utility and necessity of individual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the decisions that were made in the SDSR had been easy, they would have been taken years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that as we work through the consequences of the strategy the SDSR put in place, we will continue to face those finely balanced choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s be under no illusions - unpicking the SDSR piece by piece is simply not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am clear that the end point the SDSR sets out for our Forces is the right one to meet the threats we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regret in particular, the cuts in personnel that are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have no doubt that the Armed Forces that will emerge from the implementation of the SDSR will be formidable, flexible and adaptable - structured to defend the country and project power abroad - equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world - a superbly trained and disciplined Force that will punch above what will anyway be a very considerable weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a vision of retrenchment; it is an ambitious programme of renewal after a decade of continuous operations and budgetary incontinence - a blueprint for a sustainable future as one of the world’s most capable fighting forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me be clear about my approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am determined that we neither compromise current operations nor constrain future Defence capability - that means we will not remove critical skills and capabilities that are irrecoverable - so that we retain the ability to scale up in the future if the threat demands it and the means permit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first rule is that whatever our current constraints, we must not preclude our successors from doing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my second is that our future strength lies in partnership and we must guard those assets, capabilities and competencies that allow us to add value to our most important alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we will not carelessly throw away core competencies that may be essential to our Defence in the future or which make us attractive alliance partners today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But operational effectiveness has to remain the watchword for everything we do and we will continue to learn from our experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will change and adapt with the evidence and the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will value our history and traditions - but we will not be slaves to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, I can announce today that I have accepted the recommendation of the First Sea Lord that women should be allowed to serve in submarines in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female officers will serve on the Vanguard Class submarines from late in 2013, followed by ratings in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women - officers and ratings - will also be able to serve on the Astute class submarines from about 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, as difficult and challenging as it will be, the transformation programme is essential to balancing our books and modernising our organisation - and that includes implementing both the blueprint of the SDSR and the Defence Reform agenda set out by Lord Levene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not a book-keeping exercise, or a management consultancy game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of what we are doing is to create the ability to deliver standing military tasks sustainably and project our formidable power when our national security requires it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may have come into the Ministry of Defence with a reputation as a numbers man, but I have quickly understood that Defence is a very human endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is not, I hasten to reassure you, me going soft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a recognition that the quality of our people is a potent force multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our cutting edge, high-tech equipment only comes to life with the skill, professionalism and commitment of those people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men and women of our Armed Forces are the greatest asset we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we are committed to rebuilding the Armed Forces Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is why it is my firm belief that when the Government asks our Armed Forces to put themselves in danger in pursuit of our national security, it is our duty to make sure they have the proper support and the best tools we can give them to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Defence, we now have a clear programme to deliver on this pledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our future Defence will be secured by the partnerships we make and the platforms we invest in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But above all it will be secured by the people who serve in our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over this last year, on operations in both Afghanistan and Libya, and on standing tasks at home and around the world - our Armed Forces have reminded us yet again why we value them so highly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look to the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014, I hear people asking what we will do to keep our Armed Forces occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a high-class problem to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in this volatile age I think it would be a bold man who would bet on a period of military idleness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever the future brings; whatever the challenges they are faced with - I do know that the men and women of our Armed Forces will rise to them magnificently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/12/06 - Defence Council Annual Reception</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to welcome you this evening in these magnificent surroundings of Lancaster House. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s a great pleasure to meet many of you here for the first time in my role as Defence Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you and your families are finding this a friendly and welcoming city in which to live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Disraeli once said that “London has a roost for every bird”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I hope you’ve found a few of those special little places that you will always remember fondly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We host here in London one of the largest communities of Defence Attaches and Advisers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It speaks to our history of international engagement and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It speaks to the many decades, in some cases centuries, of close working with the countries you represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also speaks to our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live - as the old saying goes - in interesting times - times of rapid change where it is difficult to predict with any certainty where the next threat will come from or where the next crisis will occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in this new era, no country, no matter how powerful, can hope to protect its national security by acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an era in which partnership is necessary, not optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the best partnerships are based on shared interests and shared values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most successful partnerships are those which maximise agreement and minimise divergence by making sure there exists a thorough understanding of how each partner approaches issues and makes decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That process may be driven by culture or tradition or national consciousness that it is difficult for outsiders to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be driven by calculations of risk and gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may even be driven by altruism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most often it is a combination of imperatives, pressures and personalities unique to each situation that drive policy and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating parts of your jobs is to understand why it is the United Kingdom comes to the conclusions it does - and to try an predict how we will react to any given situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, the more we understand one another, the more we reduce the capacity for mistakes - mistakes that in our line of work - where the security of our citizens are at stake - we cannot afford to make - let alone repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value hugely the work of our military attaches around the world.  They add value not only to us, but to the nations who host them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I have a great respect for the work that you do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is of mutual benefit, to the countries you represent and to Britain too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this year there has been a lot for you to get your teeth into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had to take a number of tough and finely balanced decisions to bring our Defence programme towards balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions similar to those many of our allies and partners are facing or may soon face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we have demonstrated in both Afghanistan and Libya, we have done so without diminishing our ambition or capability to play an active and responsible role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council, a leading member of NATO, the EU, the G8, G20, and of course the Commonwealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the 4th largest defence budget in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Armed Forces are among the best, most professional and most effective in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Afghanistan and Libya also demonstrate, it will be a very rare situation in which we are compelled by our national security to act alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our National Security Strategy sets out, action as part of a coalition, with allies and with partners, is by far the most likely, and most likely to be effective, way of working in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why since the publication of our Strategic Defence and Security Review last October, we have signed three Defence Treaties, 26 Memorandums of Understanding and many other subordinate agreements between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are designed to strengthen collaboration, joint working, information sharing, inter-operability and industrial co-operation with partners and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because of the benefits they bring, even in these financially difficult times we remain committed to our own network of Defence Attaches and Advisers abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Foreign Secretary has said, “Nothing will come to us by right, or by virtue of the past.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust, co-operation, and friendship must be earned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for us this is about building credible, personal, and sustainable relationships that will stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope that your Governments continue to value and support your role here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our intention over the years ahead to grasp the opportunity that you represent, and to continue to build the partnerships that are necessary for success in this interconnected and networked world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that you do a fantastic job here in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Ladies and Gentlemen, let me take this opportunity, on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, to wish you and your families all the best for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Independent review recommends ‘a fresh start’ for the management of England’s strategic roads</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major savings for taxpayers and benefits for the national economy could be unlocked by reforming the government’s management of England’s motorways and trunk roads, says an &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/strategic-roads-network"&gt;independent review&lt;/a&gt; published today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the day of the publication of the review, Alan Cook said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The management of our strategic roads is at odds with every other major infrastructure sector in the UK. By applying the lessons learnt by the best performing companies in other sectors, there is the potential to save taxpayers at least £200 million a year after 5 years, and to provide a much better service for road users and the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The report recommends that the Secretary of State for Transport should take on a new, more strategic role in the management of the network, providing longer-term funding certainty for the organisation and acting as a champion for the interests of road users and the economy through a performance specification with tough new targets for efficiency and customer service. Alongside of this, the report also recommends reforming the status of the current Highways Agency, giving it a more independent board, which can make better and more flexible commercial decisions with greater financial autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Cook concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The importance of this network to the growth of the economy is enormous. It handles a third of all traffic in England and two-thirds of all freight traffic. But policy makers need to be much clearer about what they want the network to deliver in return for the public money that is spent on it. Meeting the country’s current economic and financial challenges demands a change in our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/strategic-roads-network"&gt;full report and a set of frequently asked questions is available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>2011/10/24 - Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) Annual Defence Industry Dinner</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a great pleasure to be with you here today and be offered my first opportunity as Secretary of State to speak to the wider defence community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am honoured that the Prime Minister has asked me to serve in this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been my good fortune to do so in time to witness the final end of Gaddafi’s brutal 40 year rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to pay tribute to the role our Armed Forces played in the liberation of Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have done a magnificent job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya has also shown the utility of the high-tech platforms, such as Typhoon, and high-precision weaponry, such as Brimstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to hit targets, from distance, with high-impact but low risk of collateral damage was incredibly important in an operation where the aim was not the destruction of a country but the protection of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to pay tribute to my predecessor, Liam Fox, for the decisive leadership he showed as Secretary of State - not just in relation to Libya but also in taking many of the tough decisions required to put our Armed Forces on the road to a sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Liam closely both in opposition and in Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has always been a passionate and intelligent advocate for the Armed Forces and for the robust defence of our national security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the challenge of completing what he started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="people-matter"&gt;PEOPLE MATTER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence is one of the most important departments of Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is also one of the most complex and challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know I will be working with the bravest, most selfless and professional people the country has to offer - the men and women of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they are supported by some of the most dedicated people in the public service, the most highly skilled workforces in British industry and some of the most committed people in the charitable sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to have the opportunity so early on to thank SSAFA for all the hard work that is done day in, day out, week in, week out to support serving personnel, their families and the veterans community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first official engagement was to accompany the Prime Minister to the ceremony conferring Royal status on Wootton Bassett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reinforced for me just how important the Armed Forces are to the British public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also saw something else - I saw just how important public support is to the men and women of our Armed Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing they have such high levels of public approval helps them stand tall as they deal with the daily challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is part of the reason why organisations like SSAFA are so important - not only providing practical help - but providing the public with a meaningful way to express their respect and admiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-challenging-environment"&gt;A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As all of us in this room know, this is a difficult time for the country, and for Defence in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are dealing with the toughest economic climate in a generation and the biggest budget deficit in our peacetime history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, in Defence, we have also to deal with the legacy of an unaffordable equipment programme and a decade of operations at a continuously high tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do so at a time when the threats to our national security and our national interests are evolving fast - and by no means diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at a time when our Armed Forces, including a substantial number of reservists, remain engaged in a dangerous and enduring mission in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a vital operation to protect our national security by ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for international terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will make it a priority to get out to theatre to visit our troops as soon as possible, so I can see at first hand the superb job we all know they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="formidable-armed-forces"&gt;FORMIDABLE ARMED FORCES&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first focus of Defence must be the delivery of success on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projection of military power is, after all, the raison d’etre of the Armed Forces and the MOD: everything else is a supporting role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is my firm belief that when the Government asks the men and women of our Armed Forces to put themselves in danger in pursuit of our national security, we owe it to them to make sure they are properly supported and have the best tools we can give them to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Defence, we now have a clear programme to deliver on this pledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces that will emerge from the implementation of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) will be formidable, flexible and adaptable - structured to defend the country and project power abroad - equipped with some of the best and most advanced technology in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astute Class Submarines, Type 45 Destroyers, Global Combat Ship, Queen Elizabeth Class Carriers, Joint Strike Fighter, Typhoon, Voyager, Foxhound, Warrior, Watchkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a vision of retrenchment; it is an ambitious programme of renewal after a decade of continuous operations - a blueprint for a sustainable future as one of the world’s most capable fighting forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="strong-economy-strong-defence"&gt;STRONG ECONOMY, STRONG DEFENCE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now a year since the publication of the SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that it has been a year of difficult decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that the changes being made are directly affecting people’s lives and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have already, in my first week, heard something of the many valid and finely balanced arguments about the utility and necessity of this capability or that capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me be clear about my approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am determined that we neither compromise current operations nor constrain future Defence capability - that we do not remove critical skills and capabilities that are irrecoverable - and that we retain the ability to scale up in the future if our national security demands it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to be a strong and passionate advocate for our Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence both within government and with the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will advance the interests of Defence and national security at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s be under no illusions - if you want first class Armed Forces you need a first class economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no future for a big military supported by a small economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is littered with examples showing that to be a fast track way to a collapse in global influence and military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was one of the central lessons of the Cold War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future Force 2020 must be built on firm foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, with a force structure that is fit for the challenges of future warfare and the real world risks we are likely to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, with a Defence programme that is affordable now and sustainable into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpicking the SDSR piece by piece is simply not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transformation programme is essential to balance our books and modernise our organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am clear that this is the only way to ensure success on operations and the continued ability to project military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me end where I began - with the men and women of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military effectiveness is built not only on economic success; it is built on people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men and women of our Armed Forces are the greatest asset we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence is a very human endeavour - and the consequences of service life are very human too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why the work of SSAFA and other service charities is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can assure you that, during my tenure in office, the commitment to rebuild the Armed Forces Covenant will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will mean all of us working together - Government at all levels, working together with charities and the private sector, to look after our serving personnel and their families, and our veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a big challenge ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Succeeding on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking after our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the adaptable Armed Forces this country needs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And balancing the books in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only been in this job for a week but already I can be confident that working together we can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Armed Forces deserve no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
