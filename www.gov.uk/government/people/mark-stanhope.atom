    <title>2012/10/02 - Navies in an Age of Austerity</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Ty [Rear Admiral Tyrone Pile RCN (Retd)] for your kind introduction……and may I add my thanks for such a splendid dinner this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L &amp;amp; G, it’s a privilege to share in this Conference……and a pleasure to be in Canada again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And living in an island nation, I feel very much at home here in Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the House of Commons, during WWII……when our navies fought courageously to keep the sea lanes open……the Conservative politician Irene Ward asked the Minister of Supply……”why Wrens [Women’s Royal Naval Service] of the Royal Navy had to wait for their uniforms”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minister replied that there were problems in providing uniforms for the Navy, and that sailors had been given priority over Wrens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which Ward responded……”How long is the Minister prepared to hold up the skirts of Wrens for the convenience of His Majesty’s sailors?”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L &amp;amp; G, I do not intend to hold up tonight’s proceedings……but I do want to make a couple of points on an important subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s often tempting, and certainly understandable, to look at today’s issues through today’s lens……but perhaps looking at our challenges through tomorrow’s lens instead could offer a useful additional perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So……fast forward, if you will, to say 2024 please……12 years hence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow……looking at you now, you’ve all aged remarkably well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all just enjoyed yet another fantastic Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our mid-seniority officers back in 2012 are now running our Nations’ Navies……grateful, I hope, for the legacies we left them……enjoying the mutual fruits of our Anglo-Canadian Joint Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the US has finally ratified UNCLOS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst inevitably, our world of 2024 has changed in ways which were unforeseen……some of the forecasts appear to have, for good or bad, come to pass:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The threat environment is certainly more complex……as well as more contested, congested, cluttered, connected and constrained. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The world now has a billion more mouths to feed than it did back in 2012……a 14% increase. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost everyone in Africa has a mobile phone. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And if 2012 predictions are still correct, then next year, in 2025, China will constitute around 30% of the world’s GDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maritime Environment in 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this has had profound consequences; culturally, economically and militarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, just as many of us forecast 12 or so years ago……the maritime environment has indeed become the space in which threats, opportunities and interests have presented themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, in 2012, the Defence Reviews of Canada, the US, the UK, China, Japan, India and Australia, amongst others, had a common theme……one of ‘looking seaward’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with the benefit of hindsight, they were right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflect for a moment upon the extent to which our international straits and our oceans have occupied our attention over the last decade……I suspect they will continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that we should be surprised by any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, 5 of the 6 “pivotal regions”……regions, in which global trends have converged, giving them an importance disproportionate to their geopolitical status……5 of the 6 regions have a maritime dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include the wider Middle East, the Asian Meridian, sub-Saharan Africa, both Polar regions and the Korean peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I highlight just two regions where our navies have prevented the arteries of trade, of the global economy, from hardening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Asian Meridian……from Hong Kong to Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 years ago, the region….sitting astride the Malacca and Lombok Straits……saw a fifth of global oil production transported through it……including over 80% of China’s oil imports and 80% of all Japan’s imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, that dependency has continued to grow……placing the region today as an increasingly important intersection of major-power spheres of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth in defence spending along the Meridian has continued……and substantial investment increases in maritime and air capabilities are by no means an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is the access and resource in the High North……which has, with the opening up of the Northern Sea Route, transformed patterns of global maritime trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it would appear that previous forecasts of regular transit of the North West Passage by 2030, just 6 years from now, will indeed come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is with gratitude that we look back to those in positions of influence……in the arctic nations and the wider international maritime community……for embracing the safe, ecologically sound and sustainable use of this magnificent polar ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were a perceptive lot in 2012 weren’t they?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, they were also right when they argued that there would be two main emerging maritime themes in the first half of this Century……increasing littoral complexity and growing oceanic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacies from 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back then in 2012……in the midst of those seven lean years……do you remember how global austerity brought an added complexity to our deliberations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were difficult years for us all, but allow me to remind you of 3 things in particular which I think have since stood us in good stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, those in 2012 contributed to a narrative that helped the world recognise it was about to embark on an emerging maritime era……and wake it up to the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nations, even those with limited coastlines, began to realise that……with an increasing global economic dependency upon the sea……their ability to control or deny access to the sea was, even more so than before, a security issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since then, our “economisation of international security affairs” has indeed had a strong maritime dimension, playing out as it has in those ‘pivotal regions’……as it will continue to do I suspect in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the narrative was not of course just economic.  It was about the largely ungoverned space of our global commons becoming a security issue in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ungoverned space which, if unchecked, could become a vector for global security threats like piracy, international maritime terrorism, human trafficking, and potential conflicts over energy security and resource depletion.  Issues which the conference in Victoria in the fall of 2012 discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which remain de-stabilising influences with the potential to descend into conflict.  And, in turn, with disastrous consequences for global trade and international and domestic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now, there are still some ‘continental’ commentators who persist in asking “so what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said back then, and I say again……from my perspective, as sure as the wind blows from high to low pressure, so the high pressure of future insecurity will fill the low pressure of our largely ungoverned global commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That narrative is still important, but it was vital in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, and my second point, it ensured that……especially under the microscope of austerity……navies were seen to be relevant, as of course they remain today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austerity demanded that navies contributed to that maritime narrative by being ‘at sea’ and ‘at readiness’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so navies demonstrated their value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By being at sea, forward deployed, our navies provided persistent presence in regions of interest……ensuring that navies delivered maritime power.……that ‘effect from the sea’……with the greatest expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by maintaining confidence in sea trade……upon which countries like ours have been built; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by building trust with international partners; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by bringing reassurance to fragile states; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by preventing the consequences of illegal activity reaching our shores; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and by deterring potential aggressors from challenging our national interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bottom line was this……the navies that remained relevant were the navies deployed ‘at sea’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as I’ve always maintained……navies need to be ‘at sea’ because……”the more one deploys, the less one needs to be kinetic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not just about being ‘at sea’ of course……it was also about being ‘at readiness’ for any contingency when on station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about having the ‘spectrum of capabilities’ to respond swiftly at the right level……and right across the ‘spectrum of uncertainty’……as world events have served to remind each and every one of us……on a number of occasions since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such security came with a cost, magnified in an age of austerity.  But I would still maintain that given the events in recent years we were wiser to spend money on prevention early, rather than on intervention late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Professor Colin Gray once observed……”the greatest value of the Navy will be found in events that fail to occur because of its influence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which at a time when value for money was uppermost in our minds, the small marginal cost of operating ships with their organic aircraft and submarines at sea, rather than being garrisoned in naval bases, simply made good sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps, as we look back on 2012, it is my third point that gives us greatest reason to be…….just a little smug!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, we ensured that the flame of cooperation was not extinguished by austerity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, together, we allowed it to ignite a larger beacon of multinational maritime cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, we ensured that the provision of maritime security was a global solution to a global problem……a global solution based upon global cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, in the Middle East region, the 26-nation Combined Maritime Force……which still provides maritime security for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or back in 2011, where the 16-nation maritime element of NATO’s Operation Unified Protector helped liberate Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the list goes on……but it is such levels of multinational maritime cooperation that gives confidence to the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both to maritime users and the commerce that depends upon global trade.  Keeping seas safe as we would wish our streets to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one level, it has promoted trust between the military forces of different nations, encouraged transparency and, over time, has crucially expanded intelligence sharing……so fundamental to making the most efficient use of our increasingly limited number of ships and aircraft in targeting areas of crises and contacts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also, over time, led to greater international technical collaboration……so important in those austere times……as we sought to secure greater value for money in future procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I would suggest that the biggest benefit of maritime cooperation……has been and remains strategic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime security operations are an example of the successful use of ‘soft power’.  The ability to influence events on land, by being there at sea.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has been a demonstration to the international community of national commitment to protecting the global good, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it has reinforced shared values, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and widened the circle of cooperation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L &amp;amp; G, as we bask in the benefit of hindsight that the year 2024 bestows upon us……as we reflect on our collective wisdom of past decisions……and give ourselves self-congratulatory slaps on the back……I am reminded of the possibly apocryphal story of an Education Department’s inspection of a junior school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspection was going very well indeed until the last lesson……a religious studies period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher was expounding on the Old Testament and, seeking greater pupil involvement, asked a question……”Who knocked down the walls of Jericho?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny, a small boy at the back of the class……a perpetrator of a number of classroom misdemeanours……thrust his hand up and gave his answer smartly……”It wasn’t me”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L &amp;amp; G, as I finish, let’s wind the clock back to 2012……to the decisions we are taking this year……as a result of this Conference, amongst others……and in our dialogue with Governments, Departments &amp;amp; Navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such decisions represent an opportunity to get maritime security right for the future……for 2024, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let us ensure that it is not us who have to admit in years to come that……”it wasn’t me”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, let us ensure that we are ready to operate in the maritime security environment as we experience it today……but more importantly, as we perceive it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by contributing to the maritime narrative; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by turning austerity into an opportunity……to demonstrate maritime power’s relevance and value for money……with navies being ‘at sea’ and ‘at readiness’; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and by ensuring that the beacon of maritime cooperation burns brighter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;……I hope that we will leave our successors in 2024 a legacy……of which they can be pleased……and of which we can be proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you……and I look forward to your questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/07/04 - RUSI Future Maritime Operations Conference 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Michael for inviting me to address this year’s RUSI Maritime Conference…..at which I’m grateful to hear the Minister’s endorsement of the maritime dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most here would agree I think…..that security and prosperity are two sides of the same national interest coin.And so I welcome the fact that as an island nation…..the maritime is recognised as bringing value to that national interest coin…..despite inflationary pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="utility-of-maritime-power"&gt;Utility of Maritime Power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cast your minds back, if you will, to Tuesday 8th May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When after their FA Cup Final defeat…..Liverpool beat Chelsea 4-1 at Anfield….. and when the anniversary of VE day was being commemorated around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also on that day…..in pursuit of our national interests…..the Royal Navy had as it typically does…..over 40 ships and submarines, and some 3500 sailors and marines…..on operations worldwide or undergoing pre-deployment training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that day in the Gulf…..our MCMs were on operational notice for mine clearance…..whilst also participating in a multinational exercise…..with Oman, the US, France and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which the Type 45 Destroyer HMS DARING also participated…..whilst contributing to wider Combined Task Force 150 maritime security operations…..in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.And RFA FORT VICTORIA also joined the exercise…..whilst acting as the Flagship for Rear Admiral Likitawong Royal Thai Navy…..in command of CTF 151 units undertaking counter-piracy ops in the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day HMS WESTMINSTER was charged with maritime security and maritime counter-terrorism responsibilities…..around the southern Arabian Gulf in direct support of CTF 152.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile…..on Tuesday 8th May…..our Naval Air Squadrons were operating out of Mussanah in Oman…..as well as Camp Bastion and Kandahar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that same day, HMS DAUNTLESS had undertaken a successful counter-drugs op…..having just assumed Atlantic Patrol Task (South) duties from HMS MONTROSE.And the submarine HMS TALENT off South Africa…..was looking forward to an operational stand down in Simon’s Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in home waters the Olympics LIVEX was underway…..with HMS BULWARK and RFA MOUNTS BAY off Weymouth…..and HMS OCEAN here in London…..whilst 45 Commando remained primed for contingent tasking as the nation’s Lead Commando Group…..and 40 Commando continued their preparations for deployment to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further afield…..HMS PROTECTOR, our Ice Patrol Ship, was transiting the Panama Canal…..having supported the British Government’s wider commitment to the Antarctic Treaty.And on Tuesday 8th May…..we continued to provide the Strategic Deterrent.The list goes on…..I’m proud the list goes on…..but I won’t. However, from this rapid sweep across the operational horizon, I do want to make a couple of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="smart-power"&gt;Smart Power&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, maritime power’s contribution to smart power…..which the Minister referred to earlier…..and which I hope this Conference will deepen our understanding of exactly what that contribution means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart power…..this ability to employ both soft and hard power assets more effectively…..and with all the levers of national power…..to produce more enduring outcomes…..is especially relevant in an age of austerity. And is precisely what we were doing on Tuesday 8th May…..and indeed what we do every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the maritime power that we uniquely provide…..not one of the activities…..nor their accompanying effects…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;of international reassurance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of capacity building&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of promoting collective security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of deterrence…..not one of these effects that we seek to leverage, would have been accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is this capacity for maritime power to deliver effect….in more nuanced ways…..that makes it, I believe, the epitome of smart power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because the delivery of smart power places a premium on prevention…..the ultimate prize in our National Security Strategy…..exercising smart power has a number of implications for navies…..not least for the RN contribution to Defence Engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="at-sea"&gt;At Sea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and most obviously…..navies need to be forward deployed…..at sea. Just as we were on Tuesday 8th May…..working with many other navies…..a number of which I’m pleased to see are represented here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only by having a persistent presence in regions of interest…..can navies deliver maritime power…..that ‘effect from the sea’…..with the greatest expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by maintaining confidence in sea trade upon which we depend;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by building trust with an ever-widening circle of international partners;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by bringing reassurance to fragile states;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by preventing the consequences of illegal activity reaching our shores;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and by deterring potential aggressors from challenging our national interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I like to put it, “the more one deploys, the less one needs to be kinetic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="at-readiness"&gt;At Readiness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about being ‘at sea’…..it’s also about being ‘at readiness’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about having the capabilities to respond swiftly…..and right across the ‘spectrum of uncertainty’…..as world events last year served to remind each and every one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider for example, one of the key innovations that came out of the SDSR….. the Response Force Task Group…..already mentioned by the Minister…..and otherwise known as the RFTG…..that proved so successful in achieving effective influence across the Maghreb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RFTG is a highly capable quick-reaction force…..consisting of ships, aircraft and marines…..and as such is suited to a wide range of Defence tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from maritime strike to disaster relief
and from amphibious operations to civilian evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways it’s the cornerstone of the “Adaptable Britain” security posture articulated in the SDSR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why we can look forward to the RFTG becoming all the more capable…..as Carrier Strike comes on line from 2018.With its return…..our ability to influence events ashore…..whether by promoting stability, deterring aggression, or providing options for military intervention…..will become correspondingly much more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this audience hardly needs reminding of the utility of air power from the sea…..nor of just how compelling an expression it is of our nation’s outward-looking character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to the utility of air power from the sea…..for the UK, the year 1989 is instructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that, not because it was the year the Berlin Wall came down…..but because it was the only year…..between 1945 and 2010…..that the UK did not deploy her Carriers in support of her national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply…..countries that aspire to strategic international influence have aircraft carriers…..and countries that have them, use them.Air power from the sea was an important part of our national story last century….. and it will continue to be a vital part of our national story this century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to return for a moment to this broader notion…..that exercising smart power places a premium on prevention, which in turn demands navies to be ‘at readiness’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two aspects of being ‘at readiness’. The first is straightforward…..it’s about speed of response. The second aspect concerns this spectrum of tasking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, our ability to be ‘smart’…..is a function of the recognition given to matching the ‘spectrum of capabilities’…..with the ‘spectrum of uncertainty’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, smart power is only as effective as the range of hard and soft options it has at its disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this includes the employment of all the levers of national power…..but within the military sphere…..and the maritime component specifically…..it’s about providing the greatest range of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constabulary capabilities absolutely…..but high-end warfighting too. And of course…..if you can do the latter…..you can by implication do the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying…..but I will…..that if your deployed units are capable only of providing constabulary tasks…..then when a more robust response in the region is required…..a prompt, timely reaction simply is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we’re investing in highly capable Type 45 Destroyers…..three of which are now on deployment. And that is why we’re maximising the versatility of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though…..effective prevention is about credible deterrence. Of course we need to be able to respond to the ‘most likely’…..but we must also be able to respond to the ‘most dangerous’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart power needs the capacity to be an effective influence across both. And so it makes sense therefore that…..if you want to keep your options open…..you have to invest in those capabilities which offer options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="value-of-integration"&gt;Value of Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst maritime power offers such ‘options’…..in my view…..what makes it an important component of smart power, is its ability to integrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one level, as indeed the Minister alluded, maritime power already integrates much of the cross-Government agenda…..by contributing to national security and prosperity in a number of ways…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from meeting SOCA’s requests in the area of counter-narcotics,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to maintaining confidence in maritime insurance;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and from protecting our energy security,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to understanding the consequences of climate change;…..there’s not much that maritime power doesn’t actually touch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, at another level, maritime power integrates nations…..because our shared global commons, drives shared common purpose.As a result, interoperability comes naturally to maritime forces…..
just think of the 16-nation maritime element off Libya last year,
or the 25 navies in the Combined Maritime Force in the Middle East,
or the multinational exercise I mentioned earlier…..that was taking place in the Gulf of Oman on Tuesday 8th May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But above all…..maritime forces instinctively understand the integration of joint capability…..to deliver joint effect.Routinely operating at sea…..from the sea to the air…..and from the sea to the land…..integrating the environments is what we do.As mariners, we know our environment…..as we have to understand the risks that attend operations in this most hostile of surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, personnel operating at sea…..be they aviators or marines for instance …..need to be experts in the maritime environment. As such, the risks…..unique to the operation of aircraft from ships…..and marines to the shore…..are fully understood and the operating envelope fully exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more…..in an era when value for money is uppermost in our minds…..it won’t be lost on you that forces designed to operate at sea…..or from the sea…..can also operate ashore…..while the converse is not usually the case.Take the Fleet Air Arm, the Fleet Diving Unit and Royal Marines, amongst other naval personnel, in Afghanistan…..where we witness the adaptable nature of maritime forces to other environments at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this…..the instinctive capacity of maritime forces to integrate….. maximises their utility and their employment…..and they offer real opportunities to be smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen…..to conclude.In a world that, for economic and security reasons…..is beginning to ‘look seaward’ again…..in terms of threats, opportunities and interests…..a maritime perspective, with its ability to integrate…..brings welcome value, especially in these straitened times, to the national interest coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the wide utility of maritime forces gives maritime power a breadth of expression…..which can make a telling contribution to the delivery of smart power…..especially in terms of upstream prevention. To which being ‘at sea’ and being ‘at readiness’ are vital features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Defence is about preventing wars…..we can only do so if we can win them…..and that means we must retain the capability to operate…..nationally and multinationally…..right across the ‘spectrum of uncertainty’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivering security in an age of austerity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global austerity is driving radical re-thinking as to how nations deliver security and defence in the future. The First Sea Lord and Head of the Royal Navy explains why maritime power provides part of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and thank you Lord Lothian for your kind introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Future Security Environment]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I might begin by answering a question that I’m often asked, “What form will our future global security environment take?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question that many here will be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For understanding our future environment is the first step to establishing how - particularly in these straitened times - we might wish to shape it and how we might have to engage with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I believe it will be an environment that is - as it always has been - dynamic. One that is complex, multi-dimensional and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be an environment in which wealth and opportunity will increasingly be in the hands of the minority. Less equitably distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An environment in which competition for scarce resources will continue to intensify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An environment which - largely because the conveyor belts of globalisation are accelerating us closer together - will lead to nation states’ economic, political and security interests being affected, both more rapidly and more unpredictably by world events. Events over which we shall have little direct control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, who would have anticipated the sweep of insecurity across the Maghreb and Levant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that the global economic crisis would acquire such magnitude? - and start to raise issues of national security and alliance solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And reflect too, for a moment, upon the kaleidoscope of world events over the last 12 months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the crisis in Libya, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the massacre in Norway, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;famine and piracy around the Horn of Africa, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the earthquake in Turkey last October, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Iranian nuclear challenge, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the rise in the flow of narcotics from Latin America, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the destabilising behaviour of North Korea, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and the internal unrest in Syria,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to name but a few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s little wonder that - together with a number of other countries - the UK’s National Security Strategy concludes that, “the risk picture is likely to become increasingly diverse”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this common strategic context, as well as the, largely, shared experiences of fiscal restraint - necessarily placing difficult demands at many Defence Department doors - it strikes me that, like it or not, many nations are sailing through the same strategic storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping on course through that storm is the challenge. A challenge which requires us to reconcile this breadth of uncertainty with the depth of fiscal reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us here would recognise that national security and economic prosperity are two sides of the same national interest coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why the UK’s Secretary of State for Defence is very clear that, “Restoring sound public finances is a Defence imperative as well as an economic one, and Defence must make its contribution to delivering them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOD organisational reform and capability re-balancing for the future is, of course, part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so too is working more closely with other nations. For what ever the political rhetoric of the past, no country has the capacity, nor the political appetite, to respond to every conceivable threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Collective Defence]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of austerity Collective Defence - educating, training, procuring and operating with other nations - is, as the Secretary of State puts it, “the only practical response to the world we live in”. And it’s a response to which maritime forces are well-suited. I suppose I would say that wouldn’t I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So some evidence. It’s principally because our high seas - our global commons - necessitates, by its shared nature, an inherently collective mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, interoperability is instinctive to maritime forces - founded on a legacy of years of global operations, building and servicing partnerships, within NATO, the EU, the FPDA, and with a plethora of key allies, most notably the United States and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, in the Middle East region, the 25-nation Combined Maritime Force which provides maritime security for the benefit of all. A good example of where global problems are being addressed by global solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or last year, where the 16-nation maritime element of NATO’s Operation Unified Protector helped liberate Libya. Indeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Navy submarines conducted coordinated strike operations with the US; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our frigates and minehunters integrated instantly into NATO Task Groups; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HMS OCEAN’s operations were coordinated with NATO and French forces; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and OCEAN’s Air Group - of Sea King, Lynx and Apache helicopters - was also fully integrated into NATO’s air operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collective Defence certainly makes good sense. It always has done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think it is our approach to how the UK wishes to exercise its individual or collective influence around the world that merits closer examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Flexibility in thinking]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a more imaginative, proactive stance on security should be within our fiscal means, provided we are prepared to think again at how we deliver it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility in our thinking is the vital precondition to achieving a more realistic response to the speed and unpredictability of events which characterise the security environment of our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the National Security Strategy’s ‘whole of government’ approach is a welcome restatement of strategic principles. And the establishment of the National Security Council to provide prompt, coherent and co-ordinated decision-making on all aspects of national security is a positive step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if we are to truly balance resources with commitments - power with interests - it certainly makes sense to be more prepared to employ all the levers of national power in addressing the security challenges we face. And, if consensus can be achieved, to join with others - state and non-state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as commentators such as Joseph Nye observe, whilst military power will always have its place, the networked world potentially allows us to achieve outcomes through more subtle use of all the levers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The academic and author Parag Khanna goes a step further perhaps, suggesting that, “when government, business and NGOs work together, real progress can be made”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the networked world has the potential to truly galvanise dot.gov, dot.com and dot.org into generating a more dynamic and innovative response to the challenges presented by the future security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Whitehall shares that intent as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the increasing demand for smarter inter-agency planning and delivery - be it for humanitarian assistance, capacity building or law enforcement, for example - whether nationally or as part of an international effort, is the consequence of a growing shift towards thinking in much broader terms about what security means and how it can most effectively - and efficiently - be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction a few years ago of what was called the ‘Comprehensive Approach’, and now referred to in the UK as the ‘Integrated Approach’ is, in my view, receiving a well-deserved reinvigoration. An approach where the levers of power and the many associated actors are considered as individual melodic lines weaved into a complex counterpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an approach is at the heart of the emerging thinking behind ‘Smart Power’. The ability to create - to compose - more enduring outcomes and effects with the more elaborate employment of both soft and hard power assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s an approach that needs constantly working at. After all, complex counterpoint isn’t harmonious - isn’t musical - by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, that all said, I do believe that there is scope for the military line to be weaved into the counterpoint more imaginatively - to help deliver, in these straitened times especially, the same effect with less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Flexibility in employment]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to understand the UK Armed Forces’ activity only in terms of their engagement in conflict. This is perhaps an inevitable consequence of the focus on the Campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the range of operations undertaken by the component elements of the Armed Forces is actually much wider than simply operations as we might know them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in Afghanistan for example, considerable effort is being placed upon providing advice and training to the Afghan National Security Forces through our Brigade Advisory Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we move towards 2015 the focus will shift almost exclusively onto a Train, Advise and Assist role to the Afghan National Security Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, through next year and beyond, the Flagship project of longer-term UK military involvement in Afghanistan will be our support to the development of the Afghan National Army Officers’ Academy in Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a tendency to view the deployment of the military as a last resort. But I think that the military can, and should, be part of a more nuanced first resort - to better understand the security situation so that we can improve our ability to anticipate tension, as well as to do something to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why in a world that, for economic and security reasons, is beginning to ‘look seaward’ again - in terms of threats, opportunities and interests - the recently established UK cross-Government National Maritime Information Centre for example is a real asset. Good intelligence allows us to be more judicious with the assets we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also think that we can do more in the coming years to shape our Armed Forces so that they can be used more effectively to help address security risks, earlier on, as part of our commitment to conflict prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, ‘upstream prevention’ as part of the emerging Defence Engagement Strategy which is complementary to cross-government efforts. A strategy to which, in my view, maritime forces are uniquely equipped to make a significant contribution - be it multinational exercises, training, port visits and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such recognition that Defence is as much about preventing wars as it is about winning them, also places an increasing premium upon the role of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, the value of persistent presence in regions of interest - whether to signal national intent, gather intelligence and form insights, contribute to capacity building or to reassure others - can not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need therefore to maintain a credible war-fighting capability, able to operate and be maintained at range, is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I say that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you cannot deter effectively unless it is understood by those whose behaviours you seek to influence that you can intervene militarily with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you cannot keep the peace unless you are physically there, and prepared to be able to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, the more one deploys, the less one needs to be kinetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To return to my musical metaphor, maritime power is the ‘leitmotif’ in the counterpoint of future compositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this means that navies need to be at sea and at readiness - with the capabilities to respond swiftly across the ‘spectrum of uncertainty’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing so allows navies to deliver maritime power - effect from the sea - with the greatest expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by maintaining confidence in sea trade; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by building trust with an ever-widening circle of international partners; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by bringing hope to fragile states; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by preventing the consequences of illegal activity reaching our shores; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and by deterring potential aggressors from challenging our national interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why last year, for example, some 8000 sailors and marines - around a quarter of the Royal Navy’s trained strength - were deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the Submarine Service had its busiest year since the second Gulf War, with SSN deployments averaging some 263 days, 90% of which was at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, in early October, around 45 of the Royal Navy’s 62 available vessels, nearly 75%, were underway or forward-deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, such a notion of ‘upstream prevention’ is not new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Navy has been operating in the Arabian Gulf, ashore, afloat, in the skies and beneath the waters since 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Tanker War of the mid-1980s, we were there providing escort protection to tankers laden with oil through the Strait of Hormuz while the Iran-Iraq war was being waged around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were still there for the first Gulf War in 1991, when our ships and aircraft rapidly defeated the Iraqi Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed to enforce the UN’s economic sanctions against Saddam Hussein’s regime before supplying and landing the amphibious forces that took control of the Al Faw peninsula, the gateway to Basrah, in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the Royal Navy devoted resources to passing on our expertise in training the fledgling Iraqi Navy and Marines as well as facilitating detente between Iraq and Kuwait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today, the Royal Navy remains there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conducting mine-clearance preparatory operations in the Gulf; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deterring the illegal and damaging smuggling of weapons and drugs across the region; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as well as countering piracy and terrorism whilst protecting the vital sea lines of communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider how things might have developed had we not, over the last 30 years, been in the position to - by building partnerships and understanding the environment - shape and influence events in the region. To deter, contain and ultimately engage in decisive combat operations against our foe while supporting our friends - all in order to assist the delivery of UK national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of our being there, and our wide utility, gave the UK choice in peace-time, and options in crisis. It continues to do so now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider these other examples:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the operation to evacuate British nationals by sea from Lebanon during the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict in 2006; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, last year, from Benghazi; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the response to Hurricane Irene in the Caribbean last Autumn; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the ongoing counter-piracy mission in the Indian Ocean and off the coast of Somalia; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the interception of drugs in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic bound for British streets; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the protection of our fish stocks; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and the conventional defence of the South Atlantic Islands and their associated resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these are examples of forces being employed flexibly. Not fighting wars, but ‘influencing without embroilment’, being there doing their business in order that Defence contributes, in that harmonious counterpoint with all the levers of national power and other actors, to deliver security for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All are examples of this more elaborate application of both soft and hard power - they are, if you will, the epitome of ‘Smart Power’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, as Colin Gray observes, “the…greatest value of the Navy will be found in events that fail to occur because of its influence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which at a time when value for money is uppermost in our minds, the small marginal cost of operating ships with their organic aircraft and submarines at sea, rather than being garrisoned in naval bases, is an attractive benefit of maritime forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Conclusion]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To briefly conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age of austerity, working more closely with other nations remains paramount. Collective Defence is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is introducing greater flexibility in our thinking. Thinking that will truly galvanise government, the military, NGOs and business. Thinking smarter to deliver a more networked and more nuanced response in our future security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in our complex and unpredictable world, maximising the utility and employment of our forces - especially in terms of ‘upstream prevention’ - offers a real opportunity to be smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Prime Minister has put it, “this country has always been at its best when it projects its influence”. It will not surprise you that I consider maritime power to be a compelling expression of this country’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, ladies and gentlemen, means being at sea and being ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening and I look forward to your questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2012/05/15 - 11th International Naval Engineering Conference 2012</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning ladies and gentlemen. And thank you John for your introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you will be familiar with entering Farnborough train station near London, where it says on the platform “Welcome to Farnborough - The home of innovation”. Well, I’m delighted that we are here in Edinburgh for this Conference, for the Forth Rail Bridge, the inventor of the telephone, and now the Aircraft Carriers in build near by, very much make this “the home of the engineer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I - as the UK’s maritime advisor for defence and security - want to give you a sense of what I believe our shared future security environment will look like and some of the shared implications. Particularly, of course, for you here at this Conference, focussed on engineering for the maritime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Future security environment - Uncertainty]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What form will our future global security environment take? An environment that is - as it always has been - dynamic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one that is complex;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one that is multi-dimensional;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and one that is uncertain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will - I would suggest - be an environment in which wealth and opportunity will increasingly be in the hands of the minority. Less equitably distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An environment in which competition for scarce resources will intensify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An environment which - largely because the conveyor belts of globalisation are accelerating us closer together - will lead to nation states’ economic, political and security interests being affected, both more rapidly and more unpredictably by world events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, who would have anticipated the sweep of insecurity across the Maghreb and Levant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that the global economic crisis would acquire such a depth and breadth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And reflect too, for a moment, upon the range of world events over the last 12 months that illustrate the kaleidoscope of our global security environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the crisis in Libya,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the massacre in Norway,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;famine and piracy around the Horn of Africa,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the earthquake in Turkey last October,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the internal unrest in Syria,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the rise in the flow of narcotics from Latin America,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and the Iranian nuclear challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s little wonder that - together with a number of other countries - the UK’s National Security Strategy concludes that, “the risk picture is likely to become increasingly diverse”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this common strategic context, as well as our shared experiences of fiscal restraint - necessarily placing difficult demands at our Defence Department doors - it strikes me that, like it or not, we are all sailing through the same strategic storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Dawn of Maritime Era - Certainty]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, amidst such a climate of uncertainty, there is I believe one thing about which we can be certain - the approaching dawn of a maritime era. Why do I say that? Why do I believe that we are entering an era of re-emerging maritime importance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason is economic. Our sea, our global commons, is a cradle for resources. It fuels us and it feeds us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our sea is the oil that lubricates the global economic engine. Over a third of global GDP is currently moved by sea. And rising by 2.5% every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this increasing economic dependence upon the sea - not just by coastal states but land locked countries too - it means that a nation’s ability to control or deny access to the sea is, even more so than before, a security issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think we are witnessing an “economisation of international security affairs” - and to which there is a strong maritime dimension. The Arabian Gulf, the South China Seas dispute and, increasingly, the High North (by which I mean ‘the Arctic’) are all examples of where resource and access from the sea are driving security agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other reason why I believe the maritime will become increasingly important in the years ahead, is because the largely ungoverned space of our global commons is a security issue itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ungoverned space which, if unchecked, will become a vector for global security threats like piracy, international maritime terrorism, human trafficking, and potential conflicts over energy security and resource depletion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which are de-stabilising influences with the potential to descend into conflict. And, in turn, with disastrous consequences for global trade and international and domestic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some ‘continental’ commentators who ask “so what?” Frankly, from my perspective, as sure as the wind blows from high to low pressure, so the high pressure of future insecurity will fill the low pressure of our largely ungoverned global commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let me be clear. Having said all this, I would not wish you to think that I regard the defence of our shores no longer important. Of course navies must be ready to safeguard their nations’ shorelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, what I am saying is that - given the threats, opportunities and interests that are likely to emerge in the maritime domain - there is little doubt in my mind that it will be our international straits and our oceans that will occupy our attention most in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, ladies and gentlemen, is not a view that I and the UK have reached alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has only to glance at, for example, the outcomes of China’s, Australia’s, Japan’s and India’s Defence Reviews. And testimonies from the US Chiefs - and not just the Chief of Naval Operations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between them, I think, the common theme in the years ahead is one of ‘looking seaward’. And as some of you here will be aware, from my dialogue with my opposite numbers in your nations over the last year, we all recognise that theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, against such a strategic backdrop, I think those of us in the international naval community are presented with two enduring principal roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we must ensure that confidence in using the maritime environment, to conduct trade and harness resources, remains high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And second, when threats to the nation state need to be dealt with at range, we must continue to be able to use the maritime environment to project power to reassure and ultimately protect our national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Implications for Navies]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean for navies and for engineers? Let me consider navies first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways it means we need to continue doing exactly what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing maritime security in key choke points and areas of interest around the world. Keeping our seas safe just as we would wish our streets to be kept safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But equally I take the view that, if we really are entering an era of re-emerging maritime importance, then it has two particular implications for navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that &lt;strong&gt;navies will need to be deployed&lt;/strong&gt; navies. Providing forward presence. Doing so will allow us to deliver maritime power - effect from the sea - with the greatest expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by maintaining confidence in sea trade;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by building trust with an ever-widening circle of international partners;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by bringing hope to fragile states;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by preventing the consequences of illegal activity reaching our shores;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and by deterring potential aggressors from challenging our national interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in this way that - as some might have heard me mention here in Edinburgh recently and elsewhere - we can most effectively leverage events ashore through what I have termed “engagement without embroilment”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the bottom line is this, in an era of re-emerging maritime importance, navies need to be at sea because the more one deploys, the less one needs to be kinetic. So, in my view, this means platforms need to be resilient - low in maintenance, high in availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means that ships need to be agile and have a breadth of capability - from humanitarian assistance to high-end war fighting. For if you are going to be forward deployed, it makes sense to have the capabilities to respond across the spectrum of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second implication for navies is that collective defence will need to be at an &lt;strong&gt;entirely different level of collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most - if not all - of us would agree that “collective defence is the only practical response to the world we live in.” Something that the UK Secretary of State for Defence has said on a number of occasions, including to the Atlantic Council at the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in an emerging maritime era, which would witness an increase in the demand for maritime power, we will need to ask ourselves, not just “what can our navy do for our country?” but “what can our navy do for our collective defence?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subtle yet crucial change of emphasis. And a change of emphasis that will place upon us an even greater need for interoperability with all our allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many nations represented here contributed to the 16-nation maritime element of NATO’s Operation Unified Protector off Libya last year. And many nations here are already contributing to the 25-nation Combined Maritime Force in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if navies are to build upon this, then operating together effectively will be enhanced by procuring together collaboratively. A central theme in the UK’s recent White Paper entitled “National Security Through Technology”. Hence our commitment to bilateral and multilateral programmes - with the US and France, and indeed NATO and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Implications for Engineers]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are the implications for the international naval engineering community? - for many of you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, your engineering judgement will continue to be tested as you strive to find the right balance between, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high-tech and high-maintenance;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;between being safe to our selves and lethal to our enemies;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and between the short term need and the long term desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are two implications which, in my view, will characterise your work most in the years ahead. The two that represent, arguably, the greatest challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is concerned with &lt;strong&gt;adaptability to change&lt;/strong&gt;. Something that Darwin, an alumnus of Edinburgh University, recognised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptability to change - to evolve - not just in terms of ensuring a dexterity in our organisational decision-making, nor simply in terms of flexibility in the way we employ our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But adaptability to change in terms of the design of our platforms - ships, submarines, aircraft and landing craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptability to what? To the changing threat environment, to the changing operating environment, and to the emergence of new technologies. New technologies which are, of course, themselves part of the solution - developments in modular design, maritime ISTAR, unmanned systems and platforms etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building in adaptability to such change from the outset is critical. Take the Type 23 Frigate for example. Designed in the 80s and operated from the 90s, it had to change as the world’s security environment changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily an ASW frigate designed to operate in the North Atlantic, its flexible design was exploited quickly as the need for a more general purpose frigate emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite a degree of inherent adaptability, it nevertheless became clear that, as it started operating beyond the North Atlantic, so the keel needed strengthening. Why? In part because of the different wave lengths of other oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whilst modular design in our platforms is increasingly attractive - as it embodies adaptability into the platform - the example of the Type 23 is a fundamental one if we are to ensure that our future platforms are able to operate, in years to come, in say the Arctic ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such flexibility doesn’t always come cheap. And of course, there’s the rub - to which an age of austerity potentially brings further friction. So I think the challenge is to be innovative in a way that preserves platform adaptability without increasing through-life cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s another reason for thinking innovatively of course. It allows us to, as the UK Chief of Defence Staff has put it, and I quote, “maintain the intellectual flame to adapt to new technologies even though we may be unable to acquire them immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we all need to recruit, and retain, high-quality people (operators and engineers) who are able to think outside the box and keep the intellectual flame burning brightly. Ultimately, we need leaders and innovators more than ever if we are to, with a shorter fiscal vaulting pole, still get over the high bar of ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the second implication and the second challenge - &lt;strong&gt;value for money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a significant driver for every organisation, especially in the current global economic climate. But our necessary and laudable pursuit of efficiency must not be at the expense of the very operational effectiveness that we seek to enhance. Finding the optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness is therefore vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying Physics as I did at University, I think there is a risk that this balance between efficiency and effectiveness could begin to behave less according to Newton’s First Law and more according to Boyle’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;350 years ago, Robert Boyle stated that: “For a fixed amount of gas kept at a fixed temperature, pressure and volume are inversely proportional”. While one doubles, the other halves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the challenge is this. As efficiency and effectiveness become evermore finely balanced, so we need to ensure that we don’t find ourselves in a position where increasing efficiency, decreases effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here again, I believe science, technological innovation and engineering skill can all contribute significantly in the solution space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Conclusion]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, as I draw to a close, I think the uncertain nature of our future security environment means that the naval engineering community needs to understand the nuance of that environment more fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because in a world of such complexity, no single organisation has all the answers. And because, in a world of such unpredictability, there is no single owner of the crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s beholden upon us all to recognise that we have a shared responsibility to understand our future security environment. So that, ultimately, by making better sense of it we shall design platforms that help navies better shape it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, despite the current global economic climate of constraint, we must ensure that - as we sweep our sights across the horizon of future security - we retain the ability to think with imagination and ambition. For it is ambition that fuels change, fuels progress and - in the business of Defence - fuels military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
