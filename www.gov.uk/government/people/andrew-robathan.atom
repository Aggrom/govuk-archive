    <title>2011/12/01 - MoD Civilian Apprentice Awards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Bernard [Gray - Chief of Defence Materiel] for that introduction, and for inviting me to say a few words before presenting this year’s MoD civilian apprentice awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me also thank all of today’s sponsors for their continued support of this important event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly delighted that Lady Cardwell could be with us once again - after last year’s snow prevented her attendance for the first time since 1982 - to present the Sir David Cardwell Memorial Prize.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir David was one of Bernard’s predecessors - in charge of buying the equipment our Armed Forces need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the organisation has changed greatly since Sir David’s time in charge, some things endure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeships continue play an important role in helping us to produce the engineers and craftsmen of the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 500 apprenticeships and 300 advanced apprenticeships were completed last year; we’re here today to recognise the best of them - 29 in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the value of apprenticeships to our Armed Forces and our broader economic well-being is as high as ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, in the modern age, the work of the engineer and the craftsman is not as revered as it should be in the eyes of the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many students are lured away from inventing the future and making things people can actually use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet heavy industry generates more cash, more exports, more technology, and more jobs than many of the more fashionable sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want engineers and craftsmen to be the wonder of our age as they were in the Britain of Telford and Brunel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An architect may have designed London’s latest landmark - the Shard - but it takes engineers and craftsmen to build it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also takes excellence, and in a range of fields. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the practical engineering skills which Brunel would admire, today’s engineers need other skills like project management in their toolbox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our prize-winners today have shown they have the tools to meet the demands of modern engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why they have a great deal to offer to our Armed Forces and to our economy; and I want to reflect briefly on that this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this isn’t some abstract debate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men and women in our Armed Forces - particularly those on operations - rely on the quality of the equipment and support we can provide them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, soldiers in Afghanistan rely on their vehicles to carry out their mission as well as keep them safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything breaks down it can be a life-threatening situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes the job of today’s engineers and craftsmen a vital one, though they don’t always get the credit they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the engineers of the future are not born; they’re made, and they’re nurtured. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeships play such an important role in that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the MoD continues to value and support apprenticeships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our scheme remains an enviable one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a unique opportunity to work on some of the country’s most advanced engineering and equipment projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from our perspective, it’s a shrewd investment in our future workforce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the work on the new aircraft carriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an apprentice supporting the MoD project team, while others are embedded with industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this colossal project has reinvigorated industry apprenticeship schemes across the six shipyards engaged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 800 apprentices are currently involved, and this number is set to increase as production continues to ramp up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever they’re working, these apprentices are proud to learn their trade on such a prestigious project which will be at the heart of Britain’s defence for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we want everyone who undertakes an apprenticeship provided by us to stay with us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that some will go on to use their skills elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in good times, we should welcome the contribution they will make to the broader economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s particularly welcome in tough economic times like these. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t defer investing in our future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a false economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing now in the skills we will need in the future is a key part of our plan for recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is as true for us in the public sector as it is for those in the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want a skills system where responsibility is shared between government, employers, and employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we want to address the problem of youth unemployment so that young people are earning or learning again before long-term damage is done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we launched a £1 billion Youth Contract last week which will provide over 400,000 new work places for 18 to 24 year olds over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeships are at the heart of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, we want to double the incentive payments to encourage employers to take on young apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good news for young people up and down the country, and good news for the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pay-off for business is a skilled, motivated, and loyal workforce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m proud to be the MoD’s apprentice champion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more engineers and craftsmen like you - you are becoming a rare breed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are vital to the Defence of this country, and central to its future prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m delighted that we can recognise your achievements with your friends and family today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/11/01 - Local Government Association Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Sir Merrick for that introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My congratulations on organising a fascinating day with some excellent speakers - they’re still to come..! -and workshops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a Councillor myself, and my wife is currently - within Westminster - so I have some understanding of the issues you face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fantastic to see so many representatives from across local government, and the voluntary and charitable sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are in the vanguard of our plans to cement the bond between our communities and the Armed Forces through the Armed Forces Covenant and Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone down the years would have embraced such localism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General de Gaulle once observed of France, “How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would have really struggled in Britain which - according to the gloriously named British Cheese Board - boasts over 700 distinct local cheeses! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he would have despaired at your job, Merrick, representing as you do hundreds of councils and thousands of councillors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, in part, De Gaulle’s complaint seems to have been that localism interferes with the smooth pursuit of the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps so in France, but in Britain I’ve always believed that’s the wrong way round. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Government believes in ‘small government’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course Westminster and Whitehall should lead on those issues which are truly national in scope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, at most, they should complement - not substitute - local efforts on everything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why decentralising power is at the heart of this government’s agenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Britain’s Armed Forces straddle the national and local divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one level, they are rooted in lock communities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the British infantry system of county regiments helped to forge deep ties between those who serve - often alongside neighbours and friends - and the communities they left behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At another level, our Armed Forces are woven into the fabric of our nation’s history and psyche. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson on the quarterdeck; the Pals on the Somme; the SAS on TV as they stormed the Iranian Embassy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courage, sacrifice, excellence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why the British public have a deep respect for, and pride in, our Armed Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But respect and pride are not the same as understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Armed Forces Community may be an integral part of our society, but in recent decades the link has declined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When World War II ended in 1945, there were around five million men and women in uniform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone in the country knew someone close who had served. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents and her generation gave up their youth in the service of this country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Service generation only added to the ledger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for many years, our Armed Forces have been a professional, volunteer force - declining in number - while the older generations have dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public understanding of our Armed Forces has declined as a result.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters hugely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of our Armed Forces depends on them knowing that they have their country’s support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliament has taken to welcoming home units of the Armed Forces, and yesterday we welcomed 3 Commando. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked them to go to war, and it is right that we welcome them home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such support requires the public to understand the role of our Armed Forces, and the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make with their families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should never take public support for granted, even in times of plenty.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor should we under-estimate their principled conviction that our Armed Forces Community should get the support they need and the dignity they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That they should suffer no disadvantage as a result of serving; indeed should receive special consideration in some instances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that they have a right to expect a whole of society approach - not just a top-down, or bottom-up one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m pleased to say that in the 18 months since the General Election we’ve taken action over a very broad canvas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, the principles I have mentioned (no disadvantage) will be recognised in the law of the land through the Armed Forces Bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the front line, we’ve doubled the operational allowance and extended it to Libya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve improved the Rest and Recuperation leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve doubled Council Tax relief from 25% to 50% for all personnel on operations, including Libya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, we set out - in the ‘Today and Tomorrow’ paper - what we’re doing to give the Covenant practical effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, we have endorsed all of Andrew Murrison’s recommendations for improving mental health care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have allocated resources for 36,000 Service children as part of the pupil premium, and introduced a separate fund for schools with high proportions of Service children.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are giving our personnel a high priority in Affordable Housing Schemes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as I’ve said, the Armed Forces Covenant is not just about action from the centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are fewer than 200,000 serving members of our Armed Forces, whereas there are still more than four and a half million people who have served. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their families, our Armed Forces Community is roughly one in six of the total population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing support to this vast number of people involves all areas of local government working with communities up and down the land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10 NHS Armed Forces Networks have proved particularly useful in ironing out local healthcare and adult social care issues through their extensive local networks.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an RAF couple were devastated to hear that their application to adopt a child had been scuppered by orders posting them overseas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Local Authority had withdrawn from the process as ‘suitable’ counselling services would not be available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contacting their regional Armed Forces Network lead, they were able to get SSAFA Forces Help to liaise with the Local Authority until the issue was resolved and the adoption went ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ‘no disadvantage from service’ principle in action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also shows the importance of local authorities forging links with Service charities and the wider voluntary and charitable sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in June, four counties became the first in Britain to demonstrate community-led support for the Armed Forces through the Community Covenant scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll hear more about best practice later this morning from three of the counties involved so far - Oxfordshire, Hampshire, and North Yorkshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further seven councils have signed, with over 30 in the pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Community Covenant has been well-received, and my hope is that every community will sign one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important as a symbol of our beliefs, and it’s important as a commitment to action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon you will hear more about the Community Covenant Grant Scheme.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have allocated up to £30 million until 2015 to fund projects which support the aims of the Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A panel considered the first bids last month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to announce that we have approved 11 superb bids in full, and another two in part, totalling over £400,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly pleased to see that those bids will draw in matched funding of over a quarter of a million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the successful bids themselves, they include help towards a new Scout and Guides Headquarters in Bedale; supporting the Dover Diamond Jubilee Tattoo; and helping elderly residents in their village during adverse weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions on another 14 applications will be made once we have received some additional information.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they are all approved, it would take total project funding past £1 million in just this first round. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panels are due to sit again in December and March, and quarterly thereafter - so it’s not too late! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, Defence is a very human endeavour -  and the consequences of Service life are very human too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that today inspires you to deepen the relationship between our Armed Forces and the communities they’re drawn from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that relationship is as important now as it’s ever been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we, as a nation, treat our Armed Forces Community is a litmus test of who we are as a nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m confident that the nation will respond to the challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that it will be driven in part by localism in the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/10/27 - The Confederation of Service Charities (COBSEO) AGM</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Tony [Air Vice-Marshal Tony Stables, Royal Air Force (ret’d), Chairman, COBSEO] for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[As Tony said], it is indeed a privilege to meet here in St. James’s Palace, and we are honoured that the Prince of Wales will be joining us shortly in his new capacity as COBSEO Patron. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that Simon Burns from the Department of Health spoke at last year’s event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ll speak on behalf of the MoD.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, perhaps a Minister from another government department - maybe even a Lib Dem?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shrewd move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sends a clear message that the contract between the nation and the Armed Forces Community goes beyond one Department or one sector of society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COBSEO is at the heart of that contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You represent the best of what the French philosopher, Tocqueville, called “the art of association”, which gives society a “habit and taste for serving others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult for Government to engage in a meaningful way with each of the 180 or so organisations - including some 66 regimental associations - which come under the COBSEO umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of COBSEO, we are able to develop a far greater degree of coherence across government in our approach to all these organisations and the important work they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And COBSEO makes their voice in Government far more powerful as a result. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are also a helpful voice of conciliation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our overriding objective is the same: to dignify, honour, and support our Armed Forces Community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet sometimes the priorities of one organisation do not always mesh with those of another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they overlap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has no role in telling your members what to do; individual organisations, not government, know what’s best for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the Chairman of SSAFA Forces Help, Sir Kevin O’Donoghue has said, “As time goes by, it is natural and right that some organisations merge with others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Poppyscotland and the Royal British Legion have recently merged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t changed the brand of Poppyscotland; the Scottish poppy and Scottish Poppy Appeal remain firmly in place; and the manufacture of poppies continues - as it has for almost 90 years - at Lady Haig’s Poppy Factory in Edinburgh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it has provided is major additional investment, which will mean better services for ex-Service personnel and their families north of the border. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SSAFA Forces Help have taken on the charitable objectives and assets of The Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation which supported Britain’s forces and their families for 156 years.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples like these underscore Sir Kevin’s view, and I know that COBSEO has lent a deft touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that (where appropriate) the voluntary and charitable sector should consolidate, not diverge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t have to mean mergers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, the way forward will lie in better co-operation and collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what matters most is the service and the best way of providing it, not the structures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen that with the Defence Recovery Capability which has taken the way we support our wounded, injured, and sick personnel to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In large part, this is thanks to Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion pooling their resources with the MoD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this partnership represents the single largest charitable contribution to the Armed Forces in British history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Government has a major role to play too, and I’ll come to that in a minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I’ve said before, action from the top, or just from the bottom, is rarely the panacea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glass will only be half-full unless Government, local authorities, the Devolved Administrations, charities, businesses, communities, and individuals come together and maximise the benefit their services can offer the Armed Forces Community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a whole of society approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate that with some specific issues which I know are close to COBSEO’s heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take transition issues.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Service leavers are said to be a particularly vulnerable group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as finding a new job, they may often have welfare, housing, education, healthcare, and psychological needs which have to be addressed simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many organisations out there willing and able to help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently visited one of the smaller COBSEO members - the recently renamed Stoll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The housing and support they provide for vulnerable and disabled ex-Service personnel - particularly the homeless - is quite simply the Big Society in action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support and advice is provided by the voluntary and charitable sector across the UK so that those who choose to serve their country can look to their country with confidence when they most need help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it can nonetheless be daunting for those who need help to know where to turn, and we’re addressing this issue through the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency hotline and website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But COBSEO has also helped enormously as people can now look at their website and their inaugural ‘handbook’ to find out who does what. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COBSEO is also running a transition system for early Service leavers to trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’ve set up a number of cluster groups within COBSEO to look at specific issues such as residential and care homes; criminal justice support; and welfare delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, through the “Forces in Mind” trust, COBSEO is leading a partnership of Service charities and mental health organisations seeking Big Lottery funding to support the psychological well-being and successful transition of Service leavers and their families into civilian life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll know if they’ve been successful shortly, and I wish them every success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I would come back to the Government’s role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some areas where the MoD is firmly in the lead within government - the operational allowance to the Veterans’ helpline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my colleagues across Whitehall recognise the role they have too.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has developed a Transition Protocol with the Department of Health, Devolved Administrations, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition for the most seriously ill and injured Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Prime Minister announced investment in the NHS of up to £15 million to improve the prosthetics services for ex-Service personnel who have lost a limb due to activities while serving their country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also much more going on as part of our wider work on the Armed Forces Covenant and Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, for example, we shall be announcing the first tranche of grant funding for projects which support the aims of the Community Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other areas, we work together, taking the lead or complementing the efforts of your members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must work together, but we must also talk to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value the input of the independent members of the Covenant Reference Group, of which COBSEO is a member along with TRBL, SSAFA Forces Help, the War Widows Association, the three Family Federations, and Professor Hew Strachan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a particularly important contribution as we prepare the new Annual Report on the Covenant, as required by the Armed Forces Bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, we all know that times are tough.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet such is the respect in which our Armed Forces are held that the public continues to support so many service charities to re-pay the debt of honour we all owe those who serve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that COBSEO will be in the vanguard of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/09/19 - Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation AGM</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Sir John [Field Marshal Sir John Chapple, President, Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation] for that introduction, and for inviting me to join your AGM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The housing and support which the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation provides for vulnerable and disabled veterans - particularly the homeless - is quite simply the Big Society in action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s replicated across the charitable and voluntary sector so that those who choose to serve their country can look to their country with confidence when they most need help.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer breadth and depth of this effort never ceases to amaze me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent example is Pryors Bank Cafe, here in Fulham, which, as you know, is a not-for-profit business run in partnership with the Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was founded by a former soldier, which to my mind gave it a fighting chance from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It trains former Service personnel to NVQ standard with the chance of working in West End Restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it pays people a wage, gives them a chance to study at college, and assists them in finding accommodation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when your Chief Executive invited me to see for myself the terrific work the Foundation does, I was only too happy to oblige. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good opportunity for me to set your work in the broader context of Government policy towards serving and former Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are testing times for the country - and Defence is no exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Government seeks to put the public finances back on a sustainable path, we in Defence are doing the same for a Defence budget which has been in disarray for some time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also seeking to transform our Armed Forces so that they are fit for the 21st century and the demands which living in this century will place on our Servicemen and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no denying that there are serious issues to address, and the context in which we will operate will be tough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has had to make some difficult, painful, but necessary decisions to get the Defence budget broadly back towards balance, and further tough decisions lie ahead of us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had to prioritise ruthlessly in order to ensure that any extra money we can spend, we do so wisely, and on those things that are most urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s at times like these that having some guiding principles stands us in good stead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those serving today, we are clear that our priorities are caring for those who are physically and mentally injured in the course of their service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for those who have ever put country before self we are determined that the country as a whole should unite in its determination to provide the very best support possible in return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we have published the first ever Tri-Service Armed Forces Covenant in which these key principles will be recognised, among others, for the first time, in the law of land. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the ‘Today and Tomorrow’ paper, we have set out what we’re doing to give the Covenant practical effect, for example in the areas of Healthcare, Education, and Housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Government has a major role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervention by the charitable and voluntary sector has a long tradition of making an impact - this Foundation alone has been operating since 1917. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But action just from the top, or just from the bottom, is rarely the panacea.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glass will only be half-full unless Government, local authorities, Devolved Administrations, charities, businesses, communities, and individuals come together and maximise the benefit their services can offer the Defence Community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a whole of society approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, with the Army Recovery Capability, we’ve seen the way we support our wounded, injured, and sick personnel taken to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In large part, that’s thanks to the MoD, Help for Heroes, and the Royal British Legion pooling their resources in a common aim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the MoD has developed a Transition Protocol with the Department of Health, Devolved Administrations, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition for the most seriously ill and injured Service personnel.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new Big White Wall on-line support network to support the mental health needs of the Armed Forces community is another example excellent example of a whole of society approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is clearly still more to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Housing the homeless is the subject most dear to your hearts, so let me say a few words about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Prime Minister has said, “It is an affront to this country that last winter, one of the coldest on record, there were people still sleeping rough on our streets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, some of those on the streets in that bitter winter cold were former Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may have been affected by their experiences of active service; others by what happened to them before or since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other Departments have the lead role, we in the MoD have an ongoing duty of care to those who serve our nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are leaving no stone unturned to see if there are preventative measures we can take in-Service to minimise the impact on our people when they leave.  I mentioned the Transition Protocol just now, but there are other initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we intend to consult on how the Armed Forces are managed on social housing lists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And current and former members of the Armed Forces will be put at the front of the queue for the new FirstBuy scheme, and other Government initiatives to support first time buyers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Service in our Armed Forces is not a pre-requisite for homelessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the Ministerial level, we’re taking a broad approach to homelessness through the inter-Ministerial Working Group on homeless issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, we published a cross-Government report called, ‘Vision To End Rough Sleeping: No Second Night Out Nationwide’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to tackle the complex causes of homelessness - not only housing, but family breakdown and mental health; drug addiction and alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s about partnership at all levels with the ultimate aim of helping the homeless along the path to full independent living. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Government can only do so much; the whole of society must play its part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s here that the excellent work of the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation really comes into its own, and you should be proud of the high-regard in which you are held by the ex-Service community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest figures show a reduction in rough sleeping by ex-Service personnel in London, and your hard work has undoubtedly played a major part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish you the best with your Veterans Nomination Scheme which dovetails neatly with the Covenant and the Big Society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also pay tribute to other initiatives such as ‘The Beacon’ near Catterick Garrison which offers 31 flats to homeless veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, these projects would not have been possible without effective partnership at all levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So despite the tough times we are going through, there are reasons to be cheerful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Brigadier Ricketts of Veterans Aid said recently, “I’m still firmly of the opinion that if you are in crisis in Britain today, you are lucky if you are a veteran. There is a huge military family that will reach out to you in your hour of need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s more than that: there is a grateful society at large to turn to as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the forefront of that effort - as it has been for almost a century - is the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are further proof that compassion for those who serve on our behalf remains at the heart of who we are as a nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/09/01 - MOD Welfare conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add my thanks to all of you who have come and all the organisations represented here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In difficult times it is especially important than we come together to discuss policy, to swap ideas, to share concerns, to suggest solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because this is a testing time for the country - and for Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="testing-times"&gt;Testing Times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A time of austerity - as the Government seeks to put the public finances back on a sustainable path - and seeks to do the same for a Defence budget that has been in disarray for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a time of change - as we seek to transform our Armed Forces for the rigours of modern warfare - and for the rigours of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times like this the men and women of our Armed Forces need people like you - not only to support them, but to speak up for them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I know that this conference is not going to be all sweetness and light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are serious issues to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the next few years the context in which we will operate will be tough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government has had to make some difficult, very painful but necessary decisions to get the Defence budget broadly back towards balance and further tough decisions lie ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has meant that we have had to prioritise ruthlessly in order to ensure that any extra money we can spend, we do so wisely and on those things that are most urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="operational-welfare"&gt;Operational Welfare&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations have to come first - making sure that those in the firing line have the tools and protection they need to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has not been just about strategy and equipment, but about making sure they and their families are looked after too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Montgomery set out in his principles of warfare - ‘the morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why on the welfare side we doubled the Operational Allowance and extended it to Libya, and improved Rest and Recuperation leave and increased compensation for those who suffer both physical and mental injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we have doubled Council Tax relief from 25% to 50%, for all personnel on operations, including in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus of operations has meant that in other areas we haven’t been able to go as far and as fast as we want - for instance on the speed with which we improve housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although 96% of Service Family Accommodation properties are now in the top two standards for condition, and we will continue to target efforts on the most pressing accommodation issues, there will be a three-year pause in the programme to upgrade lower quality SFA homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="action"&gt;Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hope you will agree with me that we have been as consultative as possible and where we have been able to act we have done so in the right areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, we have endorsed all of Andrew Murrison’s proposals for improving mental health care. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A structured mental health component within existing medical examinations performed whilst serving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An uplift in the number of mental health professionals conducting veterans’ outreach work from Mental Health Trusts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trial of an online early intervention service for serving personnel and veterans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The means to allow the newly formed Veterans’ Information Service (VIS) to contact Service leavers after they have left the Armed Forces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, for those who need it at the time of discharge, a specialist opinion and any follow on treatment by the MOD’s Mental Health Service for a period of six months’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have laid the foundations for a new understanding between Armed Forces personnel and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the Service Personnel Command Paper, we have published the first ever tri-service Armed Forces Covenant in which the key principles will be recognised, for the first time, in the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the ‘Today and Tomorrow’ paper we have set out what we’re doing to give the Covenant practical effect, for example in the areas of Healthcare, Education and Housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn’t just about action from the centre or from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be hearing from the Armed Forces Networks later today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These have proved particularly useful in ironing out local level issues between the MOD and the local NHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in June four counties - Oxfordshire, Hampshire, North Yorkshire, and Vale of Glamorgan - became the first in Britain to demonstrate community-led support for the Armed Forces through the Community Covenant scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Oxfordshire alone, more than £100,000 of Council money will be spent in the next 12 months to help people leaving the forces to resettle in the county, topped up with grants from Government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities, Devolved Administrations, charities, businesses, communities, and individuals have come together by offering their services to help the Defence Community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is still a place for central support, for instance, extra Government money for schools which educate pupils from forces’ families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole of society approach has been central to what - together - we have been able to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Army Recovery Capability - a joint venture between the MoD, Help for Heroes, and the Royal British Legion - is taking the way we support our wounded, injured, and sick personnel to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve the transition from Service to civilian life, the MoD has developed a Transition Protocol with the Department of Health, Devolved Administrations, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition for the most seriously ill and injured Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the new, round-the-clock, veterans’ mental health helpline is funded by the NHS and run by Rethink Mental Health on behalf of Combat Stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="challenges"&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, we are determined to be bold and ambitious, and to build formidable, well-managed Armed Forces structured for the rigours of future conflict, supported by an affordable defence programme, and sensitive to the needs of the people who serve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who serve today, and their families, have very different expectations and needs from those of even a generation ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces need to offer a comprehensive package of pay, benefits, education, training, medical support, career progression, and job satisfaction - among other things - to recruit and retain personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they also need to ensure that life in the Forces meets the needs of modern families too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what lies behind our thinking on the New Employment Model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that a large number of Service Personnel and there families would benefit from a more stable lifestyle - everything from schooling the children to buying a home to providing better stability for spouse’s careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear that the Defence budget would benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would enable us to reduce housing stock and relocation costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also allow us to minimise spending on expensive allowances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while stability and predictability will please families, they are hardly the best slogans to put on adverts designed to attract the people we need in tomorrow’s Armed Forces. Many people will still be required to move on a regular basis and support for this must remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balance may be difficult to achieve, and reaching it will present different challenges for each of the 3 Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no panacea, and more work remains to be done - and this is an area in which we need input from you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that we offer flexibility and choice so that a life in the Armed Forces appeals to a broad range of the society from which our people are drawn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, we have much to discuss and much work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that times are tough and we need to be realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may not always agree on what we prioritise, but I know that we all share a passion: to do our very best to support the men and women of our Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/05/25 - British Medical Association (BMA) Armed Forces Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Brendan [Dr. Brendan McKeating, Chairman, BMA Armed Forces Committee] for that kind introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Secretary of State was questioned about the potential for abuse of the Covenant by scurrilous members of the legal profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that he had one sister who is a doctor and one who is a lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His father used to say he had the best of both worlds: one licensed to kill; one licensed to steal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Liam Fox is himself a Doctor and of course a politician.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has therefore the licence not only to kill but to explain why it was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the Defence Medical Services is a hugely important part of my Ministerial brief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made it a priority to meet as many Regular and Reserve DMS members as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my visits to Afghanistan, I have visited Camp Bastion’s Role 3 medical facility - last time, commanded by Colonel Robin Jackson TA, and now by a RN Commander Carole Betteridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may well know, on the office wall at Bastion is a map of Task Force Helmand (South West) with the facility in the middle surrounded by concentric circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each circle shows the distance a Medical Emergency Response Team can cover in a set time to reach a casualty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first boundary is ten minutes - five minutes out, and five back again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And every minute matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you know personally, the Bastion team are doing quite remarkable work in difficult circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I am always very impressed at the sheer breadth of service which DMS members provide - from emergency life-saving procedures on operations to primary care at home and overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also pay tribute to the civilian medical staff who support the Services and their families around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s right to take stock at this conference - of achievements and future challenges.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the MoD Ministerial team I would like to pay tribute to everyone involved - regular, reserve, civilian - for the magnificent job they, you are doing; thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of the next 12 months are likely to be no less testing than the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan remains our number one priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have the challenge of operations elsewhere - not least Libya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I saw on Saturday an RAF doctor working in Italy with the Typhoon/Tornado deployment on ops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we face a major programme of change following the Strategic Defence and Security Review which will transform Defence for 2020 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDSR sets the vision for the Armed Forces we require. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the SDSR will take some time and there are a series of complicated second order consequences including the basing and reserves reviews, as well as the emerging work from the Defence Reform Unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise the uncertainty this places on you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have jobs that are tough, often dangerous, and always vital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to keep you updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to talk about four things which I know are of personal interest to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the vexed issue of pay and allowances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us are tightening our belts, and I won’t pretend it’s pain free, including for the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current financial climate we cannot do as much to honour that obligation, or do it as quickly, as we would like, but where we can act we will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we have doubled the operational allowance - over £5000 tax free for a 6 month deployment; changed the Rest and Recuperation arrangements on operations; and maintained the annual increments for eligible military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Armed Forces Pay Review Body will continue to review recruitment and retention levels of specific professions within the DMS, and where necessary introduce measures to improve conditions or recruitment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obligation we owe to our service men and women, set against the commitment and sacrifice that they make, is enormous.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  Armed Forces Covenant  launched last week recognises  that service personnel should face no disadvantage compared to other citizens in the provision of services and therefore require, in some circumstances, special consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much still to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been clear that the covenant is an evolving issue, not something completed overnight, and I believe that the British people understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has to be a whole of Government effort, linked to what you are doing, what the NHS is doing, and what local government and the charitable sector is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of that is the work the MOD is doing with the Health Department and charities to support Andrew Murrison’s review into the effectiveness of NHS prosthetic services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing I want to talk about is the future shape of the DMS.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admiral Jarvis will say more about this later, but as most of you know we have launched a comprehensive internal review - DMS 20 - to help shape the DMS for the next decade and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordability will be a factor because everything we do has to be anchored in the art of the possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But DMS 20 is primarily about the medical capabilities required to support Defence, and how best these can be delivered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other significant workstrand for the DMS is the independent Future Reserves 20 study - commissioned by the Prime Minister - which is planning to publish its report later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a limit to what I can say without pre-empting its work, but I will say this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continued deployment of significant numbers of DMS Reserves underlines their value to and integration with overall Defence capability.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reserves remain integral to the future of Britain’s Defence as part of the “Whole Force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, mental health - a subject around which I tread very warily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of their service, the men and women of our Armed Forces see things and experience things that push them to the limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will have physical injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will have mental scars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will have both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, good training, understanding leadership, the support of family and the comradeship of those who have been through the same thing can help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But psychological difficulties can be hard to diagnose, and, as you will know better than I, sometimes taking years to surface, often after people have left the forces.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we made tackling mental health issues such a high priority, and why we are putting extra funding aside for better healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why we welcomed Andrew Murrison’s independent study of mental health services for both current and former Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already put two of his recommendations into practice: a free, dedicated 24 hour support line for former and serving personnel and their families - and I have phoned it and can confirm that it works; and 30 additional mental health nurses for former personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, there will be an enhanced mental health assessment for serving personnel during medical examinations -in-Service and prior to discharge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where our personnel do suffer mental health illness they must receive of course proper compensation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’ve nearly trebled the maximum compensation payment for those suffering the most severe mental health problems under the AFCS, and increased the amounts that they are paid for life on leaving the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simply the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, what of the future? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocrates is quoted as saying that ‘war is the only proper school for a surgeon’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the physical and mental toll of war has driven medical practice and innovation forward and refocused research into specific conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work benefits not just those on the front line or in the Armed Forces generally, but civilian patients too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the foundation of the Red Cross in the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino in 1859. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the pioneering work to develop penicillin in the Second World War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast became the world leader in treatment of gun shot wounds during the Troubles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the principles behind the new National Institute of Health Research for Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, the opening of which I attended earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 20,000 people in Britain suffer major trauma each year, and issues like haemorrhage control; resuscitation; and wound management remain challenges for society at large.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIHR will help us continue to develop new techniques to treat our forces fighting in Afghanistan, and allow military surgeons to share rapid advances and surgical innovation in managing severe trauma with the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s collaboration in action for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that puts your Conference in context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military service is never without risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a moral duty to ensure those who suffer in the service of our country are properly cared for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why making sure our people get the right medical support is such a vital component of the Armed Forces Covenant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much to be resolved, but our intent is clear and with your help we will achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2011/02/11 - Army Recovery Capability</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Tom [Colonel Fleetwood, Commander Colchester Garrison] for those kind words of welcome, and for hosting me here today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one year to the day since the launch of the Army Recovery Capability initiative - the ARC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This joint venture - between the MoD, Help for Heroes, and the Royal British Legion - will take the way we treat our wounded, injured and sick personnel to a new level.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve months on, and we have made real progress, which is why I am delighted to be able to ‘cut the turf’ at the first purpose-built Personnel Recovery Centre here at Colchester. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to see that so many of you from the local community could come and see this progress for yourselves, and learn about our future plans for the ARC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your chance to speak to some of the Service personnel who have benefitted from the enhancements and facilities that the ARC has to offer, and the personnel employed to support them; I encourage you to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also delighted to be sharing the platform with the Adjutant General, General Mans, who is making sure that the Army delivers its part of the bargain to make the ARC a success.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He will explain why the ARC is so important and how it works in a little more detail shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s right and proper that Bryn Parry from Help for Heroes and Chris Simpkins from the Royal British Legion are here today too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s event would not have been possible without them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dedication and financial generosity of both charities, combined with the long-term commitment they have made to this initiative, is remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is RBL’s biggest single financial commitment in nearly 90 years, and Help for Heroes - which was only launched in 2007 - have also generated huge support and funding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are extremely grateful for all that they do, and it’s part of our broader commitment to a long-term partnership with the Service charities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said at the outset that the Army Recovery Capability takes the way we treat our wounded, injured and sick personnel to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ARC ensures that that those who need it receive the right level of welfare support and access to key services to allow a successful return to duty; or to make the smoothest transition to an appropriately skilled and supported life outside the Service.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the contribution of our charitable partners, but it is also a multi-million pound commitment by the Ministry of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has committed £35M over four years to ensure the success of this project, and we will be providing the personnel needed to staff the Personnel Recovery Centres - like the one to be built here in Colchester. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience shows that injured personnel find a military environment conducive to the best possible recovery, and the strength of Colchester’s connection with our Armed Forces - historically and today - made it a logical choice to be one of the four centres. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the centres, a key component of the ARC is the Royal British Legion Battle Back Centre.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle Back is a Tri-Service initiative which aims to improve and formalise the use of adventurous training and adaptive sport in the aftercare of wounded, injured and sick Service personnel in order to aid their rehabilitation and return to an active life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already know how much this type of activity can benefit an individual’s recovery, both physically and psychologically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the focus is on what an individual can do, not what they can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBL will establish a Battle Back Centre by the summer which will integrate all Battle Back activity on behalf of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be available to all personnel undergoing recovery from all three services, including mobilised reservists.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as important as the ARC is, it’s just one essential part of the support available to wounded, injured and sick personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our involvement in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted in an increasing number of wounded personnel, some of whom are suffering devastating injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the incredible professionalism and capabilities of the medical support - both in theatre and here at home - our personnel are now surviving those devastating injuries that once would have been life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical care and rehabilitation facilities that are available to our Service personnel are second to none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will ensure that this remains the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way in which we are achieving this is by implementing a Transition Protocol between the MoD, the Department of Health, and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services to ensure a seamless transition from military to civilian life for wounded, injured, and sick Service personnel with ongoing health and/or social needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This protocol was agreed by all stakeholders in September 2010, and is currently being trialled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trial period ends in March, and will then become Tri-Service policy, and firm policy for the other Departments involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, help from charities like RBL and Help for Heroes extends beyond funding the Recovery Centres. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Help for Heroes also provide funding in direct support of Individual Recovery Plans, which are tailored to meet the needs of recovering personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure we’ll here more from Bryn about that shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all these initiatives - the ARC; first-class medical and clinical care; the implementation of the Transition Protocol - are part of our commitment to an Armed Forces Covenant, which will soon set out the moral obligation that this nation has to those who volunteer to defend it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, we owe it to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces to make sure they are fit for life - both physically and mentally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the difficult financial position we find ourselves in, that is what this Government is doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ARC embodies that effort, and today we mark a major milestone in our progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful for the hard work and dedication of all those involved, and I know you will make the ARC a huge success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I’ll hand over to General Mans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2010/12/06 - Armed Forces 2020: Reserves in Transformation Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Michael [Professor Clark, Director, RUSI] for that introduction, and for asking me to open today’s conference on the future of our Reserve forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of June, I gave two speeches to RUSI in the space of the week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long ago that seems: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg adorned every student’s wall;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This on the record so sorry boss: David Cameron was popular with Harrier pilots;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Ed Miliband was looking forward to Christmas with his brother…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things stay the same, however - always a pleasure to be here at RUSI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Royal Highness, Your Grace, Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we published the Strategic Defence and Security Review just over a month ago, the Prime Minister commissioned a six-month review of the Reserve Forces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re calling it the Future Reserves Study 2020, or FR20 for short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is chaired by the Vice Chief, General Sir Nick Houghton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And supported by my friend and colleague, Julian Brazier, MP, who is the Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Reserves and Cadets, and was a TA officer for 13 years; and by Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb - a distinguished career soldier, with whom I was a Troop Commander nearly 30 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am delighted that subject matter experts drawn from across the Defence community have also agreed to support the Study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could not be in better hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there’s a limit to what I can say about FR20 without pre-empting its work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to set the scene for today’s conference by explaining the SDSR context in which FR20 will operate; and the principles that will guide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few months have been unsettling for all of us in Defence, because we knew that change would come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first fundamental re-think in 12 years had to acknowledge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that we are in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in a generation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that we inherited a national debt that was growing at a rate that could fund three Type 45 destroyers per week &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that we also inherited some restrictive but binding, contractual arrangements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;that security and defence are indivisible these days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and that we needed to increase investment in certain priority areas such as cyber security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, we had to reach our conclusions while our Armed Forces are fighting hard in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the fact that the Defence budget is making a more modest contribution to deficit reduction than many other government departments shows the priority across Government that we attach to national security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDSR protects our mission in Afghanistan and provides a template for our future Defence posture and capabilities, but there is still a great deal of work to be done before the detailed picture of what we call our Future Force 2020 emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It includes this fundamental review of the Reserve Forces’ role and structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I spoke here in June, I summed up our approach to the SDSR in three words: relevance, realism, and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also apply these principles in FR20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First - Relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Review of Reserves 2009, led by Major General Nicholas Cottam, focused largely on improvement to existing roles and structures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a valuable piece of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the SDSR was clear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our posture and capabilities must be relevant to the challenges we will face in 2020 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FR20 will build on the proud history and traditions of the Reserves, and the vast operational experience many of them have gained in Iraq and Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its overriding task is to ensure that the Reserves fulfil a meaningful operational role within our Future Force 2020, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, FR20 will explore the role of the Reserves as part of the Whole Force Concept - looking not just at the Regular/Reservist balance, but full gamut of non-Regular manpower, including the roles of contractors and civilians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second principle is Realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordability will always be a constant pressure on Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this Study must be anchored in the art of the possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, we must challenge the view that Reserves are somehow seen as ‘Defence on the Cheap’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are part of the inherent structure of Defence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And employers who release Reservists for duty get an excellent return on their investment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estate issues will also be a key area of FR20, because as you will know, the volunteer estate was already lagging behind structural changes since the last Defence Review in 1998, and needs to be realigned with Future Force 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no decisions have been taken about precisely how the volunteer estate will change, it is likely that the total number of sites will reduce, but will be more suitable for the 21st century tasks required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure that remains must enable, not constrain, the organisation it is supporting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third principle is responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serving in the Reserves must remain attractive, relevant, and beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we must ensure that they are looked after properly during and after service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have another responsibility: to tell the public about the magnificent contribution our Reservists are making - month in, month out; year in, year out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, when Only Fools and Horses was the most popular TV show, the nation instinctively laughed when Marlene told Del Boy that she wasn’t pregnant because: “Boycie fires more blanks than a Territorial!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laughed because Reserves were seen as the modern day equivalent of Dad’s Army: admirable in many ways, but perhaps taken more seriously by themselves than the British public or their Regular counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, time after time our Reserves have come to Britain’s aid - supporting the Regulars.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military chiefs know that Reservists contribute a huge range of skills and capability to the Whole Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They know how dependent operations in Afghanistan are on Reservists - particularly the specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to the Regulars’ credit, the Reservists I’ve spoken to say how well they’ve been looked after and integrated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear - the Reserves remain integral to the future of Britain’s Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, we will seek ideas from across the Services - Regulars and Reservists - and from close friends and allies, think tanks, and international organisations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will consult through direct engagement, seminars, presentations, and focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look at international models, noting the cultural context, and draw any appropriate lessons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will never forget the important place that our Reserves have in society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, I have long admired Dr. Johnson’s observation that “Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea” - and I of course extend that to airmen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s often forgotten that, in both World Wars, it was the Reserves who filled the gap and saved the day after the Regulars were hit hard in early battles.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re on the frontline again, in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not the ‘weekend warriors’ of popular myth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a special kind of person to volunteer to serve in the Reserves - balancing the demands of 21st century civilian life with the demands of 21st century warfare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They bring incredible skills, experience, and capabilities to the Defence of the Realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they do so willingly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must maximise their talents in a structure that serves the nation as well as our Reservists have always done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s event is a chance to be bold and innovative, to challenge assumptions, and to think at a strategic level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing your views - now and in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2010/11/10 - Royal Society of Medicine</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you David [Misselbrook, RSM Academic Dean] for those kinds words of introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be here this morning for three reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it’s an honour to address such a distinguished medical audience at the world-renowned Royal Society of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, this conference is particularly timely, coming hot on the heels of our Strategic Defence and Security Review - the SDSR -and the report on mental health by my friend and Parliamentary colleague, Dr. Andrew Murrison - which you may have read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thirdly, tomorrow is Armistice Day and I have the honour of attending a lunch for the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They, too, have asked me to say a few words, and in my research I discovered that only three people have ever won the Victoria Cross twice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, the VC is the ultimate award for valour in the face of the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of these three were doctors in the Royal Army Medical Corps: Surgeon Captain Arthur Martin-Leake during the Boer War and the First World War; and Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse who won both of his on the Western Front during World War I. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their actions saved the lives of others who would have died without their total lack of regard for their own safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this evening you will be marking the sacrifice of many members of your profession on battlefields around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s their example which reminds us all why we are here today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first six months as a Defence Minister, I’ve met a great many of our Servicemen and women, both here in Britain and on deployments overseas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has included meeting members of the Defence Medical Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am full of admiration for the professional and compassionate manner in which both Regular and Reserve DMS members carry out their duties, around the clock, and, in extremis, under enemy fire.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw that for myself two weeks ago when I visited Camp Bastion’s Role 3 medical facility, commanded by Colonel Robin Jackson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are doing quite remarkable work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also pay tribute to the civilian medical staff who support the Services and their families in Britain and overseas - indeed, given the earlier career of Dr Fox, the Secretary of State, for whom I work, who was a GP, it would be remiss of me not to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a former Servicemen, I appreciate the tremendous progress that has been made since my time as a serving officer along the whole medical chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History shows that armed conflict can lead to remarkable advances in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the tragedy of war comes some good - the world-leading gunshot specialists at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like their predecessors, this generation of medical staff has introduced new clinical doctrine, practices, and procedures to guarantee the highest standards of care on operations, as we can see in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have shown themselves to be imaginative and bold, continually monitoring and adjusting their ever-improving care according to the results they achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our forces are reassured that they have a better chance of surviving a traumatic injury sustained in-theatre than they would given the same injury in a road traffic accident in Birmingham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive impact which this has on the Moral Component of fighting power is a particularly powerful support to commanders and the forces themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But military service is never without risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As General Sir Rupert Smith once remarked, “the one certainty of contact with an enemy is the generation of casualties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see the wounded, at varying stages of what is for some an incredibly long, demanding, and challenging process, I cannot fail to be impressed by their remarkable spirit and their black Service humour! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, at Headley Court I heard of a man admiring a double amputee’s sports car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter responded by saying: “It’ll cost you an arm and a leg!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of their families, reacting to potentially life-changing events, as they support the wounded member of their family on the road to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a nation, we owe a particular debt of gratitude to the casualties of war. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why the way in which we treat our wounded must be a top priority and a moral obligation for any country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the difficult financial circumstances surrounding the SDSR, we’ve been clear that when it comes to our people our focus will be care for the injured and for their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we will maintain and further develop the medical support and social care provided by DMS and the NHS, which will include properly planned and supported transition from military to civilian life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve announced an extra £20 million per year for better healthcare, specifically for additional medical staff, and to deliver better mental healthcare facilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned at the beginning, we also welcome Andrew Murrison’s Report on mental health - MP for Westbury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly endorse its key themes and recommendations, and will be working on them as quickly as possible, working hand-in-glove with the Department of Health and all concerned, including voluntary and charitable organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re already putting two of his recommendations into practice: a free, dedicated 24 hour support line for former service personnel; and 30 additional mental health nurses in Mental Health Trusts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We owe it to those with mental scars to identify them far sooner, and we are examining various ways to do so, including trialling screening and surveillance techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, that’s why the Department of Health and the Scottish and Welsh Administrations - with our support - have undertaken community mental health pilots at six NHS Trusts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are evaluating these schemes which will help with the provision of mental health services from next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are developing an overarching Armed Forces Mental Health Strategy, as well as a Stress Management Training Centre at the Defence Academy in Shrivenham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to see that your programme today will touch on some these longer term aspects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I mentioned the impact that war has on medical advances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMS are achieving a standard of care and outcomes that are simply unprecedented, particularly in the area of trauma care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have made changes throughout - from the moment someone is wounded; through the celebrated ‘MERT’ helicopter retrieval of casualties; the Field Hospitals; and the Aeromedical Evacaution service back home; to the new NHS Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you will also hear a good deal about these changes, as well as hearing about the challenges facing our Permanent Joint Headquarters in ensuring optimum medical support many thousands of miles away from home base. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe that there is an obligation on us all to ensure that the skills that have been developed are shared and transferred across the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of the lessons learned by the combined NHS and military teams in Birmingham, and the remarkable work carried out by the staff at Headley Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that today’s conference will help that process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope that puts your Conference today in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say we will treat the invisible as well as visible scars of war, we mean it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we couldn’t do it without you, the professionals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the brave men and women you work so hard to support, you have our gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>2010/09/21 - MoD Welfare Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you Lieutenant General Rollo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen, and welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to be here and will be back at the end of the day to answer questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year since the last MoD Welfare Conference has been one of considerable change, not least a different Government and a different Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further difference is that we’re on the verge of the most significant period for Britain’s Defence in a generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence needs, regrettably, to play its part in dealing with a deficit that this country can no longer sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, the debt interest bill alone will be over £46 billion - more than the entire Defence budget for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence programme out to 2020 is over-committed by some £38 billion - a sum that neither the Department nor the Government can fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is additional to any requirement to cut budgets beyond that in order to address the UK’s extraordinarily large structural deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everyone here is aware of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time we are conducting a Strategic Defence and Security Review to ensure that our Armed Forces are able to meet a range of challenges today and prepare for a range of challenges that we may face in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whatever we want to do, everyone here has to understand that this will not be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Prime Minister’s mandate is clear: we want to create an atmosphere in which we, as a nation, “back, revere, and support the military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in June, I gave a speech at RUSI which set out some of the principles that would underpin our approach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to return to five of those principles and take stock of our progress to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this government has pledged to treat Service personnel, their families, and former Service personnel with fairness and dignity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces Covenant will be the foundation of how the nation treats the Armed Forces Community, and will guide policy across government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a couple of simple examples: looking at the voting rules for Service personnel; and looking at a Pupil Premium for Service children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But specific commitments like these are just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer, a Covenant Taskforce was asked to trawl for innovative ways to make the Armed Forces Covenant a reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am most grateful to Professor Strachan, who is speaking later today, for all his work chairing this Taskforce over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recently provided his findings to the External Reference Group for consideration, and the final report will be sent to the Prime Minister shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if our number one priority is operations - as it is - it follows that Operational Welfare should be one of our top priorities also.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve made excellent progress; let me give you two easy examples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have doubled the Operational Allowance, backdated to May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have made changes to the Rest and Recuperation arrangements for Afghanistan, and indeed any subsequent operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future, no Servicemen and women serving tours in Afghanistan (and on other qualifying deployed operations) will lose out on their two weeks’ rest and recuperation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future, personnel will receive additional post operational leave where, for instance, flights home are delayed or circumstances dictate they cannot take all their R&amp;amp;R during their tour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it is everyone’s responsibility to assist members of the Armed Forces with the issues they face as they transition to civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, Care Planning for the ill and injured, and particularly the Transition Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Service personnel leave the Armed Forces, the responsibility for all aspects of their care and support transfers to the NHS and local authorities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take our responsibilities for this transition seriously to ensure that the care and support is seamless during the handover, and that those who will be supporting our people are fully prepared for them from day one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have agreed the process for managing the transition for those leaving the Services owing to illnesses or injury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing so, we shall have a more effective handover of care responsibilities from the MoD to local service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This protocol is currently being piloted with the aim of being fully integrated by summer of next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the Department of Health, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, and their colleagues in the Devolved Administrations for their help.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also continue to pilot the Welfare Pathway with several local authorities across the UK so that members of the Armed Forces can get even easier access to the full range of services we all provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we expect to take final decisions on this in a year’s time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I think ‘Welfare Pathway’ is a rather dreadful term; so if anyone can come up with anything better, I’d be delighted to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, we have said that we will deal with the invisible wounds of war as well as the visible ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On mental health, the government is clear that extra support will be provided to those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister asked Dr. Andrew Murrison - MP for Westbury - to look at the relationship between the NHS and the Armed Forces community, and to pay particular attention to the mental health of former service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings are expected to be announced shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also developing an overarching Armed Forces Mental Health Plan, which will tell us how the mental health of Service personnel is managed across their careers, which will help to identify where the gaps are, and what needs to be done to plug them, and by whom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April next year, there will be a Joint Stress Management Training Centre at the Defence Academy in Shrivenham to co-ordinate the delivery of stress management training to Front Line Commanders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also develop a tri-Service policy for Operational Stress Management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For former service personnel - veterans - the Department of Health and the Devolved Administrations, with our support, have undertaken community mental health pilots at six NHS Trusts across the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to make it easier for veterans with concerns about their mental health to seek and access help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pilot schemes are now being evaluated which will help with the planning of the future provision of mental health services across the UK from next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On broader healthcare issues, I am confident that anyone who is injured is receiving the very best treatment available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, a dedicated military ward was opened in the new state of the art Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to invest in facilities which will ensure world class clinical care for the treatment and rehabilitation of injured personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if one looks at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court, it is the premier facility for the rehabilitation of injured Service personnel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely impressive, and there’s nothing quite like it available in the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional 29 ward beds have been opened so that Headley Court has spare capacity as a contingency against any increase in demand for in-patient treatment of complex trauma and neurological patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And apparently there is a rumour circulating that there are plans to close this in two years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth and final principle was that we must improve quality and collaboration; putting people first; and reducing duplication of effort and red tape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us here have a role to play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And through-life support will be increasingly important as changes in society and technology compel us to approach issues in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke about healthcare just now, and this is an area where there are good examples of the Government and charities working together to improve the welfare of our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Charity is currently raising £1m to build a Forces Family Centre in the new hospital grounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help for Heroes has helped us to deliver a new rehabilitation complex at Headley Court, including a really amazing swimming pool.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the Army Recovery Capability, which will deliver high quality command and care for wounded, injured, and sick personnel to enable them to return to duty as swiftly as possible; or to make the smoothest transition to an appropriately skilled and supported life outside the Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ARC has been developed, and will be funded, in partnership with Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion, and other Service charities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle Back, through adaptive sports opportunities and adventurous training, offers tremendous potential to aid the rehabilitation of our injured personnel and a return to an active life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the ARC intention is to build a Battle Back Centre with RBL funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to contribute personally, you could buy Tony Blair’s memoirs, since he’s donating the proceeds to this excellent cause…! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, you will understand that I will not be buying it, but will instead donate the amount directly and Gift Aid it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational Welfare is another area where the charitable sector can and does really make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-Christmas period has traditionally seen vast numbers of unsolicited goodwill parcels being sent through the BFPO system, which often means that mail from friends and family is not delivered in good time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid pressures on the supply chain, and indeed operational dangers, we are again running a campaign to encourage the public to show their support in better ways - through ‘uk4u Thanks!’ or the SSAFA Operational Welfare Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, that’s a quick stock-take of recent progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still much to do, though we know that money is tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would add briefly that we’ve been in government for four months only and it would be partisan and unfair of me not to pay tribute to the areas of good work that the previous administration undertook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I hope I have also shown where our priorities lie - particularly our focus on mental health and care for the injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is often not the best answer anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good ideas, and thinking outside the box, are just as precious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we welcome initiatives like Pryors Bank Cafe in Fulham, which was founded by a former soldier, which trains former service personnel to NVQ standard with the chance of working in West End restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not-profit-cafe is run in partnership with the Sir Oswald Stoll foundation - which is a home for ex-service personnel - and supported by RBL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It pays people a wage, gives them a chance to study at college, and assists in finding them accommodation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you are involved with outstanding work like this, make sure that everyone knows about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk in the Government about the ‘Big Society’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I might say so, this is a great example of effective partnerships across the sectors, and the ‘Big Society’ being brought to life for those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
