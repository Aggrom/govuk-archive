    <title>UK Air-Rail Conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along, it’s a genuine pleasure to be here this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="no-nation-was-ever-ruined-by-trade"&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Benjamin Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers, who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No nation was ever ruined by trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That statement was spot on when Ben Franklin made it back in the 18th century and it is spot on today, in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade is Britain’s economic lifeblood. We’re an island nation that’s at our best when we’re a trading nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the very reason this government is re-balancing our economy - moving Britain from a ‘spend and borrow’ past to a ‘make and sell’ future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if they’re going to trade, then our entrepreneurs have to connect - connect with customers and markets, connect with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the modern world that usually means a business trip and a seat on a plane - which also means a journey to an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why air-rail links matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the theme of your conference rightly reminds us, these links are all about ‘connecting for growth’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now ‘growth’ is the word on everyone’s lips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s hardly surprising in these testing times of a Eurozone crisis, a fragile global economy and a record-breaking inherited debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while there is sill a long way to go, recent economic figures show we are moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do think there is a tendency in some quarters to talk about growth as though it’s an abstract concept - something that’s separate and stand-alone; something with a life-force all of its very own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as though some commentators believe growth will magically appear of its own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that it’ll come about if you say the word often enough, or you want it badly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well actually, out there in the real world, you can’t talk or wish an economy into growing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t wave a wand and conjure up growth from thin air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can’t sit back and wait for it to fall in your lap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth comes through hard slog: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the competitive company and the skilled workforce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the inventors and innovators &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the risk takers and wealth creators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and yes… a supportive and empowering government &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is who and what drives growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where transport can play such a massive part - by providing the vital connections that help to support and sustain growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the bottom line is - the government understands the overriding economic imperative of modernising our railways, our airports and the links between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="railways"&gt;Railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take each of those areas in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the railways, where we’re engaged in a massive effort to renew and rebuild Britain’s rail networks - and just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to electrify more than 850 miles of track, compared to the 10 miles electrified by the last administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, right across the country, we’re making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our focus doesn’t begin and end with the conventional railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recognise the huge potential benefits of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re going to build with &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only links London and Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will, of course, give people much quicker journey times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is so much more than simply a faster way to get from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; also means more capacity and better connected cities and regions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets, win new customers and attract new investment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will create and support tens of thousands of jobs and so help to power up the recovery and put people back to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also help to deliver better life chances for millions of people by opening up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a persuasive environmental case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because it will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no exaggeration to say that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make no mistake - the government’s commitment to this game-changing project is full on and flat out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="airports"&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me now turn to the subject of airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity in a box-shaped biplane made of spruce and covered in cotton, air travel has shrunk our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons, personal and business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So airports have a front and centre role in keeping our country prosperous, as well as keeping it connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we’re working hard to make sure the aviation sector continues to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Civil Aviation Bill, legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve consulted on our draft Aviation Policy Framework - a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to increase reliability and reduce delays, we’ve been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thinking ahead too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about the future as just the next 4 or 5 years, but in terms of the next 4 and 5 decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about what those solutions should look like including, I’m sure, many of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports’ Commission to explore the evidence, consider the options and make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Howard has now named the members of his commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its terms of reference have been published. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of work is underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let me be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to this country’s aviation needs, and we believe that the Airports’ Commission is the way to do precisely that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="air-rail-links"&gt;Air-rail links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you take a look at this country’s major airports you will probably notice any number of things that mark them out and make them unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look again though and you’ll also see there are 2 things they have in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they act as global gateways to new markets and new customers - which means they are not just national transport assets, they are national economic assets too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But second, they’re set to become much easier places to get to and fly from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because we’re making real and lasting improvements to those crucial connections between the train and the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me highlight some of the key investments and modernisations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;electrification of the Midland Mainline improves access to Luton, while Valleys electrification improves access to Cardiff Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;electrification and capacity enhancements between Leamington and Coventry enables more Crosscountry trains to run via Birmingham Airport &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra platform capacity at Redhill means more opportunity for Gatwick services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in Greater Manchester the Metrolink tram extension is due to open in 2016 and will take passengers from the city centre into Manchester Airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as part of the Northern Hub improvements, there will be an extra platform at Manchester Airport, which will allow more and longer trains to serve the airport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;investment in the Ordsall Chord and additional platforms at Piccadilly station means that trains from Bradford, Halifax and Rochdale will be able to get to Manchester Airport for the first time &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a new £500 million rail link will give direct western access to Heathrow Airport and is expected to cut passenger journey times from the Thames Valley, the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands by around half an hour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;once it’s completed, Crossrail will provide new services linking Heathrow with the West End, the City of London and Canary Wharf.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to Thameslink, Gatwick will get new direct services to destinations north of London, such as Cambridge, Stevenage and Welwyn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and, not only will &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; make it much easier for passengers from London and the south-east to get to Birmingham Airport… &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will also mean that people and businesses in the Midlands and the north of England get improved access to Heathrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an impressive list of projects and programmes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you add it all up, what you get are train services that work for rail passengers and air passengers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay - whenever I make a speech I’m always conscious of the words of President Bill Clinton who gave the following advice about public speaking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if you can’t say what you want to say in 20 minutes or less, you should go away and write a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m sure that lovers of literature everywhere will be greatly relieved to know that I have no plans whatsoever to be an author - which means it’s time for me to conclude my speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I finish up though there’s something I want you to know, and it’s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting for growth isn’t just at the top of your priority list – it’s right at the heart of our transport policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seamless air-rail journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better, faster, closer links between the station platform and the check-in desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our vision, that’s our ambition and, step by step, that’s what we’re delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Widespread support for greater rail devolution</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers and local communities could achieve better rail services and value for money for taxpayers if they have more say on how their railways are run, according to responses to a government consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback published today also reveals widespread support for rail devolution. The consultation asked individuals, regional groups and interested organisations to give their views on how devolution might work and what the benefits were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail Minister Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are determined to provide the best possible rail services for passengers and ensure that we reduce the cost of running our railways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ensuring decisions are taken by those best placed to make them – those who live and work in those areas – could make certain not only that services are planned to maximise value for money for taxpayers but that passengers get services they need and want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also revealed enthusiastic expressions of interest in helping to manage the railways from regional groups in London, the West Midlands and the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responses highlighted the success of regions where the operation of rail services has already been devolved, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merseyside, where Merseytravel has been responsible for the management of rail services since 2003&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;London, where Transport for London has been responsible for the operation of London Overground services since 2007&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scotland and Wales, where the operation of regional services is managed by the Scottish government and the Welsh Assembly government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses also showed support for transport models specifically designed for particular regions on the basis of local geography and the structure of local networks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consultation document, ‘Rail decentralisation’, was published on 8 March 2012. Comments were invited by the end of June 2012. This is available on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/rail-decentralisation-devolving-decision-making-on-passenger-rail-services-in-england"&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department for Transport’s response to the rail decentralisation consultation is available on &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/rail-decentralisation-devolving-decision-making-on-passenger-rail-services-in-england"&gt;the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government remains committed to seeking to implement an appropriate form of decentralisation in those parts of England where it is sensible to do so. Following the responses to the consultation, &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; will continue informal discussions with those bodies who have submitted proposals or firm expressions of interest. It will consider further a number of issues that need to be resolved in order to proceed with any decentralisation agreement, subject to any changes to franchising policy which may emerge from the Brown review of the rail franchising programme&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most train services are specified, procured and funded centrally by the Department for Transport in London. A public consultation has shown broad support for devolving greater responsibility for local rail services to local authorities, Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) and Transport for London, where conditions are right&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proposals for decentralisation have been received from the Rail in the North consortium comprising Transport for Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire PTE with York City Council and South Yorkshire PTE; Centro and Transport for London&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expressions of interest have been received from West of England Partnership (the Greater Bristol area), Devon and Cornwall Councils, Merseytravel, the Association of North East Councils and Cumbria County Council&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is envisaged that interested bodies will be ready to submit formal proposals in the first half of next year. In the meantime, the Department for Transport will continue informal discussions with these bodies as they prepare and consult on their formal proposal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around 70% of respondents to the consultation said they supported devolution of powers to manage the railways to regional bodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press enquiries: 020 7944 3108&lt;br&gt;
Out of hours: 020 7944 4292&lt;br&gt;
Public enquiries: 0300 330 3000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Westbourne HS2 Alliance dinner</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction James (James Bethall, Westbourne Comms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough the importance of the work the Alliance does to build up a coalition of support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value your support for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; and we need other organisations to continue make the case for &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; in a positive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your efforts are highly regarded and greatly appreciated, so it’s a genuine pleasure to be with you all this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-only-game-in-town"&gt;The only game in town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac Singer, the Polish-American author and Noble Prize winner, once told a journalist: “We have to believe in free will. We’ve got no choice”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s pretty much how I feel about high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m convinced that a high speed rail network won’t simply transform the way we travel in Britain, it will also transform the way we live, work and do business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And transform it for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also one hundred per cent certain that opting out of a high speed future would be a disaster for Britain, a missed opportunity we’d regret for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me, there’s only one choice that makes sense for our country’s success and our children’s future, and that’s &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bigger-picture"&gt;Bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; debate, we can talk about the line of route, design and technology or even mitigation measures and compensation packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these things matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also vital that we never ever lose sight of the bigger picture - the long-term potential of &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the brief time I have tonight, that’s what Id like to focus on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-potential"&gt;Economic potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;’s economic potential:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will mean faster journey times, more capacity and better connected cities and regions - which, in turn, means that British businesses will be able to use it to exploit new markets and win new customers both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also create and support tens of thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; can help to power up the recovery and put people back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="social-potential"&gt;Social potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will help to close the decades’ long north-south divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will help to open up access to employment opportunities and essential services like education and health for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in a very real sense, a high speed rail network is as much about delivering better life chances as it is about getting from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="environmental-potential"&gt;Environmental potential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me then, &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; makes economic and social sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can also see a persuasive environmental case for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because I really do believe that &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; will offer people and businesses a high speed, low carbon alternative to short-haul flying and long-distance motoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="willing-to-accept-unwilling-to-postpone-determined-to-meet"&gt;Willing to accept, unwilling to postpone, determined to meet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I look at the bigger &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; picture I don’t just see an investment in a high &lt;abbr title="technology"&gt;tech&lt;/abbr&gt;, high capacity, high speed rail network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see an investment in a stronger economy, a fairer society and a cleaner and greener environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why it has my full on and flat commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that building high speed rail will be a test of Britain’s energy and skills. And yes, I know this challenge is as big as they come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also know this country - .its people and its companies, its spirit and resolve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I am absolutely convinced it’s a challenge that we in Britain are willing to accept, unwilling to postpone and determined to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, when I first started out in politics I was told that the Golden Rule of public speaking was exhaust neither the subject nor the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, down the years I’ve discovered another rule - never keep an audience from their dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ahead of our dinner and discussion, it only remains for me to say thank you for listening and here’s to a night of good food and great conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Minister views multi-billion pound plans for the north-west</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major upgrade to rail links which will bring over £4 billion of economic benefits to the north-west is progressing well, said Transport Minister Simon Burns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister visited Manchester and Liverpool today to see for himself work on the Northern Hub and plans for the electrification of rail lines – both projects could bring up to 30,000 jobs to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Hub will see a new rail link being built (the Ordsall Chord), stations extended and journey times improved while the electrification programme will enable faster, more reliable and greener trains to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Transport provides the crucial links that allow individuals and communities to prosper and that is why this investment is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Commuters and businesses in the region will be big winners thanks to quicker and greener trains and more services across Manchester. But these improvements will also benefit the UK as a whole due the crucial role the north-west plays in the country’s transport system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This investment demonstrates that the government is delivering on its commitment not only to improve the transport system but also to use it as an engine to drive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his visit the minister toured Manchester Airport and Manchester Airport railway station where he viewed plans for a 4th railway platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new platform will increase capacity by enabling the station to accommodate longer and more trains. He also visited Piccadilly station which will have extra platforms as part of the Northern Hub project and toured Tuebrook Sidings, in Liverpool, which is 1 of 13 compounds which will be used to store materials during the 2nd phase of the north-west electrification scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Northern Hub is a series of proposed projects to boost economic growth through better train services across northern England&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The individual projects were identified in a study published by Network Rail in February 2010&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In July 2012 the government announced it was backing the full scheme. The full package of enhancements is set to be in place by 2019&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The government’s electrification programme will also see rail lines on the Great Western Main Line electrified all the way to the South Wales Valleys. The Midland Main Line between Bedford and Sheffield will also be electrified&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A study by Network Rail estimates the investment will bring over £4 billion of wider economic benefits to the north-west resulting in 30,000 new jobs&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Peterborough Station makeover – official opening</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also for asking me along. It’s a genuine pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my officials first asked me if I was interested in a makeover, I thought they meant for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for my self-esteem the officials in my private office eventually put me straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The makeover is right here at Peterborough Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, looking around, I can see that every penny of that £3 million was well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-makeover-that-really-delivers"&gt;A makeover that really delivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new station front, a bigger main concourse and a much brighter interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new information point, as well as a new customer waiting area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People using the station will feel safer and more secure thanks to improved &lt;abbr title="Closed Circuit Television"&gt;CCTV&lt;/abbr&gt; coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated ticket machines mean less hassle and more convenience for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, talking of convenience, even the toilets have been refurbished.
Looked at from any angle, this is a makeover that really delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m pleased to say it doesn’t stop there. Because I understand there’s more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be new lifts and footbridges, as well extra and longer platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all the work is due to be completed by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bigger-picture"&gt;Bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, the passenger friendly changes we see here are part of a much bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’re actually engaged in a massive rail modernisation effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new services and extra carriages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more seats and faster journeys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transforming conventional rail and backing rail high speed rail &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From massive, multi-billion pound projects like Crossrail, to smaller multi-million pound projects like Peterborough, we’re renewing and rebuilding Britain’s railways and making them truly fit for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="team-effort"&gt;Team effort&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that it takes a real team effort to pull off something like this - from back office to building site, from accountants to architects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as I’m concerned, it doesn’t matter if you were sat in front of a computer or you wore a hard hat, or whether you’re from Network Rail or part of East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were involved in modernising this station then you should feel very proud of yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’d like to take this opportunity to applaud you for an absolutely fantastic job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common interests and a common purpose….coming together and working together to achieve this station improving, passenger friendly end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a big thank-you for all of your hard graft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks--cutting-ribbonplaque-unveiling"&gt;Concluding remarks – cutting ribbon/plaque unveiling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience “I wish they’d gone on longer” is rarely a tribute paid to a public speaker, especially a politician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without any further ado, it’s an honour and a privilege to declare this station open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Nuneaton North Chord event</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for asking me along today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m genuinely delighted to be here because what you’ve achieved with this new chord really matters. And let me tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, today we earn our living in a global marketplace - one where what we sell in Boston or Shanghai is just as important as what we make in Bristol or Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that rail freight is more important than it’s ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving products and raw materials quickly and reliably - that’s how you power up the recovery and grow the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="economic-sense-environmental-sense"&gt;Economic sense, environmental sense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although this new chord isn’t massive in scale like Crossrail or &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;, it’s certainly a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment worth more than £25 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment that will allow freight traffic to travel through Nuneaton station, without affecting passenger services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investment that means better and faster links between the global gateway of Felixstowe and the Midlands, the north west and Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this new chord makes sound economic sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you consider the chord’s potential to cut carbon emissions and ease traffic congestion by attracting freight from road to rail, then it soon becomes obvious that it makes environmental sense too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusions---right-investment-right-project-right-reasons"&gt;Conclusions - right investment, right project, right reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add all that up and what you have is the right investment, in the right project, for the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before I finish I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who made this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have done a terrific job of work and, if I had a hat, I’d take it off to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note it is now my absolute pleasure to declare the Nuneaton North Chord officially open (minister unveils plaque).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>All party parliamentary rail in the north group reception</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="introductory-remarks"&gt;Introductory remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction Julie (Julie Hilling - Chair of &lt;abbr title="All Party Parliamentary Group"&gt;APPG&lt;/abbr&gt;). And many thanks for asking me along today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reputation of this group and its members as rail champions for the north really does go before you, so I’m genuinely delighted to be here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to kick things off with a promise - always a hostage to fortune for a politician I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you all have packed diaries and busy schedules - so I promise to try and keep my speech short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to say keep it “brief”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, since becoming a minister, I’ve discovered that Whitehall is the only place on earth where, without a trace of irony, the term “brief” is used to describe a ten thousand word document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern enough, connected enough, fast enough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a pretty straightforward view about Britain’s rail network, and it’s this - out-dated and over-burdened railways just won’t cut it in today’s global economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They cost hard working families and hard pressed businesses time and money. And, in these testing economic times, you can be sure they are anything but an engine for powering up the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t do our environment too many favours either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, relying on creaking and crumbling rail infrastructure is no way to shrink transport’s carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it doesn’t matter if it’s a regional link or a national network - Britain needs railways that are modern enough, connected enough and fast enough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern enough to support economic growth and spur job creation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connected enough to spread prosperity and open up life-changing chances for people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And fast enough to attract passengers and freight away from less eco-friendly alternatives like long-distance road travel and short-haul flying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="rolling-up-our-sleeves"&gt;Rolling up our sleeves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am absolutely convinced that a good rail system can do great things - socially, economically and environmentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as we all know, the good and the great don’t come about simply because politicians are very keen on them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you only get concrete results by rolling up your sleeves and getting on with it. And that’s precisely what this government’s been doing on rail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£18 billion invested in our railways during this Spending Review period.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A massively ambitious programme of rail modernisation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And a range of groundbreaking reforms…. …from driving down costs and driving up efficiencies to devolving decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, on the second of those reforms, devolution, I know that there was a big response from people and organisations in the north to our rail decentralisation consultation…so I want to thank everyone who took the trouble to have their say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No community left out, no region left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a government that believes in top quality railways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that belief is underpinned by a rock-solid principle. Namely that no community should be left out, no region should be left behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned, if we want all of Britain to be open for business then we can’t afford for any part of Britain to be isolated or disconnected from the country’s wider transport system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local, and actually national success, demands that north, south, east and west are plugged in and joined up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transforming-the-performance-and-prospects-of-rail-in-the-north"&gt;Transforming the performance and prospects of rail in the north&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the very reason that transforming the performance and the prospects of rail in the north is a first order priority for the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when it comes to one particular component of rail services in the north, I’ll admit that the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; hasn’t enjoyed its best media coverage lately. I’m of course talking about the west coast mainline bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious matters tend to generate serious headlines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also demand a serious response…which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger, and more positive, picture about what’s happening to rail in the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take our recent approval of a £4.5 billion contract to build a new generation of intercity trains at a purpose-built factory in County Durham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that passengers will be speeding along the tracks onboard new high-tech, high-spec trains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s also a welcome employment bonus, with the creation of 730 skilled jobs, as well as another 200 jobs during construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget our &lt;abbr title="High level output specification"&gt;HLOS&lt;/abbr&gt; announcement - a £9.4 billion investment programme that will uplift rail capacity and improve rail connections right across the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also pleased to say that work is well underway on the north-west electrification scheme….improving travel between Manchester and Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re not stopping there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we also intend building a brand new electric passenger and freight corridor - a rail spine linking the towns, cities and economies of the North, with the towns, cities and economies of the Midlands and south of England such as Sheffield, Nottingham, Reading and Southampton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electric trains that run on these lines will be cleaner and cheaper to run than diesels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll have better acceleration and shift greater loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’ll carry more passengers with fewer delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plain English our investment is good for passengers, good for business and good for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also tell you that funding worth some £240 million will mean that rail users in the North enjoy more seats, quicker journeys and better services on the East Coast Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, the communities and companies of the region are set to be big winners from the backing the government is giving to the northern hub.&lt;br&gt;
And let me say this - the Northern Hub is about the transforming the rail experience across the whole North, from Newcastle in the north-east to Liverpool in the north-west. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in terms of travel benefits this is a genuine landmark enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s even better news&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because Network Rail estimate the northern hub will also bring over £4 billion worth of wider economic benefits to the region and potentially as many twenty to thirty thousand new jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll forgive the unintended pun, looking down the track there is another game-changing rail modernisation heading towards the North - &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This national high speed rail network will slash journey times and deliver a step change in capacity on routes between Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, London and Manchester - and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firms in the north will be able to use &lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; to exploit new markets and attract new investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the region’s communities will have better access to jobs and essential services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title="High Speed 2"&gt;HS2&lt;/abbr&gt; is a core component of the government’s long-term transport strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, for the sake of every region, it’s a project we’re determined to push across the finishing line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I think it’s time I kept the promise I made right at the start of this speech by winding up my remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s be frank, nobody ever complained that a politician’s’ speech was too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I may, I’d like to finish with a quote by one of America’s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I grant you that’s a less than orthodox way to end a rail speech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, for me, this quote sums up our approach to rail modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the 18th century Ben Franklin argued that, when it came to governing, “well done is better than well said.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask me, that’s a yardstick which still stands the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m equally sure that, judged against it, the way this government is renewing, rebuilding and reforming our railways proves that, just like the great man said - actions really do speak louder than words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Guild of Travel Management Companies conference</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for that introduction Ian (Ian Taylor - travel writer/journalist and conference host).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thank you also to everyone at the Guild for asking me along, it’s a genuine pleasure to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cant-and-wont-ignore-the-facts"&gt;Can’t and won’t ignore the facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not sure if there are any fans of the “Yes Minister” TV series in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you too young to remember, “Yes Minister” was the 1980s version of “The Thick of it” but without the four letter words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s one scene where the civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby, says of the Minister Jim Hacker - “if he can’t ignore the facts he’s no business being a politician.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, based on that definition of politics I’m definitely in the wrong profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s because, when it comes to the relationship between Britain’s transport system and Britain’s business travellers I can’t, and I won’t, ignore the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the facts are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;today we have to earn our living and pay our way in a fast moving global economy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a global economy in which this Association’s members face cut-throat competition. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a global economy where the state of your transport system can be the difference between missing a meeting or making a deal…between winning a contract or losing a customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I have to tell you that those facts have not been lost on the countries we compete against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They know that creaking and crumbling transport links are a business burden that cost time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look around the world - the evidence is there in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From North America to Latin America, and from our continental neighbours to the emerging economic powers of China and India, nation after nation is upgrading and expanding their transport infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bridge they construct, every road they repair and every track they lay is a boost for their businesses and their economies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we really don’t have the luxury of sitting back and looking on while our rivals invest in world class transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are our competition in the international marketplace, the economies we’re up against in a race to win the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if we’re going to out-produce, out-innovate and out-sell them, we cannot afford to be left behind in the starting blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="status-quo---latin-for-the-mess-were-in"&gt;Status quo - Latin for the mess we’re in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s something this guild and its members understand only too well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know better than anyone that ours is a trading nation, as well as an island nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nation where what we sell in Boston or Shanghai is just as important as what we make in Bristol or Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the reason you have consistently called for a transport system that is high quality and high performance - one that helps, not hinders, our business travellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I want you to know that we hear what you say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And trust me…those aren’t just warm words from a minister. The record proves that this is an issue where we are on your side and in your corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the minute we took office, this government made it clear that maintaining the transport status quo was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, as someone once said, “status quo is simply Latin for the mess we’re in”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, that translation has more than a ring of transport truth about it because frankly, we didn’t just inherit a financial deficit back in May 2010, we inherited an infrastructure deficit too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s precisely why we took the deliberate decision to focus time, effort and resources on making Britain’s transport networks fit for the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ll admit that the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt; hasn’t enjoyed its best media coverage lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t for one minute seek to carp or complain about that coverage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious matters like the west coast mainline bid tend to generate serious headlines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also demand a serious response - which is why we are facing up to what went wrong and putting things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None-the less, I genuinely hope that none of the recent coverage obscures the bigger transport picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, I can say with absolute conviction that there has been real success and welcome progress on many of the transport issues that matter most to the people you represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="renewing-and-rebuilding-the-railways"&gt;Renewing and rebuilding the railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the way we’re renewing and rebuilding the railways that so many of your members use and rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re engaged in a massive modernisation effort. And just this summer we announced a new rail investment programme worth more than £9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re driving through landmark projects like Crossrail, Thameslink and the Northern Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to electrify more than 850 miles of track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, right across the country, we’re making rail travel a whole lot better with new services and extra carriages, more seats and faster journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our focus doesn’t begin and end with the conventional railways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like this guild, the government recognise the huge benefits of high speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, just like you, we also know that our country and our economy need more than a high speed line - they need a high speed network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re committed to building with HS2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only links London and Birmingham. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also speeds further north to Manchester and Leeds, and possibly to Edinburgh and Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A network that not only opens up business opportunities at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one that also opens up business opportunities abroad by ensuring passengers have an opportunity to connect up with the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS2 will transform the way we live and work every bit as much as it transforms the way we travel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make no mistake, the government is determined to push this project across the finishing line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="first-class-highways"&gt;First class highways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, business travellers don’t just need top-notch railways - they also need first rate highways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve been investing in this country’s roads and motorways too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cutting congestion by removing bottlenecks and tackling pinch points on vital corridors like the M5 and the M27&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using innovations like hard shoulder running and managed motorways to unlock capacity on crucial arteries like the M1 and the M25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;even supporting the uptake of electric cars with a nationwide network of re-charging points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this, and more, is designed to help motorists here and now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve also been thinking carefully about the key long-term challenges by undertaking a major Feasibility Study: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking at how we can best secure new investment capital &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reviewing new models of ownership and financing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and weighing up the most effective and efficient ways to maintain and modernise our strategic road network &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today and tomorrow - modern highways for a modern Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our vision, and that’s what we’re working hard to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="aviation"&gt;Aviation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spoken about rail and road, let me now turn a subject that rarely fails to generate debate and discussion - aviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Wright Brothers defied gravity, air travel has shrunk our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in doing so, it has also broadened our horizons - personal and business &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s little wonder that issues like airport capacity and connectivity are high on the agenda for this guild and its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as the minister responsible for aviation, my response is the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m with you - aviation is a big deal. It matters, it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me quickly walk you through some of the things being done to make sure the aviation sector is successful and sustainable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re steering the Civil Aviation Bill through Parliament - legislation that will improve the passenger experience by reforming the 25 year old set of regulations that currently govern our main airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re just about to finish consulting on our draft Aviation Policy Framework- a framework that forms the basis for future sustainable aviation growth in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase reliability and reduce delays we’ve been trialling operational freedoms at Heathrow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, from electrifying rail tracks to building new rail links, we’re improving the connections between the train and the plane at airports like Stansted and Cardiff, Luton and Manchester, Birmingham and Heathrow, Gatwick and Coventry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all global gateways to new markets and new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they’re all set to become much easier places to get to, and fly from, when you’re travelling on business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thinking ahead too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that the future of aviation in Britain is one where our airports are globally competitive and where you can connect to places all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m not talking about the future as just the next 4, 5, 6 years - but in terms of the next 4, 5 and 6 decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacity, connectivity, hub status - aviation faces long-term challenges that require long-term solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lots of people and lots of organisations have ideas about how to meet those challenges, including this Guild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’ve asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission to consider the connectivity needs of the UK, and to make recommendations to government on how those needs can be met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I expect that Sir Howard will soon be setting out further details on the membership of the Commission and its work, including how he intends engaging with interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is determined to build the consensus needed to deliver a lasting solution to the issue of the UK’s aviation capacity and we believe that Sir Howard Davies’ Commission is the way to do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, the Commission is in its early stages, but we are convinced that it will deliver and help us to maintain the UK’s hub status. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wi-fi"&gt;Wi-fi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one last area I want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the usual “planes, trains and automobiles” stuff of business travel. But, in today’s internet driven world, it’s perhaps just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about Wi-fi connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern business traveller doesn’t just ply their trade in face to face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a smart phone, a lap-top or the latest touch-screen tablet they work on the move, they work at home and they work outside of normal office hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that makes fast and reliable Wi-fi connections a business must, a business essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know it. Your members know it. And I’m pleased to be able to tell you that this government knows it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve made broadband one of our top infrastructure priorities and published a National Broadband Strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve set up a “Broadband Delivery UK” team in Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve given that team £530 million to help bring superfast broadband to homes and businesses across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ve announced a special £100 million fund to help ten major cities become “super-connected cities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This country’s Britain’s business travellers deserve world class Wi-fi connections, as well world class transport connections - and we’re working hard to delver both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks"&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Britain’s transport networks are its arteries of trade, then this guild’s members are surely the heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our business travellers - clocking up the miles, putting in the hard graft, making sure that Britain is always open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before I conclude, I just wanted to pay tribute to the work you do and the difference you make - this minister and this government recognise, value and appreciate everything you’re doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, having started off with a quote from a British comedy, I’d liked to finish off with one by an American President - Harry Truman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Truman once offered the following advice on public speaking - “If you can’t convince ‘em, confuse ‘em.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I hope that in speaking to you today I’ve been more convincing than confusing. I’ve certainly enjoyed having this chance to come along and talk about some of the things we’re doing to support the crucial work you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thank you for you time. I thank you for listening. And I look forward to working with you all in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speech represented existing departmental policy but the words may not have been the same as those used by the minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-unveils-generous-hs2-compensation-package"/>
    <title>Government unveils generous HS2 compensation package</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents affected by the first phase of HS2 from London to the West Midlands will be offered a comprehensive package of compensation measures which go significantly beyond statutory requirements, the government confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS2, a national high-speed rail network linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds with London and Heathrow, will transform the UK - bringing cities together, delivering jobs and growth, and providing a long-term solution to the capacity crunch facing the existing rail network. Stations will also be situated in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire, while high speed trains will continue on the existing rail network to serve destinations further north and into Scotland. The government has already consulted on the route of the first phase of the project to the West Midlands and the Transport Secretary will publish his preferred routes for the second phase of the scheme later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the government recognises the impact the project is having on property markets along the first phase of the route and, after careful consideration, has decided to go above and beyond what is required by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures proposed today go beyond the statutory requirements by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;providing a government commitment to buy any owner-occupied home in the ‘safeguarded area’ closest to the route - as set out in law, the government will then pay the full un-blighted value of the property, along with additional compensation of 10% up to a value of £47,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;establishing a ‘voluntary purchase zone’ immediately outside of the safeguarded area in rural areas, within which homeowners can sell their homes at their full un-blighted value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a long term hardship scheme to help those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a sale and rent back scheme to give more flexibility to homeowners who wish to stay in properties which will ultimately be required to allow for construction work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a package of measures to provide clarity and reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels, including before and after surveys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a commitment to work with local authorities, housing associations and affected tenants to develop a strategy for replacing any lost social rented housing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail minister Simon Burns said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;HS2 will completely transform the UK. It will define our country, not just for the 21st century but beyond - linking our major cities in a way previous generations could only dream of.
&amp;gt; No major infrastructure project on this scale can be built without some impact on local communities, but I am determined to do everything I can to minimise the effect of HS2 on those closest to the line.
&amp;gt; We have developed the right compensation package, providing absolutely the right support for those affected, while at the same time protecting the interests of taxpayers. We have thought long and hard about this and the measures I have announced are fair and strike the right balance for local communities and the British taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compensation package announced today is comparable with the arrangements put in place for homeowners affected by the construction of HS1. It will now be subject to a period of consultation until 31 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the proposed compensation package, HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport has also launched a three-month consultation aimed at local authorities on safeguarding the land needed in order to build and run the line between London and the West Midlands. Safeguarding is the technical term for the planning mechanism that protects large-scale public infrastructure projects from conflicting developments nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="notes-to-editors"&gt;Notes to Editors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation document &lt;a rel="external" href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/property-compensation-london-to-west-midlands"&gt;High Speed Two: Property and Compensation for London - West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; closes on 31 January 2013: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultation events for the property compensation consultation will take place along the line of route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further information is available on the &lt;a rel="external" href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/"&gt;high speed rail consultation website&lt;/a&gt; or by contacting the HS2 enquiries line on: 0207 944 4908.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="safeguarding-consultation"&gt;Safeguarding Consultation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consultation document &lt;a rel="external" href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/safeguarding"&gt;High Speed Two: Safeguarding for London - West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; is available and closes on 31st January 2013: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation is aimed at planning authorities. An email is being sent to local authorities, community forums and MPs inviting them to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further details on the compensation measures published today: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streamlined system of advanced purchase within the safeguarded zone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these measures, owner-occupiers of residential properties and owners of commercial properties (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) where some or all of the property is within the safeguarded area (usually 60 metres either side of the track) will be able to ask the government to purchase their property under compulsory terms at a time of their choosing after safeguarding directions are made (expected Spring 2013). This means they will receive the unblighted open market value of the property, a home loss payment (10% of the value of the property, up to £47,000) and disturbance costs (such as fees, removal costs and stamp duty on a new property of equivalent value).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government proposes that where the entirety of an eligible property is within the safeguarded area and the owner asks the government to purchase their property we will agree, whether it is actually required for the railway or not. We will also consider purchase requests where only part of a property is within the safeguarded zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlined system for voluntary purchase within a new voluntary purchase zone in rural areas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will also establish a new voluntary purchase zone outside of the immediate safeguarded zone within which owner-occupiers of residential property or owners of commercial property (with a rateable value not exceeding £34,800) will be also able to ask the government to purchase their property for its unblighted open market value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the impact of HS2 on the property market has been and is expected to continue to be greater in rural areas than in urban areas the Voluntary Purchase Zone will run from the M25 northwards to the south of the delta junction to Birmingham and to the north of the delta junction with the junction with the West Coast Main Line. The voluntary purchase zone will cover an area 120m either side of the line of route, except over bored tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hardship scheme for those beyond the safeguarded and voluntary purchase zones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with a need to move during the development of HS2 but who are unable to sell their home despite being outside both the safeguarded area and the voluntary purchase zone will be able to apply to have the government purchase their homes under a hardship scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sale and rent back scheme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow homeowners whose property will need to be demolished to sell their property to the government when they wish but remain in their homes as tenants until their land is actually needed for construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of measures designed to provide peace of mind for property owners above tunnels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing before and after surveys at government expense and a ‘settlement deed’ which will guarantee that HS2 would be liable for any damage caused by tunnelling, in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the safeguarding consultation is aimed primarily at local authorities, individuals are welcome to contribute if they wish. However, if they are particularly interested in the proposed compensation arrangements for the impact safeguarding has on their home or property, they are encouraged to respond to the property and compensation consultation.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Airports Operators Association</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="govspeak"&gt;&lt;h2 id="opening-remarks"&gt;Opening remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Andrew. Ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to Ed for inviting me to speak today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years it has become something of a tradition for transport ministers to speak at the &lt;abbr title="Airports Operators Association"&gt;AOA&lt;/abbr&gt; conference….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only because it’s firmly established as one of the most important events in the aviation calendar….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also because it attracts such a distinguished and expert audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m delighted to be here today - and to have this opportunity to talk about the crucial role that aviation has to play in our economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="years-of-change"&gt;20 years of change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now - both the new Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin and I are politicians of a certain vintage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together we have clocked up more than 25 years of service as MPs, ministers, and whips in government and Opposition - including for Patrick a three year stint as Minister for Aviation in Margaret Thatcher’s last government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back over that time, it’s extraordinary to see how the aviation industry has changed….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deregulation of air travel in Europe, and the proliferation of hundreds of new routes from UK airports….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low-cost, no-frills revolution, which helped make flying affordable to millions more Britons…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global reassessment of airport security after 9/11….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the impact of the internet on the way we shop for flights and holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while aviation has changed over the past two decades, our job in government remains precisely the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stimulating growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling every possible lever to create jobs, attract investment, and help some people get on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick and I were part of a government that not only experienced the recession of the early 1990s…. but that also took the tough decisions needed to lead our economy out of recession….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions that built a foundation for growth and prosperity lasting well into the following decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what we’re in government to do again today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="transport-and-growth"&gt;Transport and growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to be part of the ministerial team at the &lt;abbr title="Department for Transport"&gt;DfT&lt;/abbr&gt;, because I’m a firm believer in the transformational potential of transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my book, transport doesn’t just support growth. It creates it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why Britain was so powerful in the 18th and 19th centuries was its relatively easy and affordable access to a massive world market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was Britain’s mastery of trade routes - over sea and over land - that gave us such a huge competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to transport, Britain had better, faster and cheaper links to raw materials - and to a global customer base - than its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it is the same ready access that is driving the growth of economies like China, India, and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lessons for developed countries like Britain are clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply making the best products is of no use if you can’t connect with the right market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Britain has failed to invest in its transport infrastructure, and we are paying the price today in lost growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why we are investing in our roads and railways, to reduce congestion and overcrowding, and link businesses with buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why we are investing in a new high speed rail network - so firms in Leeds and Manchester and Liverpool can connect with customers in London and Lille.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is why - in a fast changing industry like aviation - we need a clear strategy to boost passenger service, and maintain our excellent air links with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I will explain shortly, any such strategy needs to stand firm over a period of more than a decade - and across several General Elections. That is why it is so important that we take the time we need to get this right and to build a strong consensus of opinion behind the best option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-were-doing"&gt;What we’re doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been real progress under this government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are taking forward the Civil Aviation Bill to modernise the regulatory framework for civil aviation in the UK. The Bill enables the &lt;abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority"&gt;CAA&lt;/abbr&gt; to bring a strong consumer focus to its activities, improving transparency and accountability, and ensuring a better service for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations of the South East Airports Taskforce are being implemented, including a trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow to improve reliability and reduce delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve announced a number of short-term measures to improve operations and stimulate growth, including £500 million towards a western rail link to Heathrow….. a review of the UK’s visa regime…. and the recruitment of extra border staff at Heathrow….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in July we published a draft Aviation Policy Framework (APF) and have put it out for formal public consultation - so that the final Framework can be adopted by the end of March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final version of this key document will then be a formal statement of government policy setting the high-level parameters within which any new proposals for airport development may be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="connectivity-and-hub-capacity"&gt;Connectivity and hub capacity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These improvements are timely and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will not on their own solve our long-term connectivity and capacity issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are well served today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is one of the best connected countries on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London has more flights to more destinations than any other city in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are fortunate to have so many flights to important trading partners - and global financial centres - like New York, Singapore and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what is still a dynamic market, new routes and services continue to be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the end of this month, for instance, the UK will be served by daily flights to Guangzhou - a city that has been held up in the past as an example of our national failure to secure routes into the developing Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New services to Mexico City were announced only last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course new destinations are being offered all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But UK aviation is not only about the South East of England.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate in this country to have so many excellent airports outside London, which not only help attract inward investment, and provide access to the global market…they also act as major employers in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the downturn has affected most &lt;abbr title="Airports Operators Association"&gt;AOA&lt;/abbr&gt; members, just like it has businesses throughout the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many airports outside London and the South East continue to perform exceptionally well considering the wider economic picture.…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Manchester, which saw passenger numbers rise by 6% to 19 million in 2011, to Belfast International, and Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growth is being supported by significant investment - at airports like Birmingham, Newcastle, and Bristol - to boost capacity and improve the passenger experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the growth of airports throughout the UK cannot disguise the wider reality that Britain has failed to follow Germany, France and the Netherlands in planning for our long-term connectivity needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger is that we risk seeing our direct European competitors benefiting more from the fast growing markets of emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="difficult-decision"&gt;Difficult decision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are absolutely clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the UK’s status as a leading global aviation hub is fundamental to our long term international competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet - at the same time - we must also take full account of the social, environmental and other impacts of any expansion in airport capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most difficult debates in transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few other issues have the same potential to provoke a divided response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successive governments have sought to develop a credible long term aviation policy to meet the international connectivity needs of the UK……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in each case the policy has failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either trust in the process has broken down….. consensus on the evidence for the policy has drained away…… or it has proved too difficult to sustain a challenging long term policy through a change of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only can the aviation industry ill afford for this indecision and failure to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country can’t afford it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="commission"&gt;Commission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the government has asked Sir Howard Davies to chair an independent Airports Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Howard’s remit is to identify and recommend the options for maintaining this country’s status as a global hub for aviation - and indeed as Europe’s most important aviation hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission will also evaluate how any additional capacity requirements should be met in the short, medium and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coalition Agreement is clear, and continues to represent the position of this government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the commission must consider all options if it to reach the best conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes a third runway at Heathrow, and schemes in the Thames Gateway proposed by the Mayor of London and by Norman Foster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission will be fair and open, taking account of the views of passengers, residents, the aviation industry, business, local and devolved government and environmental groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interim report will be prepared for government no later than the end of 2013, and a final report by the summer of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be in a position to tell you more about the membership of the commission and its terms of reference in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission’s work will not clash in any way with the draft Aviation Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it will complement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we publish the final policy framework next year, it will still establish the high level aviation policy of this government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means it will set the parameters within which Sir Howard will consider the aviation needs of this country - and the options for delivering those needs in the short, medium and longer terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework consultation is therefore an important opportunity to influence government aviation policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank those of you who have engaged with us during the consultation - and encourage those who have not submitted a response to do so in the next few weeks before the end of this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course I can’t speculate on what the conclusions of the commission will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I can assure you of is the importance of this work - and the determination of this government to find a solution that’s best for Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will seek to involve the opposition throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I hope all main parties will back Sir Howard’s findings - because it’s crucial that we make a commitment that transcends party politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Olympics have shown just what we can do if we are willing to make big decisions, work together, and stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the transport system during the Games was the result of co-ordinated planning by the Coalition and the previous government, Transport for London, the Department for Transport, and many other organisations over many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to pay tribute to many of the companies and organisations represented here today who worked so hard during the Olympics to provide such a welcoming and professional service to visitors who flew in from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a major logistical challenge for the aviation industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many predicted failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you showed a real spirit of collaboration and collective determination to turn it into a triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is that same spirit - of working in partnership towards common goals - that we need to foster again…. once conclusions have been drawn from the work of the commission and the aviation policy framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we all realise that we are living through some of the toughest economic conditions for generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are also living through a time of great opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either we can repeat history, and fail once again to confront the infrastructure problems which hold our economy back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or we can learn the lessons from history, and build a better future for Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what we are doing in government. And with your help, that is what we will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank-you very much indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
