  </header><p>If your vehicle has been damaged and your insurance company writes your vehicle off, you’ll need to hand the vehicle over to them to be disposed of.</p>

<p>If your vehicle isn’t written off but you still want to scrap it, you can take it to an authorised treatment facility (<abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you break it up yourself, you’ll have to make a <a href="/register-sorn-statutory-off-road-notification" title="Make a SORN (Statutory Off Road Declaration)">SORN (Statutory Off Road Declaration)</a> or keep taxing it until you take it to an <abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr>.</p>


</article><article id="if-your-insurance-company-writes-off-your-vehicle"><header><h1>Part 2: If your insurance company writes off your vehicle</h1>
  </header><p>If your insurance company decides to write off your vehicle, you’ll need to hand the vehicle over to them to dispose of.</p>

<p>You’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>complete the V5C/3 ‘Notification of sale or transfer’ section of your registration certificate and send it to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>  </li>
  <li>give the rest of the registration certificate to your insurance company</li>
</ul>
<p>Your insurance company may ask you for the whole registration certificate. </p>

<p>If this happens, write a letter with details of your insurance company and the date you gave them the vehicle to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>. </p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

</p></div></div>

<p>If your vehicle doesn’t get scrapped and you want to keep the salvage, you should keep the V5C registration certificate.</p>

<p>If you want to repair the vehicle and put it back on the road you may need to take it for a <a href="/vehicle-identity-check" title="Vehicle Identity Check (VIC)">Vehicle Identity Check (VIC)</a>.</p>


</article><article id="scrapping-your-vehicle"><header><h1>Part 3: Scrapping your vehicle</h1>
  </header><p>To scrap your vehicle you must take it to an <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/65470.aspx/" title="authorised treatment facility (ATF)">authorised treatment facility (<abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr>)</a> who’ll make sure it’s dismantled in an environmentally friendly way.</p>

<h2>Cars, light vans and 3-wheeled vehicles</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr> agrees to scrap your vehicle they’ll give you a Certificate of Destruction (<abbr title="Certificate of Destruction">CoD</abbr>) straightaway or within 7 days of issue if you’re scrapping a:</p>

<ul>
<li>car</li>
  <li>light van</li>
  <li>3-wheeled motor vehicle (but not a motor tricycle)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Certificate of Destruction">CoD</abbr> is proof that the vehicle has been destroyed and you’re not responsible for it any more. The <abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr> will tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> that you’re no longer responsible for the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Other types of vehicle</h2>

<p>If you want to scrap any other type of vehicle you can still take it to an <abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr>, but you won’t get a <abbr title="Certificate of Destruction">CoD</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr> will tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, who will update the vehicle record to say it’s been destroyed. Then you should complete the V5C/3 ‘Notification of sale or transfer’ part of your V5C vehicle registration certificate and send it to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should get a letter saying you’re no longer responsible for the vehicle. If you don’t get this letter within 4 weeks, call <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>If you’ve broken up the vehicle yourself</h2>

<p>If you’ve broken up the vehicle yourself you must <a href="/register-sorn-statutory-off-road-notification" title="make a SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification)">make a <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr> (Statutory Off Road Notification)</a> or continue to tax the vehicle. </p>

<p>You’ll have to make a <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr> every year until you’ve taken it to an <abbr title="Authorised Treatment Facility">ATF</abbr> or told <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> you no longer have it.</p>

<p>Tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> by sending in your V5C/3 ‘Notification of sale or transfer’ part of your V5C vehicle registration certificate or writing a letter to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> explaining you no longer have the vehicle. </p>

  </header><p>If your vehicle has got a <a href="/personalised-vehicle-registration-numbers" title="personalised registration">personalised registration</a>, you’ll have to transfer or retain it using form V317 before it gets scrapped.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you don’t, you’ll lose your entitlement to the personalised registration number.</p>

<p>If your vehicle is being written off by your insurance company, you’ll need to tell them not to dispose of the vehicle until your personalised registration has been transferred or retained.</p>

<p>You should also ask them to make sure the vehicle is available for inspection.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to get a:</p>

<ul>
