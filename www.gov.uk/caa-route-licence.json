The difference between them lies in the way space on the aircraft is sold:  \r\n\r\n- scheduled licences authorise flights where at least some of the capacity is sold direct to the public without the involvement of a charterer\r\n- charter licences authorise flights where all the capacity on the aircraft is sold to one or more charterers for resale\r\n\r\nCompleted applications should be sent to the CAA's Airline Licensing and Consumer Issues team.\r\n\r\nThere is no charge for applying for a route licence.\r\n\r\nIf the CAA is satisfied that a licence should be granted, it will normally publish details of your application on its website and, if an interested party submits a written objection, hold a public hearing at which you can provide evidence in support of your application.\r\n\r\nYou'll be notified of the CAA's decision at the end of the hearing.\u00a0\r\n\r\nA licence may be granted subject to such terms as the CAA thinks appropriate.\r\n\r\nLicences will last indefinitely, provided that your operating licence is not suspended or revoked.\r\n\r\nHowever, holding a route licence does not automatically allow you to start operating. You'll also need to be granted traffic rights by the government at the other end of the route. Negotiation of traffic rights is undertaken by the Department for Transport (DfT), although charter services airlines are generally required to seek permits directly from the countries concerned.\u00a0 The DfT will be able to provide more information on the availability of traffic rights.\r\n\r\n##Fines and penalties\r\nIf you operate flights outside the EEA without a route licence or in breach of any terms of your licence, you may be fined, imprisoned for up to two years or both.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFlights to or from the UK using foreign-registered aircraft (whether operated by a UK licensed airline, another EEA carrier or a non-EEA airline) are not covered by route licences but by permits granted by the DfT.
