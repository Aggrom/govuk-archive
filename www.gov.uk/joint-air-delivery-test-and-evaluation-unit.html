<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit (<abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>) is located at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Brize Norton and comprises of 124 (Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force and Civil Service) personnel commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel. </p>

<p>Our mission is to enable the delivery by air of manpower, machines and materiel through development, trials and training, in order to enhance Defence Capability.</p>

<p>Its chain of command is through the development division of the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Air Warfare Centre which comes under Chief of Staff Operations (<abbr title="Chief of Staff Operations">COS(Ops)</abbr>) HQ Air Command. The unit is parented for administration purposes by <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Brize Norton.</p>

<p>The unit, comprising of 5 lead sections and support staff, undertakes a wide variety of tasks as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Airportability Section: Conduct operational test and evaluation loading trials in order to produce amendments to associated Aircraft Publications</li>
  <li>Aerial Delivery Section: The Aerial Delivery Section at <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> is responsible for trialling equipment for aerial delivery suitability, and trial and develop new aerial delivery systems</li>
  <li>Personnel Parachuting Test Team: The delivery of personnel by parachute, both overtly and covertly, to land or sea</li>
  <li>Helicopter Section: <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> Helicopter Section is responsible for the assessment and trial of all equipment that is to be underslung from UK military helicopters</li>
  <li>Training Section: The sole UK provider for the training of Defence instructors in helicopter handling, abseiling and fast roping, as well as equipment trials and evaluations. It provides SME advice to all UK Defence and security agencies as well as supporting Defence diplomacy worldwide</li>
  <li>Engineering Support Section: Provides specialist engineering support and airworthiness advice to <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> trials sections, Industry and <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> (Ministry of Defence) Project Teams</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>’s primary output is the management of the status of twenty two Air Transport Aircraft Publications which detail the procedures to be followed and the equipment needed to safely and effectively deliver personnel and materiel. This it does through the conduct of operational trials and evaluation on behalf of sponsors. In addition it provides advice / recommendations to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> sponsors, agencies, civilian industry and foreign governments on all air transport matters.</p>

<ul>
<li>ISO 9001: <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> received ISO 9001 Accreditation on 19 March 1997 which means that we meet the requirements of the international standard for quality assurance. More recently we have become ISO 9000:2008 compliant. </li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Design Approval Organisation Scheme">DAOS</abbr>: Within the Design Approval Organisation Scheme (<abbr title="Design Approval Organisation Scheme">DAOS</abbr>), <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> has Design Approval Status, from the UK <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Defence Equipment and Support Agency (<abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support Agency">DE&amp;S</abbr>), for aerial delivery systems and other air transport related equipment.</li>

<h4 id="chain-of-command">Chain of Command</h4>

<p>Although a joint tri-service unit, Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit (<abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>) is within a <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> chain of command. The unit is part of the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Air Warfare Centre [AWC - based at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Waddington] which is part of HQ Air Command [based at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> High Wycombe].  </p>

<p>With the majority of aircraft used by <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> being owned by the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> and with the unit being based at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Brize Norton, being within this single service chain of command has distinct advantages.  </p>

<p>Within the AWC, <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> is grouped in the development area with the AWC Operational Evaluation Units (<abbr title="Operational Evaluation Units">OEUs</abbr>) which conduct trials and evaluation of aircraft, associated weapons, ancillary equipment and air doctrine. </p>

<h4 id="personnel">Personnel</h4>

<p><abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> is a truly Joint Service unit with 124 personnel from all 3 Services and the Civil Service.  From within the services a variety of trade disciplines are present covering administrative, technical, logistic and combat areas. </p>

<p>The majority of Civil Service personnel come from the technical grades. However both administrative and industrial grades are also represented.</p>

<p>Mission: To enable the effective transportation of materiel in fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft in support of UK military commitments by conducting airportability trial and evaluation activities.</p>

<p>Main Effort </p>

<ol>
<li>support to Ops</li>
  <li>production of air transport aircraft loading Air Publications</li>
  <li>A400M Entry into Service</li>
  <li>provision of airportability subject matter expertise</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="aim">Aim</h3>

<p>Airportability Section (<abbr title="Airportability Section">AP Section</abbr>) aim to develop techniques and procedures for the loading and restraint of equipment and vehicles in fixed and rotary winged aircraft. Able to provide advice on all airportability issues in order to meet the requirements of <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> customers, <abbr title="Airportability Section">AP Section</abbr> regularly provide subject matter experts (<abbr title="subject matter experts">SMEs</abbr>) to MoD agencies and the wider aviation community. </p>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p><abbr title="Airportability Section">AP Section</abbr> produce tie down schemes (<abbr title="tie-down schemes">TDS</abbr>) which detail the correct loading, restraint and unloading procedures for equipment and vehicles in <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> fixed and rotary wing aircraft.
The airportability trial methodically assesses assets against strict criteria. These criteria include dangerous goods classification, loading and unloading ability, restraint rating and overall aircraft-specific qualification. Another important aspect of the section’s work is the provision of advice to service establishments and external agencies. </p>

<h3 id="advice-to-external-agencies">Advice to external agencies.</h3>

<p>In addition to routine airportability trial work, <abbr title="Airportability Section">AP Section</abbr> provides subject-matter expertise to external agencies such as the <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support Agency">DE&amp;S</abbr>, Defence Logistics Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Logistics Organisation">DLO</abbr>), Defence Export Services Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Export Services Organisation">DESO</abbr>) and civilian industry on all aspects of transportability of equipment in <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> air transport aircraft, to include advice at both the design and prototype stage of a project. The Airportability Section also provides advice to, and liaises with, NATO and other nationalities.</p>

<h3 id="aircraft">Aircraft</h3>

<p><abbr title="Airportability Section">AP Section</abbr> routinely produces tie down schemes for the following in-service aircraft: </p>

<ul>
<li>Boeing Globemaster III, C-17 (A)</li>
  <li>Lockheed Hercules, C-130K</li>
  <li>Lockheed Hercules, C-130J</li>
  <li>Boeing Chinook</li>
  <li>EHI Merlin Mk 3</li>

<li>Russian sub rescue</li>
  <li>Special Forces equipment</li>
  <li>Battle damaged aircraft</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exceptional-tasks">Exceptional Tasks</h3>

<p>In the event of global or national disaster and crisis, <abbr title="Airportability Section">AP Section</abbr> may be called upon to deliver expertise and support wherever airportability operations are required. The Section also provides support in efforts such as crash recovery and when called upon to provide support to civilian powers. </p>

<ul>
<li>Tsunami relief operations</li>
  <li>Aircraft crash recovery</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="airbus---a400m">Airbus - A400M</h3>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>In the In the early 1990s it was recognised by a number of European Nations that their ageing military air transport fleet of C-130 Hercules and C-160 Transall’s needed replacing.<br>
In response, a European Staff Requirement was drawn up and the A400M was chosen by UK, Germany, France, Belgium, Luxemburg, Spain and Turkey as the aircraft of choice. </p>

<p>For the UK in particular the A400M would replace the C130K fleet and offer a larger cargo carrying volume, a greater maximum payload and higher cruise speed.  </p>

<p>When in <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Service the 25 A400M aircraft will make up over half of the UK’s rear cargo door air transport capability.  </p>

<h4 id="a400m-airportability">A400M Airportability</h4>

<p>A400M Airportability On delivery the A400M will be fully certified by Airbus to carry up to 116 passengers and wheeled and palletised loads up to 32,000 kg. To assist with a seamless entry into service from an airportability perspective, a 5 man <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Movements team of A400M SME’s has been set up within <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> to clear for airportability some 650 items of in-service military equipment prior to the delivery of the first aircraft. The 650 items consist of helicopters, tracked, wheeled, palletised and specialist equipment.   </p>

<p>To qualify these items and future equipment for airportability, <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> are procuring, through the A400M Project Team (<abbr title="Project Team">PT</abbr>) and via Airbus Military (<abbr title="Airbus Military">AMSL</abbr>), a ‘state-of-the-art’ 1–1 scale Cargo Hold Mock Up (<abbr title="Cargo Hold Mock Up">CHMU</abbr>) of the UK A400M. The <abbr title="Cargo Hold Mock Up">CHMU</abbr> will have full kneeling, hiking and ramp/ toe movement capabilities and can support an item in excess of 32,000 kg.   </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> A400M Programme is the lead organisation in load clearance and airportability for A400M. The other participating nations are looking closely at how <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> do business in order to harmonize their own airportability processes and aid future A400M interoperability.</p>

<h4 id="a400m-capabilities">A400M Capabilities</h4>

<p>The A400M is a medium range aircraft that can be used in either the strategic or tactical role. It has the ability to deploy troops and freight between theatres or within theatre of operations either by parachute or by landing on short, semi-prepared strips and can carry up to 30 tonnes as far as Goose Bay or Gander or anywhere in the Mediterranean. </p>

<p>It is a wide-body medium to heavy lift aircraft able to accept larger loads than the C-130 and capable of positioning vehicles side by side. Designed to be multi-role capable, it can carry passengers, cargo, mail, airdrop and conduct Medical Evacuation (<abbr title="Medical Evacuation">MEDEVAC</abbr>), Air to Air Refuelling (<abbr title="Air to Air Refuelling">AAR</abbr>) and Search and Rescue (<abbr title="Search and Rescue">SAR</abbr>). The aircraft can kneel or hike its tail to assist the loading of cargo and helicopters.  The main floor dimensions are 17.25m (664in) long, 4m (157in) wide and 4m high.</p>

<h2 id="aerial-delivery-section">Aerial Delivery Section</h2>

<p>The Aerial Delivery Section produces safe, tactically sound and effective procedures for the aerial delivery of equipment and supplies in order to meet tri-service operational requirements.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h3>

<p>The Aerial Delivery (AD) Section is one of the lead sections within the <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> and is split into sub sections; light drop (<abbr title="light drop">LD</abbr>) and heavy drop (<abbr title="heavy drop">HD</abbr>). Expertise is drawn from Army RLC Air Despatchers and REME Engineers. Responsible for carrying out of Operational Test and Evaluation on all aerial delivery systems, the section devises methods for delivering vehicles, boats and light stores under parachute. The section also produces rigging schemes, installation and despatch procedures applicable to a specific aircraft type. </p>

<h3 id="initial-assessment">Initial assessment</h3>

<p>Once tasked by the sponsor, the Lead Project Officer (<abbr title="Lead Project Officer">LPO</abbr>) completes a comprehensive ground assessment to assess load configurations, suitability of in-service ancillary equipment, design and manufacture of any prototype equipment and any safety implications which may affect the aircraft. </p>

<h3 id="static-drop-trials">Static drop trials</h3>

<p>A static drop may be carried out to ensure the load meets the specification and functionality required to perform its task. This is carried out beneath a gantry at a predetermined height to simulate the effects of an actual airdrop. This information helps determine the robustness of the loads under various drop conditions prior to conducting a live air drop.</p>

<h3 id="airdrop-trials">Airdrop trials</h3>

<p>Airdrop trials are conducted at suitable drop zones (<abbr title="drop zones">DZ</abbr>) in the UK and overseas. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="light drop">LD</abbr> section is responsible for testing and evaluating the robustness of stores that are required to be air dropped for all 3 services. When testing is complete, the relevant information is gathered in order to produce rigging schemes, clearances/checklists, and despatch procedures for the Hercules C-130K &amp; C-130J. Light drop trials have grown in importance over the years. Re-supply from the air negates the need for time consuming and dangerous Combat Logistic Patrols (<abbr title="Combat Logistic Patrols">CLP</abbr>) and frees up ground troops for manoeuvre operations. </p>

<p>The current air drop systems in use from the Hercules C-130 range from small bundles weighing a minimum of 23 Kg (harness packs) up to large boat systems weighing approximately 6000 Kg. Current on going trials include, devising a solution for the airdrop of soft stores (waters/rations) on Container Delivery System (<abbr title="Container Delivery System">CDS</abbr>) Small Boat Modular Platform (<abbr title="Small Boat Modular Platform">SBMP</abbr>) and 108” Platform Universal Rigid Inflatable Boat Aerial Delivery (<abbr title="Platform Universal Rigid Inflatable Boat Aerial Delivery">PURIBAD</abbr>).</p>

<p>Heavy drop has two main functions; to design and produce a Medium Platform Rigging Scheme (<abbr title="Medium Platform Rigging Scheme">MPRS</abbr>) for new vehicles entering service, and to ensure that any design changes to current in-service vehicles do not affect the equipments ability to be air dropped. The current platform used in heavy drop is the Medium Stressed Platform (<abbr title="Medium Stressed Platform">MSP</abbr>) which has been in service since 1953, it works on a Reefed Mains Extraction System with the main shock attenuation being airbags. </p>

<p>Data gathering equipment can be positioned on the vehicle and platform to measure the forces acting on the platform during extraction, parachute deployment and landing. Current on going trials include, Pinzgauer and trailer, Smooth Drum Roller and Jackal. </p>

<h3 id="publications">Publications</h3>

<p>On completions of the flight assessment, and sponsors (Hercules TriStar Project Team), acceptance the details are published in the following publications: AP101A-1102-1 Construction procedures for aerial delivery loads. AP101A-1106-1 Airdrop platforms and associated equipment. </p>

<h3 id="investigation-of-malfunctions">Investigation of malfunctions</h3>

<p>Representatives of Aerial Delivery Section are on 24 hour standby to cover all Malfunctions involving airdropped loads (MALDROP). Due to flight safety implications, MALDROP occurrences require investigation and subsequent action to prevent reoccurrence. AD Section provides ‘point of impact’ technical investigations on behalf of Air Command, all MALDROP reports are sent to HQ 2Gp in order to ascertain trends and actions accordingly. </p>

<h3 id="advice-to-external-agencies-1">Advice to external agencies</h3>

<p>In addition to routine trials work, Aerial Delivery Section provides advice to various Project Teams within <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support Agency">DE&amp;S</abbr>, and external agencies including QinetiQ and Boscombe Down, as well as civilian industry. The section also provides advice to and liaisons with other nations ranging from the Americans to the Norwegians.</p>

<h2 id="personnel-parachuting-test-team">Personnel Parachuting Test Team</h2>

<p>To undertake the developmental and operational test and evaluation of airborne forces equipment and to produce safe and tactically effective drills and procedures for its employment both in training and operations.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h3>

<p>Personnel Parachuting Test Team (<abbr title="Personnel Parachuting Test Team">PPTT</abbr>) at the <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> operates as the primary trials agency for airborne forces equipment for the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. </p>

<p>More specifically this relates to all personnel parachutes and the ancillary equipment used in support of the airborne task. <abbr title="Personnel Parachuting Test Team">PPTT</abbr> works in conjunction with the Aircraft Test and Evaluation Centre (<abbr title="Aircraft Test and Evaluation Centre">ATEC</abbr>) at Boscombe Down and with QinetiQ for the provision of developmental testing as tasked by the relevant Integrated Project Team (<abbr title="Integrated Project Team">IPT</abbr>). </p>

<p>These tasks are conducted under the auspices of a Combined Test Team in order to best utilise the appropriate skill sets available to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. Resulting from the developmental testing and, of course, inextricably linked to it, are the drills and procedures required for the introduction of tested equipment to the front line and this forms the start to finish philosophy and modus operandi of <abbr title="Personnel Parachuting Test Team">PPTT</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="conducting-trials">Conducting Trials</h3>

<p>Trials are conducted both under the auspices of the <abbr title="Aircraft Test and Evaluation Centre">ATEC</abbr> for developmental trials or within <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> procedures for Operational Test and Evaluation.  In both cases detailed trials plans and instructions are written to provide accurate and comprehensive trials. </p>

<h3 id="ground-assessment">Ground assessment</h3>

<p>Comprehensive ground assessments are undertaken to assess parachute configurations, the fitting, wearing and suitability of in-service ancillary equipment and weapons and above all, any safety implications which may affect the parachutist’s ability to operate the parachute.</p>

<h3 id="airborne-trials">Airborne trials</h3>

<p>Airborne trials are conducted at suitable Drop Zones (<abbr title="drop zones">DZ</abbr>) in the UK or more commonly, overseas, where better weather, unrestricted airspace, large <abbr title="drop zones">DZ</abbr> and dedicated aircraft make for a more successful trials environment. </p>

<p>During these live trial phases many descents are made, in a short period of time, day and night, from altitudes of 600ft (Static Line) to 36,000ft (Free Fall) above ground level. This concentration of descents enables continuity in the trial process thus ensuring nothing is missed. </p>

<p>These trials develop and confirm the necessary fitting, wearing and safe operation of the complete parachute configuration including ancillary equipment, checking and despatch procedures together with the appropriate aircraft dropping speeds, parachute opening heights and maximum operating heights. Instruments are used throughout the trial to measure forces acting on the parachutists and their equipment during the exit from the aircraft and the parachute deployment. </p>

<p>On completion of the practical trial work, a report is produced for the trial sponsor. Once accepted, by the sponsor any procedures and findings will be included in the appropriate Air Publications; these procedures are then used as the authorised service methods for the delivery of personnel by parachute systems.</p>

<h3 id="publications-1">Publications</h3>

<p>On completion of the practical trial work, the Section produces and publishes a report for the trial sponsor. Once accepted, the procedures specified will be included in the appropriate Air Publication, these procedures are then used as the authorised service methods for the delivery of personnel by parachute systems.</p>

<h3 id="investigation-of-malfunctions-1">Investigation of malfunctions</h3>

<p>Malfunctions involving personnel parachutes or parachutist’s equipment require investigation and subsequent action to prevent reoccurrence. Representatives of Personnel Parachuting Test Team, with their wealth of experience and vast knowledge of parachute systems are called upon to help with the investigation.</p>

<h3 id="advice-to-external-agencies-2">Advice to external agencies</h3>

<p>In addition to routine trials work, Personnel Parachuting Test Team provides advice to external agencies such as the <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support Agency">DE&amp;S</abbr>, the Survival and Airborne Delivery <abbr title="Integrated Project Team">IPT</abbr>, QinetiQ Boscombe Down and various civilian organisations. This also includes advice to and liaison with other nations.</p>

<h3 id="operational-tasks-1">Operational tasks</h3>

<p>During operational tasks there may be a requirement for airborne troops to deploy by air to the battlefield, with equipment that has not been tried, tested and endorsed by <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>. <abbr title="Personnel Parachuting Test Team">PPTT</abbr> can, and have been used in the past, to conduct an Urgent Operational Evaluation Program to clear the equipment for operational use only, at a later date the equipment undergoes the normal trials procedures.</p>

<h2 id="helicopter-section">Helicopter Section</h2>

<p>To enable the effective carriage of equipment and materiel as helicopter underslung loads in support of UK military commitments and provide advice on helicopter underslung load operations</p>

<h3 id="introduction-4">Introduction</h3>

<p><abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> Helicopter Section is responsible for the assessment and trial of all equipment that is to be underslung from UK military helicopters.</p>

<h3 id="initial-assessment-1">Initial assessment</h3>

<p>The process ideally begins at the design stage with the Section providing advice in conjunction with input from <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> Engineering Section, to the manufacturers of the equipment to be underslung. </p>

<p>When accepted for trial the equipment is subject to a full engineering assessment and airworthiness inspection. This is followed by the development of a suitable rigging scheme and static assessment beneath a gantry utilising instrumented slinging equipment. Once the design has been approved the equipment is presented for flight assessment.</p>

<h3 id="flight-assessment">Flight assessment</h3>

<p>The trial comprises of a number of elements designed to assess the characteristics of the underslung load under various flight configurations.  From this assessment the optimum speed, angle of bank and rate of descent at which the equipment can be safely flown is ascertained.</p>

<h3 id="publication">Publication</h3>

<p>On completion of the flight assessment and following sponsor acceptance of the results the details are published in the form of an Underslung Load Clearance (<abbr title="Underslung Load Clearance">USLC</abbr>) and published in Air Publication AP101A-1105-1B which is used throughout the military as the authorised method for the preparation and flying of the load.</p>

<h3 id="operational-tasks-2">Operational tasks</h3>

<p>In addition to conducting trials work Helicopter Section regularly deploys in support of operational tasks where there is a requirement to lift unique loads.</p>

<p>Other responsibilities include the recovery of downed aircraft and damaged vehicles that are inaccessible by other means.</p>

<h3 id="military-aid-to-the-civil-community-macc">Military Aid to the Civil Community (<abbr title="Military Aid to the Civil Community">MACC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The section may be called upon to provide support in times of crisis and disaster wherever helicopter underslung load operations are required.</p>

<h2 id="engineering-support-section">Engineering Support Section</h2>

<p>To design and fabricate prototype equipment and provide specialist airworthiness advice.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-5">Introduction</h3>

<p>Engineering Support Section provides specialist engineering support and airworthiness advice to all departments and customers at the <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>, as well as liaising with industry and <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support Agency">DE&amp;S</abbr> <abbr title="Integrated Project Teams">IPTs</abbr> on engineering specific issues. These often culminate in the production of prototype equipment to support a <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> trial. A joint service and civilian workforce man the section.</p>

<p>Headed by a Squadron Leader Aerosystems Engineer, it consists of three different sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Engineering Project Office</li>
  <li>Engineering Design Office (<abbr title="Engineering Design Office">EDO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Workshops</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engineering-project-officers">Engineering Project Officers</h3>

<p>The Section head and three Flight Lieutenant Aerosystems Engineers act as consultants to <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>’s lead sections, providing engineering advice, guidance on airworthiness requirements and regulations, and practical engineering experience. </p>

<p>This is normally the assessment of equipment’s structural integrity for flight as Helicopter Under-Slung loads, or as internal carriage in cargo aircraft.  The military engineering project officers also give experience of operational deployment and maintenance of equipment, providing knowledge of <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support Agency">DE&amp;S</abbr> equipment support procedures and a worldwide no-notice deployed engineering advice capability.  </p>

<p>To assist <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>’s Helicopter Section during recovery of downed aircraft and Military Aid to the Civil Authority (<abbr title="Military Aid to the Civil Authority">MACA</abbr>)/Military Aid to the Civil Community (<abbr title="Military Aid to the Civil Community">MACC</abbr>) tasks, engineering military project officers are trained as helicopter Landing Point Commanders enabling them to rig underslung loads for helicopter operations and command landing sites.</p>

<p>The civilian engineering project officer acts as subject matter expert for <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> engineering, providing in-depth knowledge of structural integrity calculations and testing, and trains the military staff upon their arrival at <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Information regarding engineering design information on helicopter underslung loads, can be found in the helicopter section. </p>

<h3 id="designers">Designers</h3>

<p>When <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>’s trials indicate that new support equipment is required to enable air transport of items, the <abbr title="Engineering Design Office">EDO</abbr> (comprising a Design Office Manager and 5 Engineering Designers) provides an in-house capability for the design, stress analysis and validation of such support equipment throughout the prototype development process. </p>

<p><abbr title="Engineering Design Office">EDO</abbr> tasks range from special to type dunnage for load spreading to complete Aerial Delivery systems. <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> is certified by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s <abbr title="Design Approval Organisation Scheme">DAOS</abbr> as competent to issue design certificates for the equipment it designs. </p>

<h2 id="history-of-joint-air-delivery-test-and-evaluation-unit">History of Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> has it origins in the Army’s Airborne Forces Development Centre (<abbr title="Airborne Forces Development Centre">AFDC</abbr>), located at Amesbury Abbey, and the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>’s Airborne Forces Tactical Development Unit (AFTDU) at Tarrant Rushton. These units were amalgamated into the Army Air Transport Development Unit (<abbr title="Air Transport Development Unit">ATDU</abbr>) located at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Abingdon.</p>

<p>In January 1968, the Joint Air Transport Establishment (<abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>) was formed with its headquarters at Old Sarum, Wiltshire which at the time was also the home of the Joint Warfare Establishment (<abbr title="Joint Warfare Establishment">JWE</abbr>) and the Army Air Transport Development Centre (<abbr title="Army Air Transport Development Centre">AATDC</abbr>). </p>

<p>The initial <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> Organisation was based on a consortium of 3 separate units, operating under the co-ordinated control of Headquarters <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>. The 3 units in question comprised of the Army’s long serving <abbr title="Army Air Transport Development Centre">AATDC</abbr>, AFTDU and a new organisation titled the Joint Helicopter Development Unit (<abbr title="Joint Helicopter Development Unit">JHDU</abbr>). </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Helicopter Development Unit">JHDU</abbr> added a Naval presence within the <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> organisation. There was a close link between <abbr title="Joint Warfare Establishment">JWE</abbr> and <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> with the post of <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> Commandant being combined with the Deputy Commandant at <abbr title="Joint Warfare Establishment">JWE</abbr>.</p>

<p>In 1970 the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> decided <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> should be based entirely at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Abingdon (the home of <abbr title="Air Transport Development Unit">ATDU</abbr>) and the close ties with <abbr title="Joint Warfare Establishment">JWE</abbr> ceased. </p>

<p>It was also decided that the main element of <abbr title="Joint Helicopter Development Unit">JHDU</abbr> should become independent of <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> and remain at Old Sarum under the new title of Joint Helicopter Tactical Development Unit (<abbr title="Joint Helicopter Tactical Development Unit">JHTDU</abbr>). </p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> retained 1 section, made up of personnel of <abbr title="Army Air Transport Development Centre">AATDC</abbr>’s Helicopter Section, concerned with helicopter underslung loads, internal load clearance work and techniques for carriage of troops by helicopter.</p>

<p>The move to Abingdon was completed in February 1973. In combination with the move, a more unified structure was introduced. The separate identities of <abbr title="Army Air Transport Development Centre">AATDC</abbr> and <abbr title="Air Transport Development Unit">ATDU</abbr> were formally discarded although the various sections remained identifiable with their earlier affiliations.</p>

<p>Under the new structure the sections comprised: Heavy Drop, Air Despatch, Airportability, Infantry/Signals and Training Sections (all ex-<abbr title="Army Air Transport Development Centre">AATDC</abbr>), together with Air Logistics and Aircraft Engineering Sections (<abbr title="Air Transport Development Unit">ATDU</abbr> background), Helicopter Section (<abbr title="Joint Helicopter Development Unit">JHDU</abbr>/<abbr title="Army Air Transport Development Centre">AATDC</abbr> background) Design Drawing Office (made up of personnel from both <abbr title="Army Air Transport Development Centre">AATDC</abbr> and <abbr title="Air Transport Development Unit">ATDU</abbr>) and Flying Section (Hercules aircraft) which was special to <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>.</p>

<p>As a result of a government defence review in 1974, it was decided to move <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> to <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Brize Norton. Thus on 31 December 1975 <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> HQ was formally established at its present site. </p>

<p>There was further restructuring with the merger of sections with common roles so leading to a more streamlined organisation with savings in manpower. Thus the Heavy Drop and Air Despatch Sections merged to form the Aerial Delivery Section and the Airportability and Logistics Sections merged under the title of Airportability Section. Infantry/Signals Section simply became Infantry Section,whilst retaining a signals specialist. </p>

<p>By the end of the 1970’s Aircraft Engineering shortened its title and became Engineering Section. At the same time the Infantry Section became the Airborne Trials Section, which reflected the type of work they specialised in.</p>

<p>In the 1990s a team appointed by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> completed a <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> study. One of the recommendations was that command of <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> should be moved from the Director of Commitments to the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Air Warfare Centre (AWC) under <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Strike Command.</p>

<p>This change occurred in April 1998 and <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>’s name also changed to reflect its position within the AWC becoming a evaluation unit instead of an establishment and <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> became <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr>.  As part of this reorganisation the <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> Flying Section left to become part of the Hercules Operational Evaluation Unit (<abbr title="Hercules Operational Evaluation Unit">HOEU</abbr>) at <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lyneham.</p>

<p>From the start of the 1980s until April 1998 the post of Commandant <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>, which used to rotate between <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> and Army, was provided by an Army Colonel and the post of Deputy Commandant was filled by a <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Wing Commander of the General Duties Flying Branch. </p>

<p>With the formation of <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr>, the Commandant became an Army Commanding Officer in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and the second in command became a <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Squadron Leader. </p>

<p>The announcement in 2004 that planning should commence for the closure of <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Lynham, project CATARA (Centralisation of Air Transport and Air Refueling Assets) has started the process of evaluating the move of assets to <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Brize Norton. </p>

<p>Thus, <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr> is actively participating in the planning which will see the Hercules transport fleet, the Hercules Operational Evaluation Unit (<abbr title="Hercules Operational Evaluation Unit">Herc OEU</abbr>) and 47 Air Despatch Squadron Royal Logistics Corp relocate to join <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr> at Brize Norton.</p>

<p>At present, the aspiration is to expand the <abbr title="Hercules Operational Evaluation Unit">Herc OEU</abbr> into a wider ranging Air Transport and Air to Air Refuelling (<abbr title="Air Transport and Air to Air Refuelling">ATAAR</abbr>) OEU [covering such aircraft as C17 and A400M] and to co-locate the new unit alongside <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="association-for-jadteu">Association for <abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Many units and squadrons have Associations, which enable past and current members to meet periodically, to enjoy social functions and to partake in visits to other units.</p>

<p>Some Associations have been in existence for many years and are extremely active. Early in 1999 a <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> committee was formed with the aim of determining the level of support amongst serving members for a <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> Association and the initial response was overwhelming. </p>

<p>The majority of serving members joined and the search is on to find former members and invite them to enrol as members of the <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> Association. </p>

<p>As part of their campaign to attract former members of <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr> and <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr> to the Association, the <abbr title="Joint Air Transport Establishment">JATE</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Transport Evaluation Unit">JATEU</abbr>/<abbr title="Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit">JADTEU</abbr> Association Committee (<abbr title="JATE/JATEU/JADTEU Association Committee">JAC</abbr>) placed advertisements in various military newspapers such as the Focus and Soldier. </p>
