  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Green taxes encourage businesses to reduce their energy use and emissions. There are different taxes and schemes designed for different kinds and size of business.</p>

<p>You may be able to get reliefs or be exempt from some taxes - for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you need to use a lot of energy because of the nature of your business</li>
  <li>if you’re a small business that doesn’t use much energy</li>
  <li>if you buy energy-efficient technology for your business</li>
</ul></article><article id="climate-change-levy"><header><h1>Part 2: Climate change levy</h1>
  </header><p>Climate change levy (<abbr title="Climate change levy">CCL</abbr>) encourages businesses to reduce their energy consumption or use energy from renewable sources. It’s a tax on:</p>

<ul>
<li>electricity</li>
  <li>gas</li>
  <li>solid fuels - like coal, lignite, coke and petroleum coke</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The levy is included in your energy bill. You can often see it listed as a separate item.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who it applies to</h2>
<p>You pay the tax if your business is in the following sectors: </p>

<ul>
<li>industrial</li>
  <li>commercial</li>
  <li>agricultural</li>
  <li>public</li>
  <li>services</li>
</ul>
<p>If your business only uses <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000181#P135_5771" title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs - 'De minimis' energy usage for climate change levy">small amounts of energy</a> it is treated as domestic and you don’t have to pay <abbr title="Climate change levy">CCL</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Getting an exemption</h2>

<p>Energy is normally exempt from <abbr title="Climate change levy">CCL</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it won’t be used in the UK</li>
  <li>it’s supplied to or from certain combined heat and power schemes</li>
  <li>it’s electricity that’s generated from renewable sources</li>
  <li>it’s used to produce electricity</li>
  <li>it won’t be used as fuel</li>
</ul>
<h2>Paying a reduced rate</h2>
<p>Some businesses get a reduction on the levy because they need to use a lot of energy in what they do - eg chemical industry businesses can get an 80% reduction. </p>

<p>Check if your business counts as <a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/emissions/ccas/eligibility/eligibility.aspx" title="Check which industries are energy intensive">energy intensive.</a></p>

<p>To qualify for the reduced rate, your business must meet energy-saving targets. Contact your industry trade association to find out more.</p>


</article><article id="crc-energy-efficiency-scheme"><header><h1>Part 3: CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme</h1>
  </header><p>The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (formerly known as the ‘Carbon Reduction Commitment’) covers large, non-energy-intensive organisations. They include organisations like:</p>

<ul>
<li>supermarkets</li>
  <li>hotels</li>
  <li>water companies</li>
  <li>banks</li>
  <li>local authorities, including state-funded schools</li>
  <li>all central government departments</li>
</ul>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>If your business qualifies for participation in the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, you should already be registered. You must now:</p>

<ul>
<li>monitor and report your CO2 emissions from gas and electricity use</li>
  <li>buy enough allowances to cover your annual emissions and surrender them at the end of the year</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further information</h2>
<p>Find out more about the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/126698.aspx" title="Environment Agency">Environment Agency</a> website.</p>

</article><article id="emissions-trading"><header><h1>Part 4: Emissions trading</h1>
  </header><p>The EU Emissions Trading System (<abbr title="European Union Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr>) affects businesses from energy-intensive sectors - like the energy industry and certain manufacturers. It lets you buy and sell greenhouse gas emission allowances to reduce your organisation’s environmental impact.</p>

<p>Read guidance note 3 to find out if your business sector is included.</p>

</div>

<p>Large organisations not covered by the <abbr title="European Union Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr> are covered by another scheme called the <a href="/green-taxes-and-reliefs/crc-energy-efficiency-scheme" title="CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme">CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>If your business is covered by the <abbr title="European Union Emissions Trading System">EU ETS</abbr> you must meet targets by:</p>

<ul>
<li>cutting your business emissions</li>
  <li>trading emissions allowances</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll need to <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/pollution/137172.aspx" title="Environment Agency (EU Registry)">open an EU Registry account</a> so you can trade allowances. You can then trade allowances by:</p>

<ul>
<li>trading directly with other businesses</li>
  <li>buying or selling from intermediaries, eg banks and specialist traders</li>
  <li>using the services of a broker</li>
  <li>joining one of the several exchanges that list carbon allowance products</li>
  <li>bidding at UK government or other EU member state auctions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Calculating your greenhouse gas emissions</h2>

<p>Calculate your greenhouse gas emissions by multiplying the amount of each type of energy you use by the emissions each type of energy produces.</p>

<p>To do this, you need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much non-renewable energy you’ve used - this information can be found on your gas, electricity and water bills, invoices and receipts</li>
  <li>the greenhouse gases produced by each type of energy (the ‘emission factor’) - these are updated every year</li>
</ul>

</article><article id="capital-allowances-on-energyefficient-items"><header><h1>Part 5: Capital allowances on energy-efficient items</h1>
  </header><p>When you buy energy efficient, or low or zero-carbon technology for your business, you can claim <a href="/green-technology-capital-allowances" title="Green technology: capital allowances">capital allowances</a>. This reduces the amount of tax you pay.</p>

</article><article id="landfill-tax"><header><h1>Part 6: Landfill tax</h1>
  </header><p>If your business gets rid of waste using landfill sites, you pay tax on top of your normal landfill fees. </p>

<h2>Landfill operators - what you must do</h2>
<p>You need a <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/netregs/63542.aspx" title="Environment Agency (Landfill site operators - permits and qualifications)">permit to operate a landfill.</a> You must also register with <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000509&amp;propertyType=document&amp;lang=_e#P948_80178" title="Register your landfill site with HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC)</a> within 30 days of setting up. If you don’t you can be fined.</p>

<h2>What to pay</h2>
<p>The tax is charged by weight. There are 2 rates. You pay the lower rate on ‘inactive waste’ - for example rocks or soil.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Rate</th>
      <th>Amount you pay</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Lower rate</td>
      <td>£2.50 per tonne</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Higher rate</td>
      <td>£64 per tonne</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>
<p>You don’t have to pay landfill tax on:</p>

<ul>
<li>dredging activities</li>
  <li>quarrying and mining</li>
  <li>pet cemeteries</li>
  <li>waste from the clean up of contaminated land</li>
  <li>inactive waste used for filling quarries</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get tax credits if you send waste for recycling, incineration or reuse. </p>

</article><article id="aggregates-levy"><header><h1>Part 7: Aggregates levy</h1>
  </header><p>This is a tax on sand, gravel and rock that is dug from the ground or dredged from the sea in UK waters.</p>

<h2>What you need to do</h2>
<p>If you exploit aggregate in the UK for commercial reasons, for example if you’re a quarry operator, you must <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_Forms&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_008354" title="Register with HMRC">register with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</a> </p>

<p>Every quarter, you must tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> the quantity of aggregates you have produced or sold.</p>

<h2>How much you pay</h2>
<p>You pay tax of £2.00 per tonne of sand, gravel or rock. You pay less on smaller amounts. For example, you’d pay £1.00 on half a tonne. You still pay tax if you import the materials. </p>

<h2>Reliefs</h2>
<p>You can get tax relief if you export aggregates or use them in a some industrial or agricultural processes. The key issue is whether or not the process is using the material as aggregate or not. It not, the aggregate is eligible for relief. Call the Excise helpline if you need more advice.</p>
