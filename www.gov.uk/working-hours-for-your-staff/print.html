</article><article id="calculating-working-hours-"><header><h1>Part 2: Calculating working hours </h1>
  </header><p>You must calculate the number of hours worked by your staff over a 17-week period by adding up the time worked during that time.</p>

<p>In your calculations you must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>work-related training</li>
  <li>travel by your staff as part for their day-to-day work, eg travelling to visit customers</li>
  <li>working lunches</li>
</ul>

<p>You can, with the agreement of your staff, work out their average hours over longer periods of time, eg up to 52 weeks.</p>

<p>Working time does not include commuting between their home and place of work, lunch breaks, evening classes or day-release courses.</p>


</article><article id="optingout-of-the-48hour-working-time-limit"><header><h1>Part 3: Opting-out of the 48-hour working time limit</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to give your staff the choice to work longer than the 48-hour per week limit, you must get them to sign a written opt-out agreement.</p>

<p>Your staff can cancel this opt-out arrangement as long as they give you at least 7 days’ notice.</p>

<h2>Mobile staff who can not opt out</h2>

<p>You must not allow the following staff to opt out of the 48-hour weekly working time limit:</p>

<ul>
<li>staff in the road transport industry, eg delivery drivers</li>

  <li>airline staff</li>
  <li>other staff who travel in and operate vehicles covered by EU rules on drivers’ hours, eg bus conductors</li>
  <li>security guards on a vehicle carrying high-value goods</li>

<ul>
<li>decide their own hours of work</li>
  <li>work a long way from home</li>
  <li>have to travel to different places for work</li>
