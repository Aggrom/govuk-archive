<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-scientific-advisory-council/about">Defence Scientific Advisory Council (DSAC)</a> provides independent advice to the Secretary of State for Defence on matters of concern to the Ministry of Defence in the fields of science, engineering, technology and analysis (<abbr title="science, engineering, technology and analysis">SETA</abbr>).</p>

<p>DSAC is a non-departmental public body (<abbr title="non-departmental public body">NDPB</abbr>) ie a body which has a role in the process of national government, but is not a government department or part of one. This means it can operate at ‘arm’s length’ from ministers. DSAC is an ‘Advisory <abbr title="non-departmental public body">NDPB</abbr>’, meaning that it advises ministers and does not employ staff or incur expenditure on its own account.</p>

<h2 id="mission-statement-vision-and-terms-of-reference">Mission statement, vision and terms of reference</h2>

<p>DSAC’s mission is to underpin the Defence Mission and Vision through the provision of authoritative independent advice to Secretary of State for Defence and senior MOD sponsors on non-nuclear <abbr title="science, engineering, technology and analysis">SETA</abbr> issues. Its vision is to be the benchmark for independent <abbr title="science, engineering, technology and analysis">SETA</abbr> advice to government.</p>

<h3 id="terms-of-reference">Terms of reference</h3>

<p>From a <abbr title="science, engineering, technology and analysis">SETA</abbr> perspective, DSAC will provide advice on:</p>

<ul>
<li>all aspects of the MOD research and development programme, including direction, content, exploitation, balance and changes, and value for money</li>
  <li>the use of <abbr title="science, engineering, technology and analysis">SETA</abbr> resources within MOD</li>
  <li>ways of achieving cross cutting capabilities, from conception to disposal and across all Defence Lines of Development;
operational issues</li>
  <li>ad-hoc issues, including broad strategic issues, priorities and policies internal to MOD and those that are external to, but will impact upon, MOD</li>
  <li>emerging external developments, innovation, opportunities and threats to MOD, both national and international</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst MOD and DSAC will work together to instigate studies in all these areas, DSAC should identify and drive the instigation of studies and reviews in the areas of research and <abbr title="science, engineering, technology and analysis">SETA</abbr> capability. DSAC should work with international partners where appropriate.</p>

<p>The Chairman of DSAC reports annually to the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>DSAC’s remit has evolved from its primary role of reviewing and advising the research programme to taking a more strategic view of all <abbr title="science, engineering, technology and analysis">SETA</abbr> aspects across MOD on behalf of the Secretary of State. DSAC does not provide scientific or technical advice to suppliers of research.</p>

<h2 id="dsac-organisation-roles-and-membership">DSAC organisation, roles and membership</h2>

<h3 id="the-dsac-secretariat">The DSAC Secretariat</h3>

<p>The Defence Science and Technology (<abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>) office provides the permanent Secretariat to support DSAC, and one of the senior members of staff is the Executive Officer of DSAC. The Secretariat is maintained by the <abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy Assurance and DSAC (<abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy AD) office. Further information can be obtained from: The Secretariat, <abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy AD, 01.M.14, MOD Main Building, Whitehall, London, SW1A 2HB Tel: 020 7218-7996; Fax: 020 7218-9678; or by <a href="mailto:DST-StrategyDSACOffice@mod.uk">emailing <abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy</a></p>

<h3 id="the-dsac-council">The DSAC Council</h3>

<p>Each council member champions 1 or more area of expertise, each area comprising of a network of academics and industrialists, who are experts in their own field, drawn from the Independent Science and Technology Advice (<abbr title="Independent Science and Technology Advice">ISTA</abbr>) register. The current areas of expertise are:</p>

<ul>
<li>RF engineering</li>
  <li>electro-optics Engineering</li>
  <li>signal and information processing</li>
  <li>network systems and architectures</li>
  <li>control system engineering</li>
  <li>civil and structural engineering</li>
  <li>electronic materials and devices</li>
  <li>structural and smart materials</li>
  <li>energetics</li>
  <li>chemistry</li>
  <li>biology</li>
  <li>medical science</li>
  <li>human and social sciences</li>
  <li>fluid dynamics</li>
  <li>operational analysis and mathematical modelling</li>
  <li>systems engineering and integration</li>
  <li>electrical engineering</li>
  <li>mechanical engineering and engineering science</li>
  <li>UAS and aeronautical engineering</li>
  <li>IT security and cyber</li>
</ul>
<p>These experts can be called on for specific tasks such as manning working parties (WPs) or audits. Council delivers most of its advice through reports produced by single-issue WPs, which disband on completion of their task. DSAC also organises Defence Science Seminars when it wishes to transmit a key message to a wider audience within MOD than may be reached by its usual reports.</p>

<p>All DSAC bodies (ie Council and WPs) are chaired by an independent member, but all have official members from MOD, and most have members from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence science and technology laboratories">Dstl</abbr>). A few also have members from the Meteorological Office, and from other government departments. </p>

<p>Council’s official members include the Science &amp; Technology Director and Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Equipment Capability).</p>

<p>All DSAC independent members are senior individuals recruited from academia and industry. </p>

<p>All are specialists in a branch of science, engineering, technology, or medicine of relevance to the Ministry of Defence. The primary role of the independent members is to provide independent, objective, timely, advice, based on their own knowledge and experience. </p>

<p>The principal roles of the MOD and other official members are to provide information about MOD’s current policies, programmes, plans, priorities, and problems to the independents, and to facilitate their contacts with appropriate MOD staff. DSAC working parties generally have secretaries, usually from <abbr title="Defence science and technology laboratories">Dstl</abbr>, to support the independent chairmen. <abbr title="Defence science and technology laboratories">Dstl</abbr> input to DSAC’s working parties is fully funded through the DSAC Secretariat.</p>

<h3 id="dsac-independents-status-security-and-disclosure-of-information">DSAC independents: status, security and disclosure of information</h3>

<p>All independent members of DSAC are appointed in a personal capacity, not as a representative of their employer or any other organisation. They are also security vetted to at least <abbr title="standard clearance">SC</abbr> before being appointed. This allows them regular and constant access to material up to (and including) Secret, and occasional access to Top Secret material. On appointment, all independent members sign a set of terms and conditions. This includes a statement that they may not disclose information received through membership of a DSAC body (eg Council, Board, working party, Register etc), to anyone who is not either a MOD employee, or another DSAC member, without the prior agreement of the body concerned and the DSAC Secretary (<abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy AD). The DSAC Secretary will seek advice from the relevant authority.</p>

<p>The independent members are appointed for a 3-year term, with the possibility of reappointment for a second 3-year term. Independent members are eligible to claim fees as follows: DSAC Chairman:£465/d; Council Members £380/d and Register Members: £321/d. </p>

<p>They may also claim travel and subsistence allowances for their DSAC activities. The DSAC Secretariat (through <abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy BC) processes their claims. </p>

<h2 id="code-of-practice">Code of practice</h2>

<h3 id="public-service-values">Public service values</h3>

<p>Members must at all times:</p>

<ul>
<li>observe the highest standards of impartiality, integrity and objectivity in relation to the advice they provide and the management of this public body</li>
  <li>be accountable to Parliament and the public more generally for its activities and for the standard of advice it provides</li>
  <li>comply fully with the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information</li>
</ul>
<p>The minister of the sponsoring department is answerable to Parliament for the policies and performance of this body, including the policy framework within which it operates.</p>

<h3 id="standards-in-public-life">Standards in Public Life</h3>

<p>All DSAC and <abbr title="Independent Science and Technology Advice">ISTA</abbr> register members must:</p>

<ul>
<li>follow the 7 Principles of Public Life set out by the Committee on Standards in Public Life</li>
  <li>comply with this code, and ensure they understand their duties, rights and responsibilities, and that they are familiar with the function and role of this body and any relevant statements of government policy</li>
  <li>not misuse information gained in the course of their public service for personal gain or for political purpose, nor seek to use the opportunity of public service to promote their private interests or those of connected persons, firms, businesses or other organisations</li>
  <li>not hold any paid or high-profile unpaid posts in a political party, and not engage in specific political activities on matters directly affecting the work of this body - when engaging in other political activities, board members should be conscious of their public role and exercise proper discretion</li>
</ul>
<p>These restrictions do not apply to MPs (in those cases where MPs are eligible to be appointed), to local councillors, or to Peers in relation to their conduct in the House of Lords.</p>

<h3 id="role-of-dsac-members">Role of DSAC Members</h3>

<p>Members of DSAC have collective responsibility for the operation of this body. They must:</p>

<ul>
<li>engage fully in collective consideration of the issues, taking account of the full range of relevant factors, including any guidance issued by the sponsor department or the responsible minister</li>
  <li>adhere to the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (including prompt responses to public requests for information) and agree an Annual Report</li>
  <li>respond appropriately to complaints, if necessary with reference to the sponsor department</li>
  <li>ensure that council does not exceed its powers or functions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Communications between DSAC members and the minister will generally be through the Chairman of Council. Nevertheless, any DSAC member has the right of access to ministers on any matter that he or she believes raises important issues relating to his or her duties as a DSAC member. In such cases the agreement of the Chairman of Council should normally be sought. </p>

<p>Individual members can normally be removed from office by the minister, or the Chairman of Council if they fail to perform the duties required of them in line with the standards expected in public office.</p>

<h2 id="dsac-secretariat">DSAC Secretariat</h2>

<p>The DSAC Secretariat function is carried out by the Defence Science and Technology Strategy (<abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy) office in MOD: </p>

Email: <a href="mailto:DST-StrategyDSACOffice@mod.uk"><abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy</a></p>

<p>The DSAC secretariat is maintained by the office for Defence Science and Technology (<abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>) Strategy, which provides secretarial support for the Council and its subordinate bodies. The office also maintains a register of Independent Members, undertaking the payment of Fees and Travel and Subsistence claims and ensuring Security Clearance is up to date. Any enquiries regarding DSAC and its operation should be directed to the <abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr>-Strategy AD office.</p>

<p>The following forms are part of the DSAC Pack. <abbr title="Defence science and technology">DST</abbr> can supply these on request and all new members are sent a complete pack when a working party is established.</p>

<ul>
<li>travel and subsistence rates</li>
  <li>MOD Form 382 (travel and subsistence claim form)</li>
  <li>income tax form</li>
  <li>public disclosure</li>
  <li>a guidance note for working party members on document, fax and internet security</li>
  <li>a claim verification form (to be signed by the working party chairman to ensure speedy processing of claims)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-aims-of-dsac-working-parties">General aims of DSAC working parties</h2>

<p>DSAC’s remit has evolved from its primary role of reviewing and advising the research programme to taking a more strategic view of all S&amp;T aspects across MOD. This is reflected in the terms of reference (paragraph 6 of ‘Defence Scientific Advisory Council Background Information’).</p>

<h3 id="the-independence-of-dsacs-advice">The independence of DSAC’s advice</h3>

<p>All DSAC’s advice should be truly independent. Therefore working party reports should not merely reflect the views of official members. To help guard against this, DSAC bodies usually have at least 1 more independent member than official. Where irreconcilable differences arise between the views of independents and officials, the Chairman should ensure that the working party’s report and recommendations reflects the views of the independents. He or she should, however, also ensure that officials are given the opportunity to dissociate themselves from the contentious parts by writing a ‘minority report’ or annex setting out their position.</p>

<h3 id="working-parties-to-review-the-existing-research-programme">Working parties to review the existing research programme</h3>

<p>Some DSAC working parties will have the aim of reviewing a part of the defence research programme. The working parties should normally carry out relevant activities from the following ‘menu’:</p>

<ul>
<li>a review of the relevance of the research programme to military (ie customer) needs</li>
  <li>a review of the scope and content of the research programme in order to identify gaps or areas of duplication</li>
  <li>a review of the scientific quality of the work</li>
  <li>a review of the existence or absence of related/relevant work in the HEIs or in industry</li>
  <li>an assessment of the likelihood of success of specific programmes, based on an analysis of the key technical challenges and the prospects for making progress in a sensible time, and for an affordable investment</li>
  <li>a commentary on the co-ordination of research across MOD’s research suppliers</li>
  <li>an assessment of the opportunities for beneficial international collaboration</li>

<p>A working party should always do more than summarise MOD activity in the particular area it is addressing. It should add its own, independent comments, and, of crucial importance to DSAC’s success and value to MOD, they should always reach definite conclusions and produce clear recommendations.</p>

<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

<p>DSAC studies need to make an impact. Each study has a senior MOD sponsor of at least 2* level, and there are always a number of important senior stakeholders. The output from the study to sponsors and stakeholders is a summary report of around 10 pages that highlight the main findings and provides recommendations that are assigned to the appropriate MOD personnel. Supporting data for the study will be held by the DSAC Secretariat.</p>

<p>MoD are asked to respond and stakeholders are asked to provide a general response to the report within 4 weeks, with a follow-up response in 6 months providing details on how recommendations have been addressed.</p>

<h3 id="recommendations-on-funding">Recommendations on funding</h3>

<p>Carrying out the activities described above will often give rise to recommendations on future funding of research in the areas covered by the working party. It is entirely within DSAC’s remit to make such recommendations.</p>

<p>It is likely that working parties will often produce recommendations for increased funding. However MOD’s research budget is falling, so increased funding in 1 area of research can only occur if funding for another area is reduced. In consequence, DSAC working parties are urged to identify parts of the programme, related to the area of their review, where the independent members feel MOD research funding can safely be reduced. They might reach such a recommendation because:</p>

<ul>
<li>they believe the research is unlikely to meet the military need;</li>
  <li>they judge that the specific programme is likely to fail to make progress in a sensible time and for an affordable investment;</li>
  <li>they are aware of related/relevant work in industry, the HEIs, or elsewhere;</li>
  <li>they have identified new technological developments that they believe will make parts of the existing programme redundant or in need of re-focusing</li>
</ul>
<p>Such advice is especially valued by the MOD research customers.</p>

<h2 id="role-of-independent-members-of-dsac">Role of independent members of DSAC</h2>

<p>This information on the roles and responsibilities of independent members of DSAC and the <abbr title="Independent Science and Technology Advice">ISTA</abbr> register members that support DSAC is intended to be read by all existing independent members of DSAC, all new independent recruits, and any official who seeks guidance or clarification on the issue.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

<p>Independent members are recognised specialists and experts in science, engineering, technology, or medicine who are appointed to provide independent advice to the Secretary of State for Defence. None work in MOD or its agencies, and their main employer is usually academia, industry, or the NHS/Department of Health.</p>

<p>The other type of member is an official member. These are staff from MOD or <abbr title="Defence science and technology laboratories">Dstl</abbr> (or occasionally another government department) whose main role is to provide the information about MOD and <abbr title="Defence science and technology laboratories">Dstl</abbr>, and their activities, which the independents need to generate relevant advice.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-meant-by-independence">What is meant by independence?</h3>

<p>Independent members are appointed in a personal capacity, because of their individual knowledge and expertise. They are not appointed because of any job or position, which they hold. Their advice should reflect the personal nature of their appointment: it should be based on their personal views, as experts, of what is best for the MOD. Their advice should not represent the interests of their employers or any other organisation.</p>

<p>An attempt by an independent member to use his or her position to lobby for his employer’s interest could damage DSAC’s reputation for independence, and thereby weaken its effectiveness.</p>

<p>MOD regards DSAC and <abbr title="Independent Science and Technology Advice">ISTA</abbr> members as their trusted advisers and provides information to DSAC which it does not release to a wider industrial and academic audience. As a corollary, MOD expects them members to remember that they are appointed in a personal capacity, and to recognise that all information is released to them as individuals, not as representatives of their employers. In consequence, information given to DSAC and its members should not be passed on to anyone not in MOD or its agencies, DSAC or on the <abbr title="Independent Science and Technology Advice">ISTA</abbr> register. </p>

<p>The DSAC Chairman will treat any reported breach of this confidence extremely seriously, and will expect the member concerned to resign from DSAC and the register.</p>

<h3 id="roles-of-independents-and-the-nature-and-status-of-their-advice">Roles of independents, and the nature and status of their advice</h3>

<p>The role of the independent members is to generate advice, by combining their own specialist knowledge and experience with information provided by officials on MOD’s policies, plans, priorities, programmes, procedures, problems and the ‘politics’ associated with the issues being addressed.</p>

<p>Their advice will, in most cases, take the form of recommendations produced by working parties set up to address a particular issue or by joint DSAC/MOD Audits. Working party reports have to be endorsed by Council before being passed to MOD.</p>

<p>Formally, DSAC advises the Secretary of State for Defence, and the DSAC Chairman reports DSAC’s key recommendations to him. However, most of DSAC’s detailed recommendations are sent directly to the customers for MOD’s research programme, and MOD’s response comes back from them.</p>

<p>A proportion of DSAC’s activities are carried out at the specific request of MOD’s Chief Scientific Adviser (<abbr title="Chief Scientific Adviser">CSA</abbr>). Advice produced by these working parties does not constitute advice to ministers, and so it may, in some cases, with the permission of <abbr title="Chief Scientific Adviser">CSA</abbr>, be possible for their reports to be circulated outside government. <abbr title="Chief Scientific Adviser">CSA</abbr> may of course also use them as the basis of his advice to ministers.</p>

<p>DSAC’s principal role is to advise the MOD research customer, not the scientists in <abbr title="Defence science and technology laboratories">Dstl</abbr> or other suppliers carrying out the research. However, much of DSAC’s advice will be generated following contact with such scientists, and all involved recognise the value to the suppliers of research of such contacts. However, advising suppliers on the scientific issues involved in a part of the research programme should not become the principal activity of any DSAC working party.</p>

<p>DSAC’s role is to advise on the scope, content, health, and balance of MOD’s scientific activities. MOD should not use DSAC as consultants to solve specific technical problems, or to deal with issues which should properly be addressed by officials. The distinction between advice and consultancy is at times a fine one, but any independent member, or working party, who feels that they are being asked by MOD or <abbr title="Defence science and technology laboratories">Dstl</abbr> to carry out activities which should more properly be done by consultants from the commercial sector should not hesitate to raise their concerns with the DSAC Secretary or Executive Officer.</p>

<p>DSAC is an advisory body. It has no executive function or authority within MOD. The style and tone of its reports and recommendations should reflect its status as a high-level advisory group.</p>
