<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation requires that imported organic food from third countries be produced to the same standards as that from the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Until third country producers and processors are registered with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-approved organic control body, imports authorised by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) from these countries are also permitted. Seeds, animal feedstuffs and unprocessed cotton are also subject to the import controls for organic produce.</p>

<p>You can import organic produce without authorisation and sell it as organic if it is from within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, European Economic Area (EEA) or from Switzerland and is produced or processed by an operator registered with an approved <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic control body.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-to-import-organic-produce">Preparing to import organic produce</h2>

<p>Importers of organic products from countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must work to certain European Community regulations.</p>

<h3 id="registration-in-the-uk-as-an-organic-food-importer">Registration in the UK as an organic food importer</h3>

<p>If you intend to import a product and sell it as organic you will have to comply with both organic and general consumer food laws. All organic food must come from growers, processors or importers who are registered and subject to regular inspection.</p>

<p>You can import organic foods into the UK from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and sell them as organic as long as they have been produced or processed by a company that is registered with an approved organic control body within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must register with an organic control body if you produce, prepare, store, import from a third country or market organic products. There are certain exemptions for those who purely retail (including storage only in connection with the point of sale) and for caterers.</p>

<p>You must present evidence of your registration to <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> when you apply for an import authorisation.  See <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/growing/organic/standards/certbodies/approved.htm">the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a> </p>

<p>Production rules and inspection systems in certain countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are deemed equivalent to those in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. As long as the products you import are produced in one of these named countries and meet certain conditions you can import them and sell them as organic without getting approval first. </p>

<h2 id="apply-for-organic-import-authorisation">Apply for organic import authorisation</h2>

<p>Three categories of organic goods can be imported from a third country into the UK or another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state without an import authorisation provided they come from an exporter controlled by:</p>

<ul>
<li>a recognised control body in the countries deemed by the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) to be <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-equivalent third countries</li>
  <li>a listed control body recognised by the Commission as applying standards equivalent to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic standards in specified third countries </li>
  <li>a listed control body recognised by the Commission as applying <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic standards in specified third countries</li>
</ul>
<p>If the country from which you intend to import an organic product does not fit into any of the above categories you must have an authorisation issued by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> or another member state before you import any products. This will gradually fall away as the Commission recognises the organic production rules and systems of inspection of third countries as being equivalent to those in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>All consignments of organic produce imported from a third country into a member state must be accompanied by a Certificate of Inspection that is issued by a certification body in the country of origin. </p>

<h3 id="import-organic-productsfrom-the-eu">Import organic products from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You can import produce from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> into the UK and sell it freely as organic provided it is produced or processed in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by an operator registered with an approved <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic certification body. You may, however, need to be certified as an organic processor if you store the goods in bulk, carry out further processing and/or repackage the organic products in the UK. </p>

<p>If your business will be importing organic products (including plants, plant products, livestock, livestock products, or any other food made from these products including animal feed and entirely unprocessed agricultural products) from another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state you don’t need to be registered/certified for importing and an import authorisation is not needed. </p>

<p>This is because <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s equivalents in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states ensure that their organic inspection/certification bodies are working to the same <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulation as is applied in the UK. You can <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/c_016/c_01620050120en00010020.pdf">download a list of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certification bodies from the Europa website (PDF, 90KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Organic produce grown in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and pre-packaged products produced in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must meet prescribed labelling and marketing requirements. </p>

<h3 id="import-organic-products-from-equivalent-third-countries">Import organic products from ‘equivalent’ third countries</h3>

<p>Nine non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries have equivalence status, which means that your business can import organic produce from them without authorisation from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> as their organic regimes are recognised as being on a par with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic regimes. The current list includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Argentina</li>
  <li>Australia</li>
  <li>Canada</li>
  <li>Costa Rica</li>
  <li>India</li>
  <li>Israel</li>
  <li>Japan</li>
  <li>New Zealand</li>
  <li>Switzerland</li>
  <li>Tunisia</li>
</ul>
<p>While you do not need to apply for authorisation to import organic goods from the above countries you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be certified by one of the UK organic certifying bodies </li>
  <li>present a Certificate of Inspection to the port health authority (<abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr>) for endorsement</li>
  <li>check whether any temporary or emergency measures affect import controls, tests and/or documentation from a particular country or for a particular product/s - eg produce from certain areas of Japan following the nuclear incident in March 2011</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="import-organic-products-from-non-equivalent-third-countries">Import organic products from ‘non-equivalent’ third countries</h3>

<p>If your business is to import from other third countries (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and non-equivalent) you need to be registered/certified with one of the UK organic certifying authorities.</p>

<p>You must also hold an import authorisation from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> for the product concerned.</p>

<p>To gain your organic import authorisation from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> you’re required to complete form OB11 - an initial application to market in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic products from third countries. You can complete the form on screen or you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/files/ob11.pdf">download form OB11 from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 340K)</a>.</p>

<p>In assessing your OB11 application <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will ensure that the organic products being imported into the UK from a third country are certified by an organic inspection/control body that meets the requirements of IS065/EN45011 and is recognised by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> or other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states for their work. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will want to see evidence, largely in the form of operators’ certificates, that standards equivalent to Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) No 834/2007 have been applied at all stages.</p>

<p>The OB11 application can be completed by the third country’s inspection body on your behalf. Applications where the importer has sought the help of the third country inspection body tend to be more successful. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will assess the OB11 within ten working days. It’s important to note that products shouldn’t be imported from non-equivalent third countries before an import authorisation has been secured.</p>

<p>Your authorisation must be renewed annually.</p>

<h2 id="certificate-of-inspection-and-other-import-documents-for-organic-produce">Certificate of inspection and other import documents for organic produce</h2>

<p>All organic produce imported into the UK must be accompanied by the correct documentation to allow the port authority to verify your shipment and for it to be allowed into free circulation.</p>

<h3 id="certificate-of-inspection">Certificate of Inspection</h3>

<p>The key regulation when importing organic products into the UK from countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the EEA requires that a Certificate of Inspection (<abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>) be produced by the inspection body in the third country from which your imported goods originate. You should then present the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> to the relevant authority in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. In the UK this body would usually be the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> or local authority at the port of arrival. </p>

<p>It can also be a place other than where a consignment first enters <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> territory and from which you seek release for free circulation in the Community.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> confirms its validity the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> will be endorsed in box 17 before the goods can go to customs for final clearance to move into free circulation.</p>

<p>There is a charge of £45 for checking and endorsement of the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If products are being imported by airfreight, a photocopy of the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> is permitted for temporary endorsement (in the UK only). In these cases the original must be presented to the port within a week.</p>

<h3 id="coi-for-goods-from-equivalence-countries">
<abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> for goods from equivalence countries</h3>

<p>If appropriate the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> will be endorsed before the goods go to customs for final clearance to move into free circulation.</p>

<p>The original <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> must be presented and endorsed in box 17 by the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> or local authority before organic goods will be permitted to move to customs clearance. If products are being imported by airfreight a photocopy of the certificate is permitted for temporary endorsement (in the UK only). In these cases the original must be presented to the port within a week.</p>

<p>There is also a requirement that importers pre-notify the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> of the arrival of goods. Each port has its own form of pre-notification. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.porthealth.co.uk/port_directory.php">find a list of port contact details on the Association of Port Health Authorities website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-of-coi">Extract of <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> is the general document that must be made available to the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> or local authority. However, if you intend to split a larger consignment into smaller units you must ensure that your certificate has been verified and endorsed beforehand. When your consignment is split the divided shipments should be accompanied by an Extract of the Certificate of Inspection, as this will allow customs clearance. All verification and endorsement will be carried out by the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr>/local authority.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-coi">Problems with <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>When your consignment arrives at the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>, if presented, will be inspected. If this inspection fails your goods won’t be allowed into free circulation and your <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> won’t be stamped. There are a number of reasons why this might happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>the original <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> not being present when the consignment arrives</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> isn’t written in English</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> hasn’t been fully completed</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> hasn’t been signed and stamped in Box 15</li>
  <li>uncertified amendments have been made to the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the information on the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> doesn’t match the information on <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s organic imports database</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> has been completed by the wrong certifying body - for products from approved status countries - or has the wrong inspection body mentioned</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s likely that for very minor errors on the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> (eg a small spelling error), matters can be resolved by the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> making an amendment. The <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> may wish to discuss these cases with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> officials. In the event that minor corrections are made they must be clearly endorsed with a <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> stamp and an authorised signature.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> can’t be endorsed for whatever reason you can still move your goods into free circulation as long as you remove all indication that they’re organic. If repackaging is needed you may be able to get permission to move your consignment to suitable premises for this process to be carried out. These premises will still be under customs control.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-consignments">Problems with consignments</h3>

<p>In some circumstances concerns may be raised by Port Health Officers about the consignment itself and not necessarily about the documentation. Often, the quantities in the consignment don’t match those stated on the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>. If the quantities of the consignment are greater than those stated on your documentation the consignment will be held.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the quantities in your consignment are lower than stated on your documentation, the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> may endorse the <abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr> with the appropriate alteration.</p>

<p>If the problems with your consignment can’t be resolved a Movement Control Order will be issued and your consignment will be marked to show that it’s under the control order. The notice will give details of the steps that have to be taken to bring your consignment to a state whereby your certificate can be endorsed, allowing your goods to proceed to customs clearance. You have the right to appeal any Movement Control Order. This should be directed to the official at the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr> you’re using.</p>

<h2 id="other-regulations-affecting-organic-importers">Other regulations affecting organic importers</h2>

<p>As well as legislation relating specifically to organic production and marketing, organic operators must comply with general and food safety regulations. Where there is a conflict the general regulation takes precedence over the organic requirement even where this will result in the product losing its organic status.</p>

<h3 id="general-food-regulations">General food regulations</h3>

<p>When importing food you need to comply with general food safety regulations. You can <a rel="external" href="http://food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports/">find an overview of the legislation for importing food on the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>You must also comply with a number of food hygiene regulations affecting anyone who trades within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/regulation/europeleg/eufoodhygieneleg/">find out more on the <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>If your business imports live animals or products of animal origin a number of special rules apply. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">see an overview of the rules on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You may also require a special licence. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/forms/?s=licence">find out more on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>In most cases you’ll need a Certificate of Veterinary Clearance which you can obtain from the <abbr title="Port Health Authority">PHA</abbr>. See the guide on overseas veterinary certificates and Border Inspection Posts</p>

<h3 id="general-import-registration-documentation-and-procedures">General import registration, documentation and procedures</h3>

<p>In addition to the Certificate of Inspection, which attests to the conformity with organic standards of your products, your imports are also subject to standard import procedures.</p>

<p>You can find information relevant to the food sector in the section on [food and agriculture]</p>

<h2 id="certificate-of-conformity-and-peach">Certificate of conformity and <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If your business imports organic fresh fruit, vegetables or nuts from any country outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must use the Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates (<abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>) from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate, to ensure compliance with horticulture and marketing standards. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/">Use the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> system to import plants and fresh produce</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="shipping-documents-and-systems">Shipping documents and systems</h3>

<p>One of the most important documents that must accompany all your consignments is your invoice, containing as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
<li>the goods description</li>
  <li>weight (in kilograms)</li>
  <li>price</li>
  <li>country of origin</li>
  <li>signature and date</li>
</ul>
<p>Some countries you ship to will have special requirements for the layout of invoices. A freight forwarder or your International Trade Team will be able to advise you.</p>

<p>The Single Administrative Document (or form C88) should accompany your invoice, and Certificate of Inspection (if one is required). This is commonly used for importing goods from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. You’ll also need to check which other documents your consignments may need. Your consignments will also require a Standard Shipping Note (<abbr title="Standard Shipping Note">SSN</abbr>), if arriving by sea. </p>

<p>All of your import documentation must contain the Commodity Code. This is a ten digit number that describes the items in your consignment. Each Commodity Code has a rate of duty allocated to it. Any restrictions or licences are also listed against each Commodity Code in the Tariff. You can find out about Commodity Codes in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">classification rules and the Tariff</a>.</p>

<p>Customs Handling of Imports and Exports Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Imports and Exports Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) is an electronic system which tracks the movement of imported and exported goods travelling by land, sea or air. All of your imports will come into contact with the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Imports and Exports Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system so it’s imperative that you or your agent understand how it works. </p>

<p>See the guide on Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (CFSP) . You can also <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageTravel_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000188&amp;propertyType=document">find out about <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) website</a>.</p>
