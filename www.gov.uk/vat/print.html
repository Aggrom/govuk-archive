<h2>How <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is worked out</h2>

<p>When someone charges you <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> they multiply their selling price by the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> rate to calculate the amount of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> to charge. </p>

<p>They then add this to the selling price to give you the price you actually pay - this is called the ‘gross’ price.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> fraud</h2>

<p>If a businesses doesn’t have a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number they’re not registered for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and must not charge  <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/vieshome.do?selectedLanguage=EN" title="Check a UK VAT number" rel="external">check a UK <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number</a> is valid and <a href="/report-vat-fraud" title="Report VAT fraud">report <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> fraud</a> online.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="where-you-see-vat"><header><h1>Part 2: Where you see VAT</h1>
  </header><h2>In shops</h2>

<p>If <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is due on something you buy in a shop it’s already included in the price. No tax is added when you pay.</p>

<h2>In adverts, catalogues and price lists</h2>

<p>This depends on who they’re aimed at:</p>

<ul>
<li>if they’re for the general public only, they’ll show you a price including <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if they’re aimed at businesses as well as consumers, they might show the price with <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and without</li>
  <li>prices aimed at businesses only don’t usually include <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, which is charged on top of the price shown</li>
</ul>
<h2>On bills and receipts</h2>

<p>Sometimes <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is shown on a separate line. This doesn’t mean you’re paying extra - it just shows how much tax is included in the price.</p>

<p>Invoices from suppliers like builders, painters and decorators must show a separate amount for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registration number.</p>

<h2>Tax free shopping</h2>

<p>Visitors to the UK or EU residents leaving the EU for 12 months or more can sometimes get <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/sectors/consumers/overseas-visitors.htm" title="VAT refunds for visitors to the UK"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> refunds.</a> If the retailer offers tax free shopping they’ll give you a customs form and explain how.  </p>
