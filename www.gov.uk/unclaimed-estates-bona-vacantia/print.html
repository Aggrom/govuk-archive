  </header><p>When someone dies with no will or known family, their property passes to the Crown as ownerless property (or ‘bona vacantia’) . It can be any kind of property, like buildings, money or personal possessions.</p>

<p>If you’re a relative, you could be entitled to a share of a deceased relative’s property (‘estate’).</p>
