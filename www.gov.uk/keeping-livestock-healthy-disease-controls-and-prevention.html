<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a farmer, you have a duty to prevent the spread of disease - between animals, from animals to humans, and from humans to animals. Some diseases are classified as notifiable, which means that if you suspect an animal has one of these diseases you must inform your Animal Health Office (<abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>) immediately.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local Animal Health Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This guide explains how you can use hygiene, biosecurity and farm health planning measures to prevent the spread of animal disease. It also details when, how and who you must notify. You can read about restrictions and disease controls you must implement, such as protecting your workers, designating affected premises, setting up protection and surveillance zones, and controls on livestock movements. You will also find out how to deal with fallen stock and limit the impact through preventative and control measures.</p>

<h2 id="controls-on-animal-diseases">Controls on animal diseases</h2>

<p>Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) is an executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>). It was formed in 2011 following a merger of Animal Health and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Veterinary Laboratories Agency">VLA</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>’s key role is to safeguard public and animal health and welfare, protect the economy and enhance food security through research, surveillance and inspection.</p>

<p>They work to prevent and control animal disease across the UK through activities on farms, at markets and other livestock-related premises, and through specialist veterinary laboratory and scientific services. Their range of functions include research and consultancy, and the surveillance and management of disease controls. They also have reference laboratory responsibilities for certain exotic and zoonotic diseases, and maintain a key capability to respond to animal disease emergencies.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local Animal Health Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>The Animal Health Act 1981 regulates the prevention, control and eradication of animal diseases. It provides emergency powers to respond to the outbreak of exotic diseases and covers aspects of disease control, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>eradicating and preventing disease</li>
  <li>dealing with an outbreak of disease</li>
  <li>powers of entry - for veterinary inspectors and officers of the minister</li>
  <li>seizure of infected animals</li>
  <li>slaughter and compensation</li>
  <li>disposal of infected carcases</li>
  <li>cleansing and movement of animals, personnel and vehicles</li>
  <li>empowerment of local authorities and enforcement</li>
</ul>
<p>Disease in animals can spread through any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>movement of animals, people and machinery between or within farms</li>
  <li>farm visitors - people and vehicles</li>
  <li>introduction of new animals</li>
  <li>contact with neighbours’ livestock</li>
  <li>shared farm equipment</li>
  <li>contamination by vermin and wild birds</li>
  <li>animals drinking from contaminated rivers and streams</li>
</ul>
<p>You must ensure employees and the public are safe if they are at risk of infection from exposure to notifiable diseases. However, livestock disease is not the only risk to employees and the public on farms. </p>

<p>Specific rules also apply to species of animals. </p>

<h3 id="your-duty-to-report-some-farm-diseases">Your duty to report some farm diseases</h3>

<p>It is your duty to prevent the spread of disease by immediately informing your <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> if you suspect a notifiable disease. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local Animal Health Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="animal-health-rules-at-markets-and-shows">Animal health rules at markets and shows</h3>

<p>Under the Animal Gatherings Order 2010, a general licence is required for any livestock gathering - eg markets and shows - alongside the industry’s commitment to best practice. You can <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/publications/advice-guidance/documents/AH-AnimalGathering-DL.pdf">download brief guidance on biosecurity at animal gatherings from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 788K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance-rules">Cross Compliance rules</h3>

<p>Cross Compliance requirements apply to you if you receive direct payments under Common Agricultural Policy support schemes or certain Rural Development schemes. To receive your full subsidy payment you must comply with the Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>) and standards of good agricultural and environmental condition requirements that apply to your business.</p>

<p>Several <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> apply to disease prevention and control, including <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 12, 13, 14 and 15 for the prevention and control of animal disease.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/e56cb88ac816cfbc802573aa0051f098/%24FILE/SMR%2012%202012%20v1.0.pdf">download information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMR</abbr> 12 - prevention and control of TSEs from the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website (PDF, 652K)</a>.</p>

<p>If you don’t carry out your <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMR</abbr> obligations, you may face enforcement action and even prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="controls-of-meat-during-a-disease-outbreak">Controls of meat during a disease outbreak</h3>

<p>Fresh meat products are subject to special controls during outbreaks of animal diseases, under the Products of Animal Origin (Disease Control) (England) Regulations 2008. Rules cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>African swine fever</li>
  <li>classical swine fever</li>
  <li>Newcastle disease</li>
  <li>peste des petits ruminants (sheep and goat plague)</li>
  <li>rinderpest</li>
  <li>swine vesicular disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Separate rules apply to foot and mouth disease and avian influenza.</p>

<p>Animal Health officers can designate premises as affected by disease. Alternatively, the food business operator - the person responsible for compliance with the requirements of food laws - can apply for a designation. Meat from establishments where a disease outbreak is suspected or confirmed may not enter the human food chain and must be disposed of by slaughterhouses as Category 2 high-risk animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>).</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/control/meat/pzsz.htm">Find out about regulations governing the treatment and movement of restricted meat on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="controls-of-milk-during-a-disease-outbreak">Controls of milk during a disease outbreak</h3>

<p>During disease outbreaks, milk and milk products from affected areas cannot be sold for human consumption or exported. If cattle show signs of disease, their milk and milk products must be treated and disposed of as Category 2 high-risk <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>. The products must be collected and transported in leak-proof covered vehicles and kept separately from other <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="controls-following-a-disease-outbreak">Controls following a disease outbreak</h3>

<p>Detailed rules apply to treatment of dead animals and buying new stock. </p>

<p>Limits to moving people, livestock and birds will probably also apply, as well as controls to your farm premises and staff, and restrictions on travel through the local countryside after an outbreak. </p>

<h2 id="animal-disease-detection-and-diagnosis">Animal disease detection and diagnosis</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> aims to protect public and animal health by detecting and diagnosing farm animal diseases. This is done through a range of tests on samples carried out at its laboratories across the country.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> offers specialist testing services on farmed animal samples in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>parasitology - these tests cover a range of parasites from various animal species</li>
  <li>microbiology and virology - these tests search for the presence of micro-organisms and viruses in samples from cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, birds and horses</li>
  <li>serology - these blood tests cover the analysis of blood serum of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, birds and horses</li>
  <li>other tests including necropsies, abortions and stillborns, and milk tests</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://vla.defra.gov.uk/vla/vla_contacts.htm">Find your nearest regional laboratory for diagnostic tests on the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Veterinary Laboratories Agency">VLA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="animal-feed-testing">Animal feed testing</h3>

<p>After the discovery of a link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to cattle, legislation was introduced to ban the feeding of some processed animal proteins to animals.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> provides three tests that can detect the following animal proteins which may be present in animal feed:</p>

<ul>
<li>blood meal</li>
  <li>blood products</li>
  <li>bone meal</li>
  <li>dried greaves</li>
  <li>dried plasma</li>
  <li>feather meal</li>
  <li>fish meal</li>
  <li>hoof meal</li>
  <li>horn meal</li>
  <li>hydrolysed proteins</li>
  <li>meat meal</li>
  <li>poultry offal</li>
</ul>
<p>The three tests are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microscopic Analyst Test - a microscopic analysis examination of ground feed samples for the presence of muscle fibres, cartilage, horn, hair, animal or fish bone fragments, blood, feathers or fish scales.</li>
  <li>Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction - this highly-sensitive test uses fluorescent dyes and relies on the thermal stability of DNA from bovine, porcine, ovine and/or avian origins to detect banned animal materials in feed.</li>

<h2 id="reporting-notifiable-diseases">Reporting notifiable diseases</h2>

<p>Notifiable diseases must be reported to <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>, the government agency responsible for controlling them.</p>

<p>If you suspect your stock may have a notifiable disease, you should contact your vet immediately and impose movement restrictions on your farm. <a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/openpopup?itemId=1082226190&amp;r.l1=1081597476&amp;r.l2=1082184851&amp;r.l3=1083732142&amp;r.l4=1097202076&amp;type=ONEOFFPAGE">See our table of Animal Health Office (<abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>) contact details in England</a>.</p>

<p>Notifiable diseases can be either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>endemic - these are continually present in Great Britain, eg tuberculosis in cattle, and scrapie in sheep</li>
  <li>exotic - these are not normally found in Great Britain, eg avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, swine fever and rabies</li>
</ul>
<p>Some notifiable diseases, known as zoonoses, affect humans too.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-and-control-disease-with-biosecurity">How to prevent and control disease with biosecurity</h2>

<p>Biosecurity measures can help prevent the spread of farmed diseases - including notifiable diseases - across the UK. They also protect agricultural workers and visitors. Different biosecurity procedures apply to animals on farms and to animals being moved, for example to markets and agricultural shows.</p>

<p>Disease control through biosecurity focuses on controlling and reducing movements of animals, people and vehicles to and from areas where livestock is kept. Rules are set by <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> - an agency of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> - which is responsible for ensuring that farm animals are healthy, disease-free and well looked after.</p>

<h3 id="on-farm-biosecurity-measures">On-farm biosecurity measures</h3>

<p>The key to good biosecurity is reducing and controlling the movements of people, vehicles or equipment into areas where your farm animals are kept. Some diseases are more prevalent than others. For example, if you keep livestock, you will particularly be on the alert for foot and mouth disease whereas poultry keepers need to be vigilant against avian influenza (bird flu).</p>

<p>You should check the health status of livestock before buying or selling animals. Strict rules control identifying and moving livestock - even if you only keep one animal. New animals should be kept separate from existing stock on first arrival.</p>

<h3 id="disinfectant-procedures-for-animal-diseases">Disinfectant procedures for animal diseases</h3>

<p>Disinfection is one of the main biosecurity measures to control the spread of animal diseases. Equipment, vehicles, protective clothing and footwear must all be cleaned and disinfected before and after contact with farm animals. Where practicable, you should use disposable protective clothing.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://disinfectants.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Location=None&amp;module=ApprovalsList_SI">Find a list of approved disinfectants on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Disinfectants should be applied under low pressure, for example from a backpack sprayer. Disinfectants can also be used as biosecurity barriers for vehicles and people at farm entrances. Before disinfecting structures such as sheds, you should clean them with detergents to remove organic matter and oily films.</p>

<p>Special procedures apply when disinfecting vehicles used to transport farm animals. <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/biosecurity/cleansing.htm">Find out about cleaning and disinfection of livestock vehicles on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>During a disease outbreak, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will usually impose restrictions on animal movements, and suspend agricultural markets and shows.</p>

<h3 id="biosecurity-at-agricultural-markets-and-shows">Biosecurity at agricultural markets and shows</h3>

<p>Under the Animal Gatherings Order 2010, a general licence is required for any livestock gathering - eg markets and shows - alongside the industry’s commitment to best practice. You can <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/publications/advice-guidance/documents/AH-AnimalGathering-DL.pdf">download brief guidance on biosecurity at animal gatherings from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 788K)</a>.</p>

<p>The golden rule is ‘clean in, clean off’:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t bring onto or take off the market any vehicle, equipment or clothing contaminated with animal excreta - other than the inside of vehicles or protective clothing taken off the site for disposal or laundering</li>
  <li>don’t leave the animal area without cleaning any contamination from your clothes</li>
  <li>don’t leave the animal area without cleansing and disinfecting your boots</li>
</ul>
<p>Biosecurity measures at markets and shows are legally enforceable.

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-and-control-disease-with-farm-health-planning">How to prevent and control disease with farm health planning</h2>

<p>Farm health planning (<abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr>) is one of the most effective ways of tackling animal disease and improving your livestock’s performance. The main benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>improved farm profits</li>
  <li>improved sustainability</li>
  <li>better stock health and welfare</li>
  <li>a farmer/vet relationship focused on improving performance</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> is based on four key principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>measure - use your records to identify how much disease costs your farm each year</li>
  <li>manage - with your vet or other adviser, prioritise control measures for problem health areas, using cost/benefit calculations and the most effective health management methods</li>
  <li>monitor - regularly review the progress of your <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr> and change it as necessary</li>
  <li>seek advice - prevention is better than cure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cattle-fhp">Cattle <abbr title="Farm health planning">FHP</abbr>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-and-control-disease-in-specific-livestock-species">How to prevent and control disease in specific livestock species</h2>

<p>Specific legal controls and biosecurity measures apply to many common breeds of farm animals and birds.</p>

<h3 id="cattle">Cattle</h3>

<p>Cattle biosecurity measures follow general principles of controlling stock movement, and disinfecting vehicles and clothes belonging to people travelling between sites.</p>

<p>Related measures to control foot and mouth disease include covering disinfectant footbaths between uses so they are not diluted by rain. You should also prevent cattle from coming into contact with animals that cannot develop the disease, but can transmit infected material - for example, dogs, cats, poultry and foxes.</p>

<p>You can limit bovine tuberculosis transmission by deterring badgers from entering properties - for example with yard dogs, water jets or pigs - and ensuring that feed containers are sealed to prevent contamination.</p>

<p>Other control measures include the control of fallen stock - animals that die on your farm because of accident or disease. These control measures are of particular relevance to the control of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Carcasses are classed as animal by-products and must be disposed of under the rules of the National Fallen Stock Scheme or by an approved private contractor.</p>

<h3 id="pigs">Pigs</h3>

<p>Pig biosecurity procedures must be of a high standard to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as swine influenza. Pig farmers should:</p>

<ul>
<li>prohibit unnecessary visitors to the farm</li>
  <li>cleanse and disinfect any shared equipment before it enters and after it leaves your premises</li>
  <li>make sure that personnel in contact with pigs at different premises take standard precautions, such as cleaning and disinfecting boots and clothing</li>
  <li>prevent people with flu-like symptoms coming into contact with pigs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sheep-and-goats">Sheep and goats</h3>

<p>Sheep and goat biosecurity control follows the general principles of controlling movements of people and livestock, as well as disinfecting vehicles, equipment, clothing and footwear. Diseases of sheep and goats may not always be apparent in the early stages, so stock keepers should regularly monitor their animals for signs of illness.</p>

<p>As with cattle, fallen sheep and goats should be treated as animal by-products and disposed of using standard fallen stock procedures.</p>

<h3 id="poultry">Poultry</h3>

<p>Poultry farmers can increase the biosecurity of flocks through standard control measures, such as washing hands after handling birds and disinfecting boots when travelling between farms. Poultry-specific measures include:</p>

<ul>
<li>using disposable protective clothing where practicable</li>
  <li>providing clean drinking water and food - preferably indoors to prevent contamination by wild animals</li>
  <li>isolating new birds</li>
  <li>having a plan for bringing a flock indoors if necessary</li>
  <li>cleaning and disinfecting housing at the end of each cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial poultry farmers should also follow salmonella control principles as part of the National Control Programme (NCP) for the disease which applies to:</p>

<ul>
<li>laying flocks of more than 350 hens on a single premises</li>
  <li>eggs for hatching and farmyard poultry chicks</li>
  <li>eggs in shell for human consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>This involves providing <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> with the registration details of your business and the number of birds and flocks you have. You must also comply with sampling procedures, eg boot and sock swabs.</p>

<p>Poultry farmers should be alert for signs of notifiable avian diseases, eg avian influenza (bird flu) and Newcastle disease, and should report signs immediately to their vet and local Animal Health Office (<abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<h3 id="deer">Deer</h3>

<p>Biosecurity measures specific to deer - whether farmed, park or wild - include health monitoring for notifiable diseases such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>foot and mouth disease</li>
  <li>bovine tuberculosis</li>
  <li>bluetongue</li>
  <li>epizootic haemorrhagic virus disease</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to limit or prevent contact of deer with neighbouring livestock, and to be aware of the health status of any animals bought or sold.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-prevent-and-control-farm-diseases-that-can-infect-humans">How to prevent and control farm diseases that can infect humans</h2>

<p>Diseases that can spread from animals to humans, known as zoonoses, require careful control. About 40 zoonoses currently exist in the UK - most are mild and tend to clear up naturally.</p>

<p>But some zoonoses cause serious health problems or can be fatal. These diseases are notifiable, which means you must report them to your local Animal Health Office (<abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>). <a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/openpopup?itemId=1082226190&amp;r.l1=1081597476&amp;r.l2=1082184851&amp;r.l3=1083732142&amp;r.l4=1097202076&amp;type=ONEOFFPAGE">See our table of <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> contact details in England</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, notifiable zoonoses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>anthrax</li>
  <li>avian influenza</li>
  <li>bovine spongiform encephalopathy</li>
  <li>brucellosis</li>
  <li>equine viral encephalomyelitis</li>
  <li>glanders and farcy</li>
  <li>rabies</li>
  <li>rift valley fever</li>
  <li>tuberculosis</li>
  <li>West Nile virus</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-notifiable zoonoses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>coxiella - causing Q fever</li>
  <li>chlamydia - causing pscittacosis/ovine chlamydiosis</li>
  <li>toxoplasma - causing toxoplasmosis</li>
  <li>orf - skin disease of sheep</li>
  <li>ringworm</li>
</ul>
<p>If your farm and/or food processing business is open to the public, it is particularly important for you to have preventative measures in place at all times. Preventative health measures on farms include hand-washing facilities - these are especially important for visitors and open farms.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/ais23.pdf">Download information about preventing ill health at open farms from the <abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website (PDF, 83K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="using-coshh-rules">Using <abbr title="Control of substances hazardous to health">COSHH</abbr> rules</h3>

<p>Where zoonoses are known or likely to be present on the farm, you also need to carry out a Control of substances hazardous to health (<abbr title="Control of substances hazardous to health">COSHH</abbr>) risk assessment. Employers and self-employed people must ensure they are doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>assessing risks to health from work activities which involve a hazardous substance - eg a microorganism</li>
  <li>preventing or controlling exposure to the hazardous substances</li>
  <li>introducing and maintaining control measures</li>
  <li>informing, instructing and training employees about risks and precautions</li>
  <li>regularly reviewing risk assessments and the effectiveness of control measures</li>
</ul>
<p>When making risk assessments, you must involve farm employees and especially safety representatives. You should also ask employees - or potential employees - if they have any health conditions, such as suppressed immunity, which may make them vulnerable to zoonoses.</p>

<h2 id="disposing-of-fallen-stock-and-restocking-cattle-herds-and-sheep-flocks">Disposing of fallen stock and restocking cattle herds and sheep flocks</h2>

<p>The disposal of fallen stock and <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> not intended for human consumption is regulated with a risk-based approach. ‘Fallen stock’ can be any animal that has:</p>

<ul>
<li>died of natural causes or disease on the farm</li>
  <li>been killed on the farm for reasons other than human consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>The National Fallen Stock Company (<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>) is a non-profit organisation that runs the voluntary National Fallen Stock Scheme for the collection and disposal of fallen stock.  </p>

<p>Read the related guide for detailed information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/dealing-with-animal-by-products">dealing with animal by-products</a>.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-fallen-stock">Disposing of fallen stock</h3>

<p>You must not bury or burn fallen stock in the open, other than in exceptional circumstances - eg the outbreak of a notifiable disease - as this risks spreading disease through groundwater or air pollution.</p>

<p>When you find fallen stock, you should arrange for it to go to an approved:</p>

<ul>
<li>knacker</li>
  <li>hunt kennel</li>
  <li>incinerator</li>
  <li>renderer</li>
  <li>maggot farm</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do this either by private arrangement or under the National Fallen Stock Scheme. For more information, you can contact the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> Helpline on Telephone: 0845 054 8888.</p>

<p>To find an approved knacker, hunt kennel, incinerator, maggot farm or renderer, you should contact your <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>. You must immediately contact your <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> if you think an animal has died of a notifiable disease.</p>

<h3 id="fallen-cattle-aged-over-48-months">Fallen cattle aged over 48 months</h3>

<p>Currently, fallen cattle over 48 months of age must be tested for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (<abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>), which is a form of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (<abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathy">TSE</abbr>). Fallen cattle over 24 months that were born outside Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK must also be tested for <abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must contact a collector within 24 hours of your animal’s death, to arrange delivery to an approved sampling site within 72 hours. If you are delivering the carcass yourself, you must contact an approved sampling site to agree this within 24 hours and must deliver the carcass within 72 hours of the animal’s death.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/managing-disease/animalbyproducts/premises.htm">find approved premises for <abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathy">TSE</abbr> testing of fallen cattle on the Animal Health website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="restocking-cattle-herds">Restocking cattle herds</h3>

<p>If you are buying or selling a cattle herd, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>develop a herd health plan with a vet</li>
  <li>assess (if buying) or provide (if selling) written evidence of outbreaks among the herd</li>
  <li>check the herd’s tuberculosis testing records</li>
  <li>establish that importers have complied with the relevant regulations</li>

<li>comply with livestock movement regulations</li>
  <li>develop a flock health plan with your vet</li>
  <li>provide (if selling) or assess (if buying) written evidence of any diseases within the flock</li>
  <li>consider the possibility of scrapie, with reference to the National Scrapie Plan</li>
  <li>comply with all import regulations</li>

<h2 id="restrictions-and-controls-following-an-animal-disease-disease-outbreak">Restrictions and controls following an animal disease disease outbreak</h2>

<p>If a notifiable disease is confirmed amongst your animals, there are likely to be automatic restrictions placed upon your premises as part of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) contingency plan for disease outbreaks.</p>

<h3 id="premises-restrictions">Premises restrictions</h3>

<p>When a notifiable disease is confirmed on a site, notices will be posted at all entrances to the premises and people leaving and arriving at the farm will be controlled - except certain people under licence. Rights of way through the premises may also be closed temporarily. An approved disinfectant must be used to disinfect footwear, clothing and vehicles before entering or leaving the premises. For most exotic notifiable diseases, all susceptible animals on the premises are humanely culled.</p>

<h3 id="area-restrictions">Area restrictions</h3>

<p>When a notifiable disease is confirmed, a protection zone will be set up around the infected premises - and in most cases this will have a minimum radius of three kilometres. A surveillance zone will also be established, with a minimum radius of ten kilometres.</p>

<p>Controlled area restrictions are normally applied to restrict movement of animals outside the protection and surveillance zones. This occurs when there is - or is likely to be - a risk of spreading the disease more widely, eg if an infected animal is found to have passed through a market.</p>

<p>In the case of foot and mouth disease, rights of way may be closed in the protection zone. This is to control the risk of people using rights of way from coming into contact with the virus and carrying infection to other premises.</p>

<h3 id="restrictions-and-controls-during-an-outbreak-of-an-exotic-notifiable-animal-disease">Restrictions and controls during an outbreak of an exotic notifiable animal disease</h3>

<p>If area restrictions have been imposed on your premises, you should make only essential visits to any other livestock premises. For most exotic notifiable diseases, all susceptible animals on the premises are humanely culled. Non-essential visits to premises with farm animals should be suspended.</p>

<p>You must make plans to ensure the welfare of your stock, and you should consider the likely implications of movement controls during an outbreak when preparing contingency plans for your business - eg making provision for keeping animals past their intended slaughter weight.</p>
