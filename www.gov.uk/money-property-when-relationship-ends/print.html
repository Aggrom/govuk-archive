  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can avoid the cost of going to court and large legal fees by working out an agreement with your partner.</p>

<p>Use the <a rel="external" href="http://divorce.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/thinking-about-separation-or-divorce/divorce-separation-tool.html" title="divorce and separation calculator">divorce and separation calculator</a> to work out your finances and what you own.</p>

<p>Once you’ve reached an agreement, you can get the court to make it legally-binding, by applying for a ‘consent order’.</p>

<h2>If you can’t agree</h2>

<p>If you can’t agree, you can ask the court to decide using a ‘financial order’.</p>

<p>If you want to do this, you first have to go to a ‘mediation information and assessment meeting’ with a family mediator.</p>

<p>This is to find out if you can reach an agreement with your partner without going to court.</p>

<p>Contact a <a rel="external" href="http://www.familymediationhelpline.co.uk/find-service.php/" title="family mediation service">family mediation service</a> to arrange to go to a meeting.</p>

</article><article id="apply-for-consent-order"><header><h1>Part 2: Apply for a consent order</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to make an agreement legally binding, you need to get a solicitor to draft a ‘consent order’.</p>

<p>This is a legal document that confirms your agreement, and can include details on how you are going to divide up your assets, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>money</li>
  <li>property</li>
  <li>savings</li>
  <li>investments</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also include arrangements for maintenance payments, including child maintenance.</p>

<p>You and your ex-partner both have to sign the draft consent order.</p>

<p>Both of you also need to fill in:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2655" title="notice of an application for a financial order">notice of an application for a financial order</a>
</li>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1116" title="statement of information form">statement of information form</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Send these forms to the court with the draft consent order attached. Keep your own copies.</p>

<p>A consent order costs £45. </p>

<p>You may be able to get help with <a href="/court-fees-what-they-are/" title="court fees">court fees</a> if you’re on benefits or a low income.</p>
</div>

<p>A judge will approve the agreement to make it legally binding if they think it’s fair and reasonable.</p>

</article><article id="apply-for-a-financial-order"><header><h1>Part 3: Apply for a financial order</h1>
  </header><p>If you can’t reach an agreement, you can ask a court to decide by applying for a financial order. This used to be called an ‘ancillary relief order’.</p>

<p>You can apply for a financial order if you want, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>a lump sum payment </li>
  <li>ownership of a property</li>
  <li>regular maintenance payments to help with children or living expenses </li>
  <li>a share of your partner’s pension payments</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying for a financial order costs £240.</p>

<p>The process is separate from the divorce, and usually takes longer - often 6 to 12 months.</p>

<p>You may have to attend a court appointment and go to a number of court hearings.</p>

<p>To apply for a financial order, fill in a <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2655" title="financial order application form">financial order application form.</a></p>

<p>Send 2 copies of the form to the court dealing with your case. Keep your own copies.</p>

</article><article id="how-the-court-splits-assets"><header><h1>Part 4: How the court splits assets</h1>
  </header><p>The judge will decide on the division of assets based on how long you’ve been married or in a civil partnership, as well as your:</p>

<ul>
<li>ages</li>
  <li>ability to earn</li>
  <li>property and money</li>
  <li>living expenses</li>
  <li>standard of living</li>
  <li>role in the marriage or civil partnership (eg if you were the breadwinner or primary carer)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are enough assets to meet everyone’s needs, the judge will decide on the fairest way to divide the assets.</p>

<p>If there isn’t enough, the judge will make arrangements for any children first - especially their housing arrangements and child maintenance.</p>

<p>The judge will usually try to arrange a ‘clean break’, so everything is shared out, and you no longer have any financial ties to one another.</p>

</article><article id="maintenance-payments"><header><h1>Part 5: Maintenance payments</h1>
  </header><p>The court sometimes tells the person with the higher income to make regular maintenance payments to help with the other person’s living costs.</p>

<p>This is called a ‘maintenance order’.</p>

<p>A maintenance payment can be set for:</p>

<ul>
<li>a limited period of time</li>
  <li>until one of you dies, marries or enters into a new civil partnership</li>
</ul>
<p>The payment can also be changed if one of you loses your job or gets much better paid work.</p>

<p>The court can also decide on child maintenance, but this is often arranged by the Child Support Agency.</p>
