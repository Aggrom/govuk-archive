  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>It’s against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control:</p>

<ul>
<li>in a public place</li>
  <li>in a private place where the dog isn’t allowed to be (eg a neighbour’s house or garden without permission)</li>
</ul>
<p>The law applies to <strong>all</strong> dogs.</p>

<p>Some <a href="/control-dog-public/banned-dogs" title="Banned dogs">types of dogs are banned</a>.</p>

<h2>Out of control</h2>
<p>Your dog is considered dangerously out of control if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>injures someone</li>
  <li>makes someone worried that it might injure them</li>
</ul>
<p>A court could also decide that your dog is dangerously out of control if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it injures someone’s animal</li>
  <li>the owner of the animal thinks they could be injured if they tried to stop your dog attacking their animal</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>A farmer is allowed to kill your dog if it’s worrying their livestock.</p>
</div>

<h2>Penalties</h2>
<p>You can be fined up to £5,000 and/or sent to prison for up to 6 months if your dog is out of control. You may also not be allowed to own a dog in the future.</p>

<p>If you let your dog injure someone, you can be sent to prison for up to 2 years and/or fined.</p>

<p>If you deliberately use your dog to injure someone you could be charged with ‘malicious wounding’. The maximum penalty is 5 years in prison.</p>

</article><article id="banned-dogs"><header><h1>Part 2: Banned dogs</h1>
  </header><p>In the UK, it’s against the law to own certain types of dog. These are the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pit Bull Terrier</li>
  <li>Japanese Tosa</li>
  <li>Dogo Argentino</li>
  <li>Fila Braziliero</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also against the law to:</p>

<ul>
<li>sell</li>
  <li>abandon</li>
  <li>give away </li>
  <li>breed from</li>
</ul>
<p>a banned dog. </p>

<p>Whether your dog is a banned type depends on what it looks like, rather than its breed or name.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> If your dog matches many of the characteristics of a Pit Bull Terrier, it may be a banned type.</p>
</div>

<h2>You have a banned dog</h2>
<p>If you have a banned dog, the police or local council dog warden can take it away and keep it, even if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it isn’t acting dangerously</li>
  <li>there hasn’t been a complaint</li>
</ul>
<p>The police may need permission from a court to do this. If your dog is in:</p>

<ul>
<li>a public place, the police <strong>don’t</strong> need a warrant </li>
  <li>a private place, the police <strong>must</strong> get a warrant </li>
  <li>a private place and the police have a warrant for something else (like a drugs search), they can seize your dog</li>
</ul>
<p>A police or council dog expert will judge what type of dog you have and whether it is (or could be) a danger to the public. Your dog will then either be:</p>

<ul>
<li>released </li>
  <li>kept in kennels while the police (or council) apply to a court</li>
</ul>
<p>While you wait for the court decision, you’re not allowed to visit your dog.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can give up ownership of your dog but you can’t be forced to. If you do, your dog could be destroyed without you even going to court.</p>
</div>

<h2>Going to court</h2>
<p>It’s your responsibility to prove your dog is not a banned type.</p>

<p>If you prove this, the court will order the dog to be returned to you. If you can’t prove it (or you plead guilty), you’ll be convicted of a crime. </p>

<p>The maximum penalty for having a banned dog against the law is a £5,000 fine and/or 6 months in prison. Your dog will also be destroyed.</p>

<h3>Index of Exempted Dogs (<abbr title="Index of Exempted Dogs">IED</abbr>)</h3>
<p>If your dog is banned but the court thinks it’s not a danger to the public, it may put it on the <abbr title="Index of Exempted Dogs">IED</abbr> and let you keep it. </p>

<p>You’ll be given a Certificate of Exemption. This is valid for the life of the dog.</p>

<p>You dog must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>neutered</li>
  <li>tattooed</li>
  <li>microchipped</li>
  <li>kept on a lead and muzzled at all times when in public </li>
  <li>kept in a secure place so it can’t escape</li>
</ul>
<p>As the owner, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>take out insurance against your dog injuring other people</li>
  <li>be aged over 16 </li>
  <li>show the Certificate of Exemption when asked by a police officer or council dog warden, either at the time or within 5 days</li>
  <li>let the <abbr title="Index of Exempted Dogs">IED</abbr> know if you change address, or your dog dies</li>
</ul>

</article><article id="dog-control-orders"><header><h1>Part 3: Dog Control Orders</h1>
  </header><p>Local councils in England and Wales can issue Dog Control Orders (<abbr title="Dog Control Orders">DCOs</abbr>). </p>

<p>These mean that in public areas with <abbr title="Dog Control Orders">DCOs</abbr>, you may have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep your dog on a lead</li>
  <li>put your dog on a lead if told to by a police officer, police community support officer or someone from the council</li>
  <li>stop your dog going in certain places - like farmland or parts of a park</li>
  <li>limit the number of dogs you have with you (this applies to professional dog walkers too)</li>
  <li>clear up after your dog</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><abbr title="Dog Control Orders">DCOs</abbr> <strong>don’t</strong> apply to private land if you have permission from the land owner or person who controls the land.</p>
</div>

<h2>Penalties</h2>
<p>If you ignore a <abbr title="Dog Control Order">DCO</abbr>, you can be fined:</p>

<ul>
<li>£50 on the spot (a ‘Fixed Penalty Notice’)</li>
  <li>up to £1,000 if it goes to court</li>
</ul>
<p>You <strong>can’t</strong> be fined if you’re a registered blind dog owner.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Dog Control Orders">DCOs</abbr> in your area</h2>
<p>Local councils must let the public know where <abbr title="Dog Control Orders">DCOs</abbr> are in place. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> If dogs aren’t allowed in a park, there must be signs saying so.</p>
</div>

<p>If the council plans to put a new <abbr title="Dog Control Order">DCO</abbr> in place, it must put up a notice and publish it in a local newspaper and on its website. </p>

<p>The notice must tell you:</p>

<ul>
<li>where the new <abbr title="Dog Control Order">DCO</abbr> will apply </li>
  <li>if there’s a map and where you can see it </li>
  <li>where you can write or email to have your say - you should have at least 28 days </li>
</ul>
<p>After 28 days, your local council will decide whether to go ahead with the <abbr title="Dog Control Order">DCO</abbr> or change it. If there are lots of changes, the council will publish another notice, with the same timescales.</p>


</article><article id="dog-fouling"><header><h1>Part 4: Dog fouling</h1>
  </header><p>Your council has a legal duty to keep public areas clear of dog mess. </p>

<p>If you don’t clean up after your dog you can be given an on-the-spot fine. The amount varies from council to council. It’s often £50 and can be as much as £80.</p>

<p>If you refuse to pay the fine, you can be taken to court and fined up to £1,000. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Registered blind dog owners can’t be fined.</p>
</div>

<p>Some <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">councils</a> have stricter rules on dog fouling. They may make owners carry a poop scoop and disposable bag when they take their dogs out to a public place. </p>

<p>You can <a href="/report-dog-fouling" title="Report dog fouling to your council">report dog fouling to your local council.</a></p>

</article><article id="report-a-dog"><header><h1>Part 5: Report a dog</h1>
  </header><p>Anyone can report a dog and their owner to the police.</p>

<p>You can report a dangerous dog to <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">your council’s</a> dog warden service.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="/report-dog-fouling" title="Report dog fouling to your council" rel="external">report dog fouling</a> to your local council.</p>
