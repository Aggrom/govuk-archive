  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>An Authorised Testing Facility (<abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>) tests that heavy goods vehicles, trailers and public service vehicles like buses are roadworthy and meet safety and environmental standards. </p>

<p>To set up an <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>, you must apply to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>). They’ll carry out an assessment and probably also do a site inspection before deciding whether you can open.</p>

<p>You can’t test vehicles until you’re authorised - but as an <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>have <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> staff test your own vehicles</li>
  <li>offer a testing service to third parties using <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> staff - customers can test their vehicles at your <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr> instead of at a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> test station</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>An <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr> can’t test cars, motorbikes, small vans etc - to test these type of vehicles, you must apply to <a href="/become-an-mot-station" title="Set up an MOT station">set up an MOT testing station</a>.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="how-to-apply"><header><h1>Part 2: How to apply</h1>
  </header><p>To set up as an Authorised Testing Facility (<abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>), you’ll need:  </p>

<ul>
<li>a testing area that’s at least 2 metres wider than the vehicles to be tested</li>
  <li>a permanent weatherproof building</li>
  <li>testing equipment</li>
  <li>offices that Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) staff can visit and work from</li>
</ul>
<p>For full details, read the <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr> checklist before you apply. There’s also a guide on how to operate an <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr> - this covers health and safety, equipment and the fees you can charge.</p>

</article><article id="what-happens-to-your-application"><header><h1>Part 3: What happens to your application</h1>
  </header><p>You should get a response by post within 2 weeks of sending in your application. </p>

<p>If your application is ‘provisionally accepted’, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) will contact you to discuss site development. </p>

</article><article id="site-inspection-and-approval"><header><h1>Part 4: Site inspection and approval</h1>
  </header><p>The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) will normally carry out an initial site inspection and a final site inspection before you can be approved as an Authorised Testing Facility (<abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Site inspections</h2>

<p>Once <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has visited your site, you’ll get a report - usually within a week.   </p>

<p>If your site passes the initial inspection, there may be a final inspection before you get approved - let <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> know when you’re ready and they’ll arrange a visit.</p>

<p>If it fails the inspection, you’ll be told what needs to be done and given a deadline to send in new plans.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your site fails its final inspection, <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will send you a letter telling you what you need to do.</p>
</div>

<h2>Approval</h2>

<p>When <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has given final approval, you’ll get your certificate and can operate as an <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>. You’ll have to operate under the terms set out in the <abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr> contract.</p>
