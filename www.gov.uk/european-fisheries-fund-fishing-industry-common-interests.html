<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you want to invest in measures of common interest for the fisheries industry, you may be eligible for a grant from the European Fisheries Fund (<abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>).</p>

<p>‘Measures of common interest’ are collective projects that achieve a common aim. They can include collective actions such as upgrading professional skills, protecting and developing aquatic fauna and flora, investing in existing fishing ports, developing new markets and promotion campaigns, and pilot operations - such as testing innovative technology.</p>

<p>The amount of funding you could receive will depend on the type of project, the area, and whether you are applying as a public or private body. You may need to match <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> funding with private funds or funding from other public sources.</p>

<p>This guide explains the different types of projects covered by <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> common interests funding, the conditions of getting a grant and how to apply.</p>

<h2 id="who-may-apply-for-a-common-interests-grant">Who may apply for a common interests grant?</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> grants are available to any enterprise in the public and private sector that work on a collective project to achieve a common aim. These could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>collective actions, eg creating a producer organisation or upgrading professional skills</li>
  <li>investments in existing fishing ports</li>
  <li>protecting and developing aquatic fauna and flora</li>
  <li>developing new markets and promotion campaigns</li>
  <li>pilot projects, eg to test innovative technology, develop methods to improve gear selectivity or test alternative fishing management techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> aims to provide support for measures of common interest, which are implemented with the active support of the operators themselves, or by organisations acting on behalf of producers or other organisations. These may be public or private bodies such as non-government organisations, scientific or trade organisations.</p>

<p>Pilot projects will only be eligible where they are non-commercial and are carried out by approved bodies such as economic operators and recognised trade associations, or any other UK-designated competent body, in partnership with a scientific or technical body.</p>

<p>Grants for applications for projects to protect and develop aquatic flora and fauna are available to public or semi-public bodies, recognised trade organisations or other bodies appointed for that purpose by the UK.</p>

<h3 id="when-can-you-apply-for-a-grant">When can you apply for a grant?</h3>

<p>You may apply for an <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> grant at any time. Depending on the amount of your grant, and how complicated it is, your application form and business case might have to go forward to a selection panel. These are normally held three times a year. The Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) publishes details of when the panel meets on their website.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> reserves the right to close the programme earlier if the funds allocated to the programme have been used up. You should also note that the eligibility criteria may be reviewed from time to time during the life of the programme.</p>

<p>For advice, contact the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="eligibility-for-collective-actions-grants">Eligibility for collective actions grants</h2>

<p>The main objectives of <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> collective actions grants are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure a well qualified and innovative industry through the development and delivery of skills training</li>
  <li>support common actions that will contribute to improved management, sustainable use of resources, improved hygiene standards and minimisation of environmental impacts</li>
  <li>provide conditions in which the fisheries industry can be profitable in the long-term and competitive in both global and local markets</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to be eligible, your project must show how it covers the measures of common interest with a broader scope than normally undertaken by private enterprises. Support will be granted to projects of common interest which:</p>

<ul>
<li>contribute sustainably to better management or conservation of resources</li>
  <li>promote selective fishing methods or gear and reduction of by-catch</li>
  <li>improve working conditions and safety</li>
  <li>contribute to the transparency of markets in fisheries and aquaculture products including traceability</li>
  <li>improve quality and food safety</li>
  <li>contribute to the improved production, processing or marketing equipment and infrastructure</li>
  <li>upgrade professional skills or develop new training methods and tools</li>
  <li>promote partnership between scientists and operators in the fisheries sector</li>
  <li>contribute to UK objectives for small-scale coastal fishing</li>
  <li>create or restructure producer organisations</li>
</ul>
<p>Those projects which are most likely to attract grant funding would be those which help to improve the balance between the fishing effort and opportunity, and those which would increase profitability and competitiveness or increase employment.</p>

<p>The minimum grant you can apply for is £600, and the maximum grant you can receive is £500,000. This must be matched equally with money from national sources and the appropriate amount of private investment. Funds will be awarded to projects demonstrating the best value for money.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility-for-fishing-ports-investment-grants">Eligibility for fishing ports investment grants</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> may support investments in existing public or private fishing ports, with the aim of improving the services offered to fishers and aquaculture producers. These must be of a broader scope than operations undertaken by private enterprises.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> may also support investments to restructure landing sites and to improve the conditions for fish landed by coastal fishers in existing landing sites. This can include projects which are concerned with the:</p>

<ul>
<li>conditions under which fisheries and aquaculture products are landed, processed, stored in the port and auctioned</li>
  <li>provision of fuel, ice, water and electricity</li>
  <li>working or safety conditions</li>
  <li>storage and treatment of waste and reduce discards</li>
  <li>construction, modernisation and extension of quays improving safety during landing or loading</li>
  <li>repair, equipment and maintenance of fishing vessels</li>
  <li>computerised management of fishing activities</li>
</ul>
<p>The construction of fishing ports is not eligible for support under the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>.</p>

<p>In most cases, the costs of planning permission, design and consultancy, quotations and equipment may be incurred before you receive authority to start work. However, feasibility studies are not eligible for grant aid.</p>

<p>Projects which might be eligible for fishing ports investment grants include:</p>

<ul>
<li>improvements to fish markets</li>
  <li>electronic selling systems</li>
  <li>sorting, grading and weighing systems</li>
  <li>upgrades to market or fish handling/storage areas</li>
  <li>equipment to improve the traceability of fish</li>
  <li>projects which improve food chain co-operation</li>
  <li>improvements to environmental protection and pollution controls</li>
  <li>improvement of safety during landing and loading of products</li>
  <li>ice production, storage and delivery</li>
  <li>hygienic storage and disposal of trade wastes</li>
  <li>box washing and storage</li>
  <li>mechanised floor washing/scrubbing machines</li>
  <li>winches, fuel provision and vessel maintenance and repair</li>
  <li>security cameras on markets/quays</li>
  <li>gear storage</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the grant would not generally cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>normal operating costs</li>
  <li>office equipment and furniture</li>
  <li>equipment purchased during the previous seven years with the aid of European Union or national grants</li>
  <li>second-hand equipment, where the price of the equipment exceeds its market value and is more than the cost of similar new equipment</li>
  <li>vehicles for external transportation - such as delivery vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum grant from the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> for fishing port investment funding is £200, up to a maximum of £2,000,000. However, this is limited to £1,000,000 for private applicants. This must also be match-funded by other national funding or private finance.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility-for-aquatic-flora-and-fauna-grants">Eligibility for aquatic flora and fauna grants</h2>

<p>The main objectives of <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> aquatic fauna and flora grants are to support the protection and development of aquatic fauna and flora, while enhancing the aquatic environment. These measures relate to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the construction or installation of static or movable facilities intended to protect and develop aquatic fauna and flora</li>
  <li>the rehabilitation of inland waters, including spawning grounds and migration routes for migratory species</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are applying for an aquatic flora and fauna grant, you will need to show that your project covers ‘measures of common interest’ with a broader scope than normally undertaken by private enterprises. For more information, see the page in this guide on who may apply for a common interest grant.</p>

<h2 id="eligibility-for-pilot-projects-grants">Eligibility for pilot projects grants</h2>

<p>Pilot projects supported by the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> must meet certain conditions to qualify. For example, they must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be truly innovative - small technical improvements of well-known technologies are not sufficient to qualify for <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> support. Pilot projects should also have limited cost and duration, in line with their experimental nature.</li>
  <li>not be of a directly commercial nature. Any profit generated from a pilot project will be deducted from the public aid granted to the operation.</li>
  <li>be carried out in conditions approaching actual industry conditions, to establish their technical reliability and/or financial viability.</li>
  <li>use appropriate scientific monitoring methods to produce significant results.</li>
  <li>be consistent with Common Fisheries Policy rules and principles.</li>
  <li>cover measures of common interest with a broader scope than measures normally undertaken by private enterprises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the total costs of a pilot project exceed €1 million, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will, prior to its approval, require an assessment by an independent scientific body.</p>

<p>At the end of the project you must forward a scientific report to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/forms/eff/pilot_eligibility.pdf">Download a list of items which are and are not eligible for pilot project grant support from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 66KB).</a></p>

<p>The minimum grant is £1,000, up to a maximum of £500,000. Your grant must be supplemented by money from other national sources or private investment. The proportion of the project costs paid for will depend on the nature of the project, whether the applicant is a public or a private body, and where the project is located.</p>

<h2 id="being-awarded-a-grant-for-measures-of-common-interest">Being awarded a grant for measures of common interest</h2>

<p>If you are applying for a grant from the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> for your project, you should be aware that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you cannot receive a grant on your project from more than one European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) fund. You must confirm on the application form that you have not applied for an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> grant on your project under another scheme.</li>
  <li>your project must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK legislation.</li>
  <li>your project must have a funding package which includes match funding from UK, public money and private funds.</li>
  <li>your project should not duplicate existing or planned activity or expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-offer-letter">The offer letter</h3>

<p>The offer letter will set out details of the conditions attached to the offer of grant and the agreed performance targets and outputs for the project. You must comply with these targets and conditions to enable the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> to pay your claim(s) for grant.</p>

<p>When you receive your offer letter you should check it carefully, sign one copy and return it before you can commence your project. You should do this within four weeks. After this period the offer will expire.</p>

<p>Details of applications will be treated as commercially confidential throughout the assessment stage. Once your project has been approved the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will make some details public, in particular the name of the successful applicant, the amount of grant approved and the nature of the project. In accepting an offer you will be considered to have given your consent to this. You should acknowledge that you have obtained an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> grant on any publicity for the project.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-change-a-project-after-i-have-accepted-an-offer-of-grant">Can I change a project after I have accepted an offer of grant?</h3>

<p>You can apply for modifications to your project once you have signed the offer letter. However, you must secure approval in writing before going ahead with any change to your project. If you do not do this, any resulting costs could become ineligible for grant aid.</p>

<p>You should note that if you make any changes to an approved project without the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>’s prior approval, they may revise or cancel the grant award.</p>
