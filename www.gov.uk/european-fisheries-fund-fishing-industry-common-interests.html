<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you want to invest in measures of common interest for the fisheries industry, you may be eligible for a grant from the European Fisheries Fund (<abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>).</p>

<p>‘Measures of common interest’ are projects that benefit groups and achieve a common aim. They include  large regeneration projects, upgrading professional skills, smaller harbour developments, promotional activity, protecting marine wildlife and developing the marine envrionment and pilot projects (such as testing innovative technology).</p>

<p>The amount of funding you could receive will depend on the type of project, the area, and whether you are applying as a public or private body. You may need to match <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> funding with private funds or funding from other public sources.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-apply">Who can apply?</h2>

<p>You, as the applicant, must sign the application form, even if you had help completing it as you will be responsible for making sure that all of the terms and conditions of the grant are met.</p>

<p>There are 5 different funding streams within common interests and each has its own criteria on who can apply.</p>

<h3 id="collective-actions">Collective actions</h3>

<h3 id="pilot-projects-1">Pilot projects</h3>

<p>Pilot projects must be truly innovative and small, technical improvements of well known technologies do not qualify. The projects should have limited cost and duration in line with their experimental nature and should not be of a directly commercial nature.</p>
