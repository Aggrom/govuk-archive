  <li>you’re only receiving the dangerous goods (you’re the ‘consignee’)</li>
  <li>they’re in ‘<a href="/shipping-dangerous-goods/transport-limited-quantities" title="limited quantities">limited quantities’</a>
</li>
  <li>you’re moving them a very short distance by road eg between buildings on an industrial estate</li>
  <li>you’re using private vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>A DGSA must receive training on an approved training course. Further guidance on training is available from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/freight/dangerous-goods/training" title="dangerous goods training">Department for Transport website.</a></p>
