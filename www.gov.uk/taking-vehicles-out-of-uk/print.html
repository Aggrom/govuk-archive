  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="for-12-months-or-more"><header><h1>Part 1: For 12 months or more</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re taking a UK-registered vehicle out of the country for 12 months or more (also known as permanent export) you need to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> by filling in the V5C/4 ‘notification of permanent export’ section of your V5C registration certificate (logbook).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send it to <strong><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, Swansea, SA99 1BD</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the rest of your V5C registration certificate - you might need this to register your vehicle abroad.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>If you don’t have a V5C registration certificate</h2>
<p>You’ll need to get one using form V62. The address to send it to is on the form.</p>

</div>

<h2>Moving your vehicle between Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>You don’t need a V561 certificate of permanent export if you’re moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Fill in the change of address section on your V5C registration certificate and send to a <a rel="external" href="http://www.dvlni.gov.uk/lvlolocation.htm" title="DVA (Driver and Vehicle Agency) local office"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Agency">DVA</abbr> (Driver and Vehicle Agency) local office.</a></p>

<h3>Moving from Northern Ireland and Great Britain</h3>

<p>Fill in the change of address section on your V5CNI registration certificate and send to a <a href="/dvla-offices" title="DVLA local office"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> local office</a>.</p>

<h3>Tax discs</h3>

<p>Leave the current tax disc on the vehicle until it expires and then re-tax in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, depending on where you’ve moved to.</p>

<h2>Personalised registrations</h2>

<p>You’ll need to <a href="/transferring-vehicle-registration-number-form-v317" title="transfer or retain your personalised registration">transfer or retain your personalised registration</a> before exporting your vehicle. Otherwise you’ll lose your right to the registration number.</p>


</article><article id="for-less-than-12-months"><header><h1>Part 2: For less than 12 months</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re taking your vehicle abroad for less than 12 months (also known as temporary export) you don’t need any special documentation.</p>

<p>But a UK-registered vehicle exported temporarily remains subject to UK law. That means that you need to make sure it is taxed in the UK while it’s abroad.</p>

<p>To do this it’ll need a current MOT certificate and insurance.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to make sure you meet any international or national conditions for licensing and taxation.</p>

<h2>Bringing your vehicle back untaxed</h2>

<p>If you bring your vehicle back to the UK untaxed you can’t drive it back into the UK - it’ll have to be transported and a <a href="/register-sorn-statutory-off-road-notification" title="SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification)">SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification)</a> must be made straight away.</p>

<h2>Taking hired vehicles abroad temporarily</h2>

<p>You’ll need a VE103 vehicle on hire certificate to show you’re allowed to use a hire vehicle if you’re driving it abroad.</p>

<p>You can get a VE103 for a fee from the:</p>

  </header><p>If you buy a brand new vehicle to take out of the UK (also known as supply of a ‘New Means of Transport’) you don’t have to pay UK <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> or vehicle taxes such as the registration fee.</p>

<h2>Within the EU</h2>

<p>If you’re buying the new vehicle to take elsewhere in the EU you won’t have to pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>take it out of the UK within 2 months</li>
  <li>don’t drive the vehicle in the UK unless you register and tax it</li>
</ul>
<p>Your supplier will get you to fill out form <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> 411. </p>

<h2>Exports outside the EU</h2>

<p>You may be able to use the Personal Export Scheme to export a <strong>new or used</strong> vehicle outside the EU. </p>

<p>This means that when you buy a new vehicle and export under the scheme, you don’t pay UK <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. But you still have to pay vehicle taxes and the registration fee.</p>

<p>You can use the scheme if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>from outside the EU  </li>
  <li>an EU resident who’s leaving the EU for at least 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>You usually have to be personally driving your vehicle to a non-EU country.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>read <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_031661&amp;propertyType=document" title="How VAT applies if you import or export a personal vehicle"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 707</a>
</li>
  <li>fill out form <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> 410 (your supplier will give you a copy) and give it to your supplier
You can drive the vehicle in the UK for up to 6 months after the delivery date (or 12 months for non-EU residents) - it must then be exported.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll get a special tax disc and, if it’s a new vehicle, a pink VX302 registration book. </p>

<p>The date for export of the vehicle is shown on the VX302 (for new cars) or the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> 410 (for used cars).</p>

<p>After export send the DVLA:</p>

<ul>
<li>VX302 - new vehicles  </li>
  <li>V5C - second-hand vehicles</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>For both schemes - if you don’t export the vehicle on time you’ll have to pay the UK <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>
