<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The financial penalties system for fisheries offences has existed since 28 April 2008. The scheme applies to you if you are the owner, skipper, or charterer of an English or Welsh fishing vessel (or their representative). It also applies to foreign fishing vessels operating within the English and Welsh part of British fishery limits.</p>

<p>If you commit an offence you will not be convicted if you pay the penalty. You do not have to pay the penalty and can choose to have the matter dealt with in court instead.</p>

<p>This guide explains the circumstances in which administrative penalties apply, the investigation process and how the level of the offence is assessed. It outlines the four levels of penalty payable, and explains how they can be paid.</p>

<h2 id="detection-and-investigation-of-fisheries-offences">Detection and investigation of fisheries offences</h2>

<p>You will have to pay administrative penalties for infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy and offences against the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.</p>

<p>Marine enforcement officers (<abbr title="Marine enforcement officers">MEOs</abbr>), including sea fisheries committee officers, both at sea and ashore, carry out enforcement duties and issue penalty notices. All penalties are authorised by the Deputy Chief Marine Officer (Operations) at the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) headquarters.</p>

<h3 id="minor-offences">Minor offences</h3>

<p>These are handled with discretion at a local level. You will be given verbal or written advice or a written warning.</p>

<p>You will only be issued with a written warning where there is evidence to the criminal standard. Only one written warning will be given to any person, partnership or company for the same category of offence in a two-year period. This includes written warnings issued in the two years before the scheme was implemented. A written warning may not always be issued for a first offence.</p>

<h3 id="serious-offences">Serious offences</h3>

<p>For serious offences (and if you have already received a written warning for the same category of offence), the MMO will decide whether a penalty notice should be issued. A decision is made within six weeks of finalising the investigation.</p>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p>The investigation process can take up to six months. During this time, your fishing licence will be frozen in accordance with the fisheries departments’ published policy (this applies to UK vessels only).</p>

<p>If you are then given a penalty, the licence will remain frozen until the penalty is paid, or, if you choose not to pay the penalty, until court proceedings are concluded.</p>

<p>If it is decided that no further action will be taken, the licence freeze will be lifted.</p>

<h2 id="offences-which-can-lead-to-an-administrative-penalty">Offences which can lead to an administrative penalty</h2>

<p>If you are the owner, skipper and/or charterer of a fishing vessel which operates within an English or Welsh part of the British fishery limits, you must be aware of activities which are considered an offence and the administrative penalties they may incur.</p>

<p>The MMO has categorised offences and rated them according to their level of seriousness and extent to which they have breached their category.</p>

<p>Categories range from 1-7 with penalty levels set between 1-4. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Category 1 - marketing standards offences have a penalty level of 1</li>
  <li>Category 2 - miscellaneous offences have a penalty level of 2</li>
  <li>Cateogry 3 - technical conservation gear offences have a penalty level of 3</li>
  <li>Category 4 - technical conservation catch offences have a penalty level of 3</li>
  <li>Category 5 - recovery and special permit stock offences have a penalty level of 3</li>
  <li>Category 6 - control order offences, i.e. logbook, licence and satellite have a penalty level of 3</li>
  <li>Category 7 - access offences have a penalty level of 4</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following circumstances, however, penalties may be adjusted:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the financial gain from the offence is bigger than the proposed level of penalty, the penalty will be increased beyond the amount of the gain. For example, if the penalty is set at £4,000 but the financial gain is greater than £4,000, the offence will be referred to court.</li>
  <li>if the person subjected to the penalty has received a penalty for the same category of offence in the two previous years.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out more about specific offences within each category, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/monitoring/documents/fap_guidance.pdf">download guidance on administrative penalties for fisheries offences from the MMO website (PDF, 139KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="consideration-of-administrative-penalties">Consideration of administrative penalties</h2>

<p>If a fisheries offence is of a criminal standard, the following criteria are considered by the MMO when deciding whether to issue an administrative penalty:</p>

<ul>
<li>Level of infringement - whether it is a serious or minor offence</li>
  <li>Previous offences committed which have resulted in a warning letter, the payment of a penalty or a conviction</li>
  <li>Other offences discovered at the same time as the offence in question and the nature of these offences - these may add to the seriousness of the overall breach</li>
  <li>Value of catch, which may affect the decision if the potential financial gain is greater than the proposed penalty</li>
  <li>Volume of catch - where this is not large enough to warrant a direct referral for prosecution. This is particularly relevant to by-catch offences but may factor in other offences</li>
  <li>Stock recovery measures - whether the species involved is subject to these measures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="offences-that-will-lead-to-prosecution">Offences that will lead to prosecution</h3>

<p>The following offences will not incur an administrative penalty but will be referred for prosecution:</p>

<ul>
<li>obstruction offences, including not complying with requirements made by a <abbr title="Marine enforcement officer">MEO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>threats or assaults to <abbr title="Marine enforcement officers">MEOs</abbr> or their assistants</li>
  <li>offences under an EU recovery plan, which attract automatic licence suspension</li>
</ul>
<p>If more than one offence is found in a single investigation, the offences will be broken down, categorised and given individual penalties. In these cases the MMO may decide not to give a penalty notice but will refer the matter to court for prosecution.</p>

<h2 id="penalty-notices-for-fisheries-offences">Penalty notices for fisheries offences</h2>

<p>Once a fisheries offence administrative penalty is issued, a notice containing details of the offence and the level of the penalty being offered will be issued to you and any others liable for the offence. Notices will be hand-delivered or sent by post and will state how payments should be made.</p>

<h3 id="withdrawal-of-a-penalty-notice">Withdrawal of a penalty notice</h3>

<p>A penalty notice can be withdrawn before or after the payment of the penalty, if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>is issued by mistake</li>
  <li>contains technical errors</li>
  <li>is issued to the wrong person</li>
</ul>
<p>Where a penalty notice is withdrawn, any monies paid will be repaid in full.</p>

<h2 id="penalty-levels-for-fisheries-offences">Penalty levels for fisheries offences</h2>

<p>There are four basic levels of administrative penalty, depending on the type of fisheries offence committed.</p>

<h3 id="level-1---marketing-offences">Level 1 - Marketing offences</h3>

<ul>
<li>The penalty for a first offence will be £250.</li>
  <li>The penalty for a second offence will be £500.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="level-2---miscellaneous-offences">Level 2 - Miscellaneous offences</h3>

<ul>
<li>The penalty for a first offence will be £500.</li>
  <li>The penalty for a second offence will be £1,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="level-3---technical-conservation-gear-offences-technical-conservation-catch-offences-recovery-and-special-permit-stock-offences-and-control-order-offences">Level 3 - Technical conservation gear offences, technical conservation catch offences, recovery and special permit stock offences and control order offences</h3>

<ul>
<li>The penalty for a first offence will be £1,000.</li>
  <li>The penalty for a second offence will be £2,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="level-4---access-offences">Level 4 - Access offences</h3>

<ul>
<li>The penalty for a first offence will be £2,000.</li>
  <li>The penalty for a second offence will be £4,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, after a second offence, all cases are referred for prosecution.</p>

<p>The administrative penalty will be increased to the next level if the offence relates to a stock which requires special measures - ie a recovery or management plan (not including cod). It will also be increased to the next level if the person has received a penalty for the same category of offence in the previous two years.</p>

<p>If the offender has profited from their offence - and their financial gain is greater than the proposed penalty -  the penalty will be increased to the next level beyond the financial gain up to a maximum of £4,000. If the financial gain is greater than £4,000, the offence will be referred to court.</p>

<h2 id="paying-penalties-for-fisheries-offences">Paying penalties for fisheries offences</h2>

<p>Administrative penalties must be paid by owners, masters, charterers of a fishing vessel, or their representative. The MMO will accept one person paying on behalf of others who are liable.</p>

<p>For example, if the master and the owner have both been issued with a £1,000 penalty notice for an offence for which they are jointly and severally liable, they do not have to pay £1,000 each. Instead, either one can pay the whole amount on behalf of both of them.</p>

<p>Once a payment has been received, all parties involved in the joint offence will receive written confirmation that the penalty has been paid.</p>

<p>If you choose not to pay a penalty and are found not guilty in court, all records of the case will be removed from the central register and will not count as a previous offence in any future decisions.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-pay-a-penalty">How to pay a penalty</h3>

<p>You have 28 days to pay a penalty before the case is referred for prosecution.</p>

<p>You must pay by cheque or electronic transfer. Payment in cash is not permitted. If you have any queries you should contact the MMO Finance Helpline on 0191 376 2625.</p>
