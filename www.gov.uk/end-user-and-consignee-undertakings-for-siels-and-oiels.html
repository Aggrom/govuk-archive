<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When applying for an export licence from the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>), one of the most important elements is to ensure that you have attached an accurate and correct undertaking form (completed by the end-user company) along with all your submitted export details.</p>

<p>One of the most common errors in applications received by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> is an incorrect or missing undertaking which can cause frustrating delays with your application.</p>

<p>Correct completion of the undertakings needs to be taken seriously by your company. It is also vital that you have a good understanding of how they affect your business operations and licence application.</p>

<p>The purpose of a completed undertaking for export control purposes is to guard against the risk of UK exports being diverted or re-exported to ‘undesirable’ end-users. This diversionary risk is among those identified in the Consolidated <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, which sets out the factors to be considered in all case-by-case assessments for applications of strategic (military or dual-use) items.</p>

<p>The Government believes the best way of minimising the risk of diversion is a thorough risk assessment at the licensing stage. This process includes careful examination by  <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> of information about the proposed end-use and end-user of the proposed export.</p>

<p>As an export licence applicant, you have an important part to play in ensuring that your end-user completes the relevant undertaking as required by <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> and that you take care in attaching the relevant undertaking to any licence application.  </p>

<p>This guide advises you on the relevant undertakings that <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> publish. It also offers guidance to exporters and end-users or consignees on completing the relevant template form.</p>

<h2 id="undertakings-required-for-siel-and-sitcl-applications">Undertakings required for <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> and SITCL applications</h2>

<h3 id="when-is-this-undertaking-required">When is this undertaking required?</h3>

<p>An undertaking is required when applying for a Standard Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>) or Standard Individual Trade Control Licence issued by the UK’s Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>).</p>

<p>It is part of the supporting documentation for End-Use Control purposes which needs to be provided when submitting an export licence application via SPIRE to the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. Read guidance about End-Use Controls.</p>

<h3 id="what-undertakings-are-availalbe">What undertakings are availalbe?</h3>

<p>There are two types of undertaking forms available. Which one you - the exporter - opt to obtain in support of an application depends on how the intended exports will be used.</p>

<p>If goods are being exported (whether via a consignee or not): </p>

<ul>
<li>for their end-use or if an end-user is incorporating the goods (ie installing them into another product or higher level system) - then you should obtain an End User Undertaking (<abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>) Form. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/forms/end-user-undertaking-form-july-2012.doc">Download an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> form and covering letter template from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) website (DOC, 68KB).</a>
</li>
  <li>to be held in stock for future delivery or re-sale - then you should obtain a Stockist Undertaking (SU) Form. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/forms/stockist-undertaking-form-july-2012.doc">Download an SU form and covering letter template from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (DOC, 72.5KB).</a>  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-should-complete-the-relevant-form">Who should complete the relevant form?</h3>

<p>The end-user or stockist end-user should be advised to complete the relevant version of these forms together with a covering letter (on original official headed paper of the overseas company).</p>

<p>It is the exporter’s responsibility to ensure that all sections of the correct undertaking and covering letter are completed legibly, in English and signed by an appropriate responsible official. They should also attach a copy of the undertaking to attach to the licence application on SPIRE and retain the original in their records.</p>

<p><abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> reserves the right to require an exporter to produce the original document, if necessary. They would expect to make such requests on rare occasions only.</p>

<p>However, if you are specifically asked to provide the original undertaking during the course of the export licence application process, then you should be aware that <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will not issue a licence if you fail to provide the original document.</p>

<h3 id="further-guidance-and-advice-in-completing-the-forms">Further guidance and advice in completing the forms</h3>

<p>To help you in completing the relevant undertaking, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/forms/end-user-checklist-july-2012.doc">download an undertaking checklist document from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (DOC, 87KB).</a> and also <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/12-749-end-user-scenarios.pdf">download guidance on export scenarios from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (DOC, 137KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-template-undertaking-form-is-not-used-by-the-end-user">What is a template undertaking form is not used by the end-user?</h3>

<p>If the end-user or stockist end-user chooses not to use the template forms issued by <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, you should advise them that the UK Authorities require an original (not ‘digital’) signed and dated undertaking in English on their headed paper (where the end-user is a company or a legal entity).</p>

<p>This document needs to provide the same information and assurances as specified in the relevant forms published by <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<p>If an undertaking form is completed by an individual (as opposed to a company) this does not need to be on headed paper.</p>

<p>See also guidance on situations where you are unable to obtain an undertaking from the overseas company (questions eight and nine) in frequently asked questions on undertakings.</p>

<h3 id="excecptions-occasions-when-an-undertaking-is-not-required">Excecptions (occasions when an Undertaking is not required)</h3>

<p>In general an application for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> licence for temporary export will not need an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>. Every other <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> application needs to be accompanied by some documentation from the end-User country. In almost all cases this will be a relevant undertaking template. However, in certain circumstances, the following alternatives may be accepted:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the foreign buyer is a government body, then any or all of the following may be accepted in lieu of an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> - either a purchase order, a copy of relevant pages from the contract or an International Import Certificate. </li>
  <li>when applying for an export licence for small arms export, then a Prior Import Consent (PIC) is required from the appropriate European Union member state (in lieu of an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="undertakings-required-for-oiel-applications">Undertakings required for <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> applications</h2>

<p>All Open Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>) applications require a Consignee Undertaking in accordance with licence conditions.</p>

<p>This document must be obtained in advance from the end user and submitted along with other supporting documentation via the SPIRE export licensing system.</p>

<p>The Undertaking should confirm the nature of the goods ordered by the consignee and what they will be used for. Consignees are also asked to confirm that the goods won’t be used for purposes associated with Weapons of Mass Destruction.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> Consignee Undertaking should be completed by the organisation or company to whom the goods are being sent, confirming that the end use of the items match the <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> conditions.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/forms/oiel-euu-template.doc">Download an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> Undertaking template from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) website (DOC, 21KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="undertakings-required-for-open-general-licences">Undertakings required for Open General Licences</h2>

<p>Open General Licences (OGLs) involve a registration process via <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s SPIRE export licensing database.</p>

<p>As a result, in most circumstances, there is no upfront requirement to obtain an undertaking.</p>

<p>OGL holders are required however to adhere to all the specified terms and conditions. This includes keeping certain records as required by the licence for the controlled goods and technology being exported. For more information see the guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology">compliance and enforcement of export controls</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/open-general-licences-an-overview">Open General Licences:an overview.</a></p>

<p>If you hold the Open General Export Licence (Military Goods) there is a specific condition to demonstrate ‘permitted use’. For this purpose, <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> have issued a template undertaking for this particular licence. For more information see the page about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/military-goods-ogels">Military Goods Open General Export Licences.</a></p>

<h2 id="end-user-certificate-required-for-chemicals-listed-in-schedule-3-chemical-weapons-convention">End User Certificate required for chemicals listed in Schedule 3 (Chemical Weapons Convention)</h2>

<h3 id="when-is-this-certificate-required">When is this certificate required?</h3>

<p>An End User Certificate (<abbr title="End-User Certificate">EUC</abbr>) is required when applying for a Standard Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>) to export chemicals listed in Schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention (<abbr title="Chemical Weapons Convention">CWC</abbr>) to any country that has not ratified the convention (states not party). </p>

<p>The <abbr title="End-User Certificate">EUC</abbr> form is part of the supporting documentation for End-Use Control purposes which needs to be provided when submitting an export licence application for such items via SPIRE to the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. Read guidance on End-Use Controls.</p>

<p>A list of countries that have ratified the <abbr title="Chemical Weapons Convention">CWC</abbr> is available from the UK <abbr title="Chemical Weapons Convention">CWC</abbr> National Authority (NCLU) on Tel 0300 068 5939.

<p>If they choose not to use this published template, you should advise them that the UK authorities require an original signed and dated undertaking in English on their headed paper (where the end-user is a company or a legal entity) which provides the same information and assurances as specified in the relevant version. This document should also include an ‘original’ signature (not a ‘digital’ signature) and should be stamped by a government department or ministry within the recipient country.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-role-of-the-uk-exporter">What is the role of the UK exporter?</h3>

<p>It is the exporter’s responsibility to ensure that the all sections of the correct certificate and covering letter are completed legibly, in English and signed by an appropriate responsible official. They should also attach a copy of the undertaking to attach to the licence application and retain the original in their records.</p>

<h2 id="re-export-declaration-clause-on-euu-and-su-templates">Re-export declaration clause on <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> and SU templates</h2>

<p>In accordance with the UK Government’s commitment to uphold arms embargoes, the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>) requires that end-users and stockist end-users declare on the relevant undertaking template that they will not re-export or otherwise transfer goods where to do so would be in breach of an embargo.</p>

<p>There is also a requirement when completing the Stockist Undertaking (SU) template to adhere to the Weapons of Mass Destruction(WMD) clause. This specific clause is included to guard against exports, which are held in stock, being diverted to undesirable end users in the future.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-mean-by-embargo-and-where-can-i-find-a-list-of-applicable-embargoes">1. What do you mean by ‘embargo’ and where can I find a list of applicable embargoes?</h3>

<p>By ‘embargo’ we mean a restriction on trade with the target country in arms and military equipment and other specified items imposed by either the United Nations (UN), European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) or Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (<abbr title="Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe">OSCE</abbr>). </p>

<p>The UK is legally obliged or has made a political commitment to uphold and enforce these embargoes. An up-to-date list of embargoes can be found in the guide on current arms embargoes and other restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="if-i-am-exporting-dual-use-goods-does-my-undertaking-have-to-contain-the-no-re-export-clause">2. If I am exporting dual-use goods does my undertaking have to contain the ‘no re-export’ clause?</h3>

<p>Yes. While most embargoes are arms embargoes, there are some which include dual-use goods, such as the Iran sanctions. Some embargoes also include dual-use goods which might be used for internal repression. It is also not possible to predict what emabargoes will be imposed in the future and what they might cover.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-the-goods-are-to-be-re-exported-to-an-embargoed-destination-in-support-of-a-peace-keeping-or-humanitarian-mission">3. What if the goods are to be re-exported to an embargoed destination in support of a peace-keeping or humanitarian mission?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> asks for a declaration that the goods will not be re-exported where to do so would be a breach of an embargo. Embargoes often contain exemptions that permit exports of military equipment in certain circumstances, such as in support of peace-keeping operations or international missions or for use by humanitarian or media organisations and in some cases for supply to legitimate government end-users. If the re-export is for a purpose permitted under the embargo in question, and is made within the terms of the embargo, then clearly this is not a breach and so the declaration is still valid. If you are in any doubt as to whether the re-export would contravene an embargo, you should seek advice from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-end-user-have-to-ask-the-uk-governments-permission-if-they-want-to-re-export-the-goods-to-an-embargoed-destination">4. Does the end-user have to ask the UK Government’s permission if they want to re-export the goods to an embargoed destination?</h3>

<p>No. This is not a re-export control where end-users must seek the UK Government’s permission if they wish to re-export the goods. The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> is asking that end-users make a declaration that they will respect the terms of those embargoes to which the UK is legally or politically bound by not re-exporting UK supplied goods where to do so would be in breach of the embargo.</p>

<h3 id="if-the-goods-are-subsequently-re-exported-in-breach-of-an-arms-embargo-will-i-be-held-responsible">5. If the goods are subsequently re-exported in breach of an arms embargo, will I be held responsible?</h3>

<p>You will not be held responsible for the actions of your customers. If however you had any involvement in the breach you may be liable to prosecution or other appropriate remedial action. The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> may also take into account regarding re-exports to embargoed destinations in any subsequent licensing assessments.</p>

<h3 id="does-re-export-include-situations-where-the-goods-are-incorporated-in-some-other-item-and-that-other-item-is-subsequently-exported">6. Does ‘re-export’ include situations where the goods are incorporated in some other item and that other item is subsequently exported?</h3>

<p>No. In this context ‘re-export’ refers to the subsequent export from the initial destination country of the goods that you exported, in the form that you exported them. Where goods are to be incorporated into another item (eg as components) and that other item is subsequently exported, or the goods are to be subject to further processing in the end-user country before subsequent export, then that is not considered to be a ‘re-export’. However, in these cases you must provide the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> with details (so far as they are known) of the final recipient of the goods. This information should be provided in the ‘third party’ section of the licence application.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-undertakings">Frequently asked questions about Undertakings</h2>

<p>The following are questions that users may have about using an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-an-euu-and-why-is-it-required">1. What is an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> and why is it required?</h3>

<p>This is a document completed by the end user or stockist end-user which details who they are, where they are based and for what purpose they are using the goods. There are different forms which are relevant for either Standard Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>), Standard Individual Trade Control Licence (SITCL) or Open Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>) applications.</p>

<p>When applying for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>, the exporter needs to attach either an End-User Undertaking (<abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>) or Stockist End-User Undertaking (SU) form to the application submitted via SPIRE, <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s export licensing database.</p>

<p>When applying for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> to export chemicals listed under Schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention then an End-User Certificate (<abbr title="End-User Certificate">EUC</abbr>) is required.</p>

<p>When applying for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, a Consignee Undertaking is required.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-complete-and-sign-an-undertaking">2. Who should complete and sign an undertaking?</h3>

<p>The undertaking should be completed and signed by a person properly authorised by the end-user or stockist end-user to sing on their behalf (the responsible official).</p>

<p>In the case of an <abbr title="End-User Certificate">EUC</abbr> used for chemical exports, then the undertaking needs to be stamped by a recognised foreign government department or ministry within the recipient country.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-end-user-have-to-complete-the-euu-form-in-english">3. Does the end user have to complete the <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> form in English?</h3>

<p>Each undertaking (eg <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>, SU, <abbr title="End-User Certificate">EUC</abbr>), official purchase order, or copy of the relevant part of the contract covering the order, must be written in English. Alternatively, if written in a foreign language, the document must be accompanied by an English translation. Every English translation must be verified by the proprietor of the business applying for a licence, or a partner, director or company secretary of the firm, or anyone authorised to sign the licence application. Alternatively, if you prefer, translations may be verified by a member of the Institute of Translators or a Notary Public.</p>

<h3 id="how-should-the-end-user-authenticate-the-undertaking-form">4. How should the end user authenticate the undertaking form?</h3>

<p>It is the exporter’s responsibility to obtain an original form from their end user or stockist end-user as appropriate. Each page of that form must contain an original signature and be dated. With each completed form, the end user or stockist end-user must provide a covering letter on their headed stationery. The letter must be signed and dated by the same signatory who has completed and signed the form.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-the-end-user-complete-the-undertaking-form">5. When should the end user complete the undertaking form?</h3>

<p>You (the UK exporter) should send a copy of the completed form with your licence application on SPIRE. If you obtain the undertaking before you are ready to submit your application, we will normally accept undertakings as valide within six months of the date of the application.</p>

<h3 id="we-supply-to-original-equipment-manufacturers-oems-who-incorporate-our-products-into-their-own-which-they-then-sell-to-their-own-customers-who-is-the-end-user-in-this-case">6. We supply to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who incorporate our products into their own which they then sell to their own customers. Who is the end user in this case?</h3>

<p>The end-user is the entity that uses or processes goods in some way. If you supply to OEMs then they should complete the <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> form.</p>

<p>You are advised to <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/12-749-end-user-scenarios.pdf">download the export scenarios from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (DOC, 137KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="we-sell-to-a-distributor-at-time-of-export-we-have-no-way-of-knowing-who-they-will-sell-to-or-what-the-goods-will-be-used-for-who-is-the-end-user-in-this-case">7. We sell to a distributor. At time of export we have no way of knowing who they will sell to or what the goods will be used for. Who is the end user in this case?</h3>

<p>The Stockist Undertaking (SU) is completed by the distributor (as stockist). If the ultimate end user is known at the time of export, then the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>) needs to know and an End User Undertaking (<abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>) should be completed.</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-we-are-unable-to-obtain-an-undertaking-from-our-end-user-what-should-we-do">8. Sometimes we are unable to obtain an undertaking from our end user. What should we do?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> asks exporters to provide as much detail as possible, and they also encourage exporters to set up appropriate contracts with suppliers - as they are your goods, how do you protect your business from sales you wouldn’t want to be involved in? If the agent sites commercial reasons for not providing an undertaking, they would accept them directly from the agent.</p>

<p>You need to perform due diligence. If an end user is unable to provide an undertaking then this might be a reason to be suspicious about the transaction.</p>

<h3 id="can-the-eco-accept-any-other-documents-instead-of-an-undertaking">9. Can the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> accept any other documents instead of an undertaking?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> would advise you to complete the relevant template form, but in some cases they will accept other documents - for instance if you are completing a government purchase or contract. If you provide documents other than an undertaking then you need to include the same information as requested on the template undertaking form.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-are-consignee-undertakings-for-oiels-valid-for">10. How long are consignee undertakings (for OIELs) valid for?</h3>

<p>Undertakings are valid for one year. Note that they must be obtained in advance.</p>
