<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is for farmers and land managers who use planned, controlled burning of heather, rough grass, gorse, bracken and Vaccinium shrub species. It also includes information on burning reedbeds and sedge beds.</p>

<p>It outlines good practice in planning and carrying out responsible, safe burning that aims to improve rough grassland, create different-aged heather patches for grouse, help wildlife conservation - by establishing niche habitats for rare species - and restore commercial reed and sedge beds.</p>

<p>The guide explains the laws and regulations on heather and grass burning, and specifies how cross compliance requirements apply.</p>

<h2 id="heather-and-grass-burning-and-cross-compliance">Heather and grass burning and cross compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and other direct payments - eg the Environmental Stewardship schemes - you must meet all relevant cross compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAECs)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> and GAECs, see the guides on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">cross compliance: the basics</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-management-requirements">SMR</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/standards-of-good-agricultural-and-environmental-condition">standards of <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> dealing with the burning of heather and grass is <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 10. Its provisions are in line with the Heather and Grass etc Burning (England) Regulations 2007. If you comply with the 2007 Regulations, you will also be complying with <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 10.</p>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 10 specifies that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must not burn heather, rough grass, bracken, gorse or Vaccinium outside the burning season except under, and in accordance with, a licence to do so, issued by Natural England</li>
  <li>you may only burn between sunrise and sunset in the ‘burning season’, which runs from 1 October to 15 April in Severely Disadvantaged Less Favoured Areas, and from 1 November to 31 March in other areas</li>
  <li>you must burn safely, with enough people and equipment to control and regulate the burning during the entire period of the work</li>
  <li>before and throughout the burn, you must take all reasonable precautions to prevent injury or damage to any neighbouring land or to any people or things on it</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.crosscompliance.org.uk/">find information on cross compliance requirements on the Cross Compliance website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="heather-and-grass-burning-law-and-licences">Heather and grass burning law and licences</h2>

<p>The Heather and Grass etc Burning (England) Regulations 2007 explain what you can and cannot do when carrying out controlled burning of permitted vegetation. The Heather and Grass Burning Code 2007, which was developed by Natural England and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) in consultation with industry partners, outlines good practice for burning heather and grass on your farm.</p>

<p>The 2007 Regulations apply to the burning of heather, rough grass, gorse, bracken and Vaccinium (shrub species such as bilberries). They specify that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you may only burn between sunrise and sunset in the ‘burning season’, which runs from 1 October - 15 April (inclusive) in land which is within an upland area (Severely Disadvantaged Less Favoured Areas (<abbr title="Less Favoured Areas">LFAs</abbr>) and from 1 Nov - 31 March in other areas. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.magic.gov.uk/website/magic/viewer.htm?startTopic=magicall&amp;chosenLayers=lfaIndex">see a map of <abbr title="Less Favoured Areas">LFAs</abbr> on the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside website</a>
</li>
  <li>you must burn safely, with enough people and equipment to control and regulate the burning during the entire period of the work</li>
  <li>before and throughout the burn, you must take all reasonable precautions to prevent injury or damage to any neighbouring land or to any people or things on it</li>
</ul>
<p>Natural England is responsible for enforcing the 2007 Regulations. They will investigate all reported breaches, and may:</p>

<ul>
<li>issue a ‘burning notice’, which requires the occupier of the land to notify Natural England of any proposed burning of permitted vegetation on their land for up to two years from the date the notice is served</li>
  <li>send a warning letter</li>
  <li>prosecute through the courts</li>
  <li>seek an injunction</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need a licence from Natural England if you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>burn outside the burning season</li>
  <li>burn more than ten hectares in a single burn</li>
  <li>burn, in a burning season, more than 0.5 hectares on a slope steeper than 45 degrees, or on rocky or scree areas</li>
  <li>burn, in a burning season, in a way that exposes more than 0.5 hectares of bare soil</li>
  <li>burn, in a burning season, in a way that exposes bare soil that stretches for more than 25 metres along the banks of a watercourse and is more than a metre wide at all points</li>
  <li>leave soil smouldering for more than 48 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply for a licence, you can <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=250035&amp;id=252788">download a Natural England application form for burning under the heather and grass burning regulations from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (DOC, 49K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance">Cross compliance</h3>

<p>In order to meet cross compliance requirements if you burn vegetation on land that you manage, you must meet <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> standards.  You can find out more in the guides on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">cross compliance: the basics</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/standards-of-good-agricultural-and-environmental-condition">standards of <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-laws-that-apply-to-burning">Other laws that apply to burning</h3>

<p>The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) prohibits any activity which disturbs or destroys wild birds and their nests, or other protected animals and plants.</p>

<p>The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 makes it an offence to damage ‘scheduled monuments’.</p>

<p>Other safety and environmental legislation also applies, eg where burning endangers the public, is likely to cause injury, interruption or danger to road users, or creates smoke which may damage health or is a nuisance.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-burning-plan">Writing a burning plan</h2>

<p>Before burning, it is a good idea to write a burning plan that identifies where and when to burn. This will help you to burn safely and legally.</p>

<p>If you agree your burning plan with Natural England, eg as part of a management agreement, the plan will take precedence over the Heather and Grass Burning Code if the two disagree.</p>

<p>Your burning plan should include a detailed Ordnance Survey map where you have outlined and colour-coded the following areas of your land:</p>

<ul>
<li>sensitive areas where you will not burn</li>
  <li>areas requiring particular care - anywhere in a Site of Special Scientific Interest, lowland, coastal and maritime heathland, and areas with bracken or archaeological remains</li>
  <li>the area to be burnt, including colour-coded areas needing different rotations so that you can calculate the area you need to burn each year</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also include a key to the map which lists the types of colour-coded areas and rotations identified on your map - for example:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Area Types</p>
</div>

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Area description</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Map colour code</strong></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Peat bog</td>
      <td>red</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Steep slopes</td>
      <td>blue</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Bracken</td>
      <td>yellow</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Rotation Cycle</p>
</div>

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rotation description (years)</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Average area to be burnt (hectares)</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Map colour code</strong></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>green</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>25</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
      <td>purple</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You should also plan a safe size of area to burn:</p>

<ul>
<li>on heather moorland, try to keep burns to a maximum width of 30 metres - never allow the width to exceed 55 metres</li>
  <li>for gorse and broom scrub, and heathland that you manage for grazing or grouse, keep individual burns to an area of less than two hectares - don’t burn more than one third of the gorse or broom scrub in any one year</li>
  <li>for grassland, grass moorland, reedbeds and fens, keep burns to less than five hectares and within individual stretches of these habitats - don’t burn more than one third in any one year</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, your burning plan should indicate when you plan to burn - this must fall within the burning season.</p>

<p>In case the burn goes wrong, you should make an emergency plan which covers how to deal with injuries, other unforeseen events, how to summon back-up help quickly, and a contact list of neighbours and emergency services.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-sensitive-areas">Identifying sensitive areas</h2>

<p>To prepare your burning plan, you will need to identify sensitive areas where you will not burn, except under exceptional circumstances - when you will need to apply for a Natural England licence. </p>

<p>The following types of area are unsuitable for burning:</p>

<ul>
<li>woodland, woodland edges and small trees/scrub - fire spreading into these areas is likely to be very damaging</li>
  <li>juniper scrub - this is a fire-sensitive species and plants will not recover after burning</li>
  <li>peat bog and wet heathland - these should not need excessive management, if any at all, and often contain a high level of structural diversity, which is very important for biodiversity. The risk of peat exposure and damage is also high, leading to drying of peat, the release of carbon, and increased erosion and surface runoff</li>
  <li>areas of soil erosion - burning exposed soil, or vegetation extending into it, can make soil erosion worse. Burning into peat may ignite the peat, creating a high risk of a wildfire</li>
  <li>areas of thin soil - these are often rich in slow-growing and fire-sensitive ferns, vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. The risk of soil exposure and erosion is also very high</li>
  <li>steep hillside - fires take longer to spread on steep slopes, resulting in a hot and slow fire that damages the moss layer and impedes regeneration. They are also difficult to control, and can widen as they progress uphill</li>
  <li>gullies - these can act like a chimney, drawing air upwards and greatly increasing the intensity and rate of spread of a fire</li>
  <li>mountain habitats - these occur above the natural tree-line, which is usually around 600 metres above sea level in England. They are stable habitats due to the high altitude and harsh climate, and burning management should not be required</li>
  <li>areas of heavy grazing - heavy grazing is likely to impede regeneration following a burn. Heavy trampling can exacerbate or even initiate soil erosion</li>
  <li>areas within five metres of watercourses - this is to ensure that the bankside vegetation remains intact. Bankside vegetation can act as a ‘buffer’ for surface runoff, slowing the input of surface runoff into the watercourse, thus reducing the risk of flash flooding downstream. If it is removed completely, it can also lead to erosion and widening of the stream channel</li>
  <li>windswept areas - vegetation in these areas is controlled by the high winds, so burning should not be necessary. Recovery is likely to be very slow</li>
  <li>areas of late mature/degenerate heather - these areas may be rich in diversity, including fire-sensitive species, and they also provide nesting cover. Regeneration after burning is likely to be poor. Burns can also be too hot due to the high volume of fuel</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="equipment-skills-training-and-communication">Equipment, skills, training and communication</h2>

<p>According to the Heather and Grass etc Burning (England) Regulations 2007, you must make sure that you carry out any burning safely, with enough people and equipment to control and regulate the burning during the entire period of the work.</p>

<p>You will need to employ staff with specialist knowledge and experience, and make sure that you have safety equipment to hand. You should also:</p>

<ul>
<li>arrange to have enough experienced beaters and enough safe, effective fire-dampening equipment and fire-retardant personal-safety equipment to allow for spares or alternatives - in case things get broken or an emergency develops</li>
  <li>make sure all your workers are trained in the use of equipment and safety procedures, and are familiar with the emergency plan</li>
  <li>provide a first aid kit and make sure that at least one of the team is trained in the prevention and first aid treatment of burns, dehydration and heat exhaustion</li>
  <li>ensure the person supervising the burn is experienced both in predicting fire behaviour - such as flame length, fire intensity, rate of spread - and in fire control techniques</li>
  <li>consult your local fire service well in advance of the burning season</li>
  <li>consult all your neighbours well in advance of your burn, if smoke or fire from your burn is likely to affect them - if this includes common land, you will need to consult the local Commoners’ Association, if there is one</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practicalities-of-safe-and-responsible-burning">Practicalities of safe and responsible burning</h2>

<p>When burning any ground on your farm, the following general advice applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>do not burn when conditions are too dry - eg when moss and plant litter has dried out - particularly on peaty soils</li>
  <li>do not burn if the weather is unsuitable - if you are unsure, you could consider lighting a small test fire to help you decide whether to proceed with burning</li>
  <li>burn in a steady, light breeze if possible - do not burn in strong or gusty winds, or when there is no wind at all. Be aware of potential changes in wind direction</li>
  <li>remember that fire creates its own draught that may affect its direction</li>
</ul>
<p>You should minimise any risks to people and wildlife as much as possible by:</p>

<ul>
<li>burning with three or more workers. If using fewer burners, they should be highly experienced and back-up help should be readily available</li>
  <li>ensuring that workers wear suitable protective clothing. All workers should have face masks, goggles and gloves with them, and first aid and emergency equipment should be available</li>
  <li>making sure that workers drink fluids regularly and are aware of the symptoms of dehydration and heat exhaustion - ie dry or sticky mouth, headache, dizziness, nausea, muscle weakness or cramps</li>
  <li>only burning if it is not likely to harm or disturb protected species. You should be particularly careful not to disturb wild birds and animals when they are breeding</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also make sure that you keep the burn controlled by:</p>

<ul>
<li>keeping burns small and well-distributed over the area</li>
  <li>not burning unless you know how and where the fire will be extinguished</li>
  <li>trying not to damage the moss or litter layer, expose the bare soil surface or burn the roots of plants</li>
  <li>ensuring that there are always enough firebreaks. The width of firebreaks should be at least two and a half times the expected flame length</li>
  <li>controlling the flanks of the fire, leaving the fire front to spread in a predetermined direction</li>
  <li>proceeding with great caution - if flames start to exceed three metres while you are burning, they can burn hot and be difficult to control</li>
  <li>ensuring that the wind is blowing downhill. If this is not possible, burning on the level is the next-best option or, failing this, on a gentle upward slope</li>
  <li>burning close to sensitive areas only when there is a gentle and constant wind blowing away from the sensitive area</li>
  <li>starting burning early - you should aim to extinguish fires before sunset and always ensure they are properly extinguished by dusk</li>
  <li>making sure that all fires are properly supervised until they have been fully extinguished</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="burning-lowland-heathlands">Burning lowland heathlands</h2>

<p>Lowland heathland, which is generally less than 300 metres above sea level and supports plants like heather, dwarf gorses and cross-leaved heath, is a rare and threatened habitat and so is a priority for nature conservation.</p>

<p>When burning lowland heathlands, you should burn with particular care and remember to only burn during the lowlands burning season - 1 November to 31 March during the hours between sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>There are several benefits to burning lowland heathlands. It:</p>

<ul>
<li>creates bare ground that invertebrates, reptiles and birds need for nesting, basking or hunting</li>
  <li>creates even-aged stands of heather and other dwarf shrubs, and short, fairly open vegetation, which provides an ideal seed bed for more shrubs</li>
  <li>rejuvenates heather plants</li>
  <li>creates potash, which adds nutrition to the soil</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you should take care when burning this type of land as:</p>

<ul>
<li>severe burns can damage roots and destroy the heather seed bank</li>
  <li>burns on slopes can cause increased soil erosion if heavy rains wash away soil exposed by the burn</li>
  <li>it can consume the leaf litter which can affect the long-term nutrient status of the soil</li>
</ul>
<p>Before burning in this type of area, you should carry out a risk assessment. This should cover the equipment and staffing you plan to use, and any practical concerns.</p>

<p>You should also think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>hazards on site, such as overhead power lines</li>
  <li>whether there are sensitive species in the area that could be harmed - eg reptiles or nesting birds</li>
  <li>putting up warning signs</li>
  <li>firebreaks - these should be cut in the autumn and early winter</li>
  <li>informing neighbours and the local fire brigade</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also take care not to burn on sensitive areas such as summits, ridges, other windswept areas or areas particularly exposed to salt spray. </p>

<h2 id="burning-reedbeds-and-saw-sedge">Burning reedbeds and saw-sedge</h2>

<p>Reedbeds are amongst the most important habitats for birds in the UK and are a priority area for conservation.</p>

<p>Reedbeds and saw-sedge beds are also commercially valuable, and the Environmental Stewardship Scheme offers incentives to farmers and land managers for commercial reed and sedge cutting. For more information, see the guide on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-stewardship">Environmental Stewardship: the basics</a>.</p>

<p>Before burning, you need to check if your reedbed or sedge bed is notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, Special Protection Area or Special Area of Conservation. If it is, you should check with Natural England to find out if you need consent to burn.</p>

<p>There are many benefits to burning reedbeds and sedge beds. It:</p>

<ul>
<li>can restore reedbeds so that they can brought back into rotational cutting</li>
  <li>can increase the early growth of new shoots, leading to greater flowering of reed and increased seed production</li>
  <li>creates open areas within reedbed which waterbirds can use for feeding</li>
  <li>can create a patchy structure of old and new reeds within the reedbed, which is beneficial for some reedbed birds</li>
  <li>avoids the trampling damage that a cutting and removal restoration method would cause</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are risks to burning these areas. It can be catastrophic for invertebrates and small mammals that are caught up in the burn, particularly in winter when they are inactive. Reed can also burn rapidly and easily get out of control.</p>

<p>Burning standing reed should take place before 31 March, so that you don’t disturb birds looking for nesting sites. You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>always burn with someone who has previous experience</li>
  <li>cut the standing reeds first using a two-way cut, so that each pair of cut rows lean into each other like a thatched roof</li>
  <li>burn the cut reed while it’s standing and while the ground is wet, to minimise damage to the soil</li>
  <li>make sure you burn and cut in small blocks or strips</li>
  <li>burn no more than five hectares or one third of the total area you are restoring, so you leave plenty of refuge areas for invertebrates and birds</li>
  <li>cut a firebreak around the area to be burned that is at least three to four times wider than the height of the standing reed, or if possible use reed-free ditches that are more than three metres wide</li>
  <li>burn directly into the wind</li>
</ul>
<p>When burning cut reed (litter), you should make sure you have cut firebreaks, as with standing reed, and avoid damage to peat by burning on wet ground or on a portable burning tray.</p>
