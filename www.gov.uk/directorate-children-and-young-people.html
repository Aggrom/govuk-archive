<p>Directorate Children and Young people (<abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr>) provides appropriate professional direction, support and advice in order to ensure that children and young people are provided with every opportunity to achieve the best possible outcomes and fulfil their potential.</p>

<p>The Children and Young People’s Strategy and Improvement Plan seeks to provide the framework for the delivery of children and young people’s services across Defence. The Plan aims to co-ordinate and concentrate the efforts of a broad range of organisations which contribute to the well-being of Service children and young people.</p>

<p>One of <abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr>’s top priorities is to ensure access for children and young people to a range of learning pathways so that they are able to meet the challenges of adulthood.</p>

<p><abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr> are striving to ensure the work carried out by Ministry of Defence agencies connected to children and young people is in line with relevant safeguarding policies.</p>

<p>We are working with Ministry of Defence, Service Children’s Education overseas, Other Government Departments and various charities who are involved in all aspects of supporting children and young people. </p>

<p>This work includes tackling the various challenges experienced by children and young people separated from a parent or family member who is deployed on operational duties.</p>

<h2 id="safeguarding">Safeguarding</h2>

<p><abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr> on behalf of the Ministry of Defence is committed to establishing processes which will ensure as far as possible and practical that all our children and young people are supported, protected and that they feel safe.</p>

<p>The MOD Safeguarding Children Board (<abbr title="Safeguarding Children Board">SCB</abbr>), which is chaired by an independent Safeguarding professional, was established in September 2009 in order to put in place consistent world-wide governance arrangements for safeguarding on behalf of the Service community overseas and to ensure that minimum legislative requirements as set out in UK Guidance including Working Together to Safeguard Children (and Young People) are in place. </p>

<p>The Board will achieve this through providing the strategic leadership, co-ordination and advice on policy direction and will ensure the effectiveness of Command-level safeguarding arrangements and services through assessing their compliance with the legislation.</p>

<p>The Board will also undertake a “champion and advocate role” in respect of the following groups: </p>

<ul>
<li>Children and young people (0-18) who belong to the Service community but reside within the UK where the Local Authorities have the statutory responsibility</li>
  <li>Children and young people (0-18) who engage in youth and cadet activities provided by the MOD within the UK and who are not members of the Service community.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Safeguarding Children Board">SCB</abbr> reports to the Children and Young People Trust Board (CYPTB) which in turn is accountable to the Secretary of State but in accordance with the Working Together Guidance (2010) retains independent accountability as a Safeguarding Board for its work.</p>

<h2 id="promoting-healthy-lifestyles">Promoting healthy lifestyles</h2>

<p>Promoting and supporting healthy life-styles to secure the physical, spiritual, social and emotional well-being of all Service children and young people.</p>

<p><abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr> and its partners are working towards:</p>

<ul>
<li>encouraging children and young people to lead healthy lifestyles through appropriate lifestyle choices and providing them with the opportunity to participate in a range of activities that promote their spiritual, social, emotional and physical wellbeing;</li>
  <li>ensuring that young people are equipped to make positive choices, about their sexual health, their lives and minimise risk-taking behaviours;</li>
  <li>ensuring children and young people who suffer from poor mental, physical or emotional health have access to high quality healthcare that is, where possible, local and responsive to need.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-pathways">Learning pathways</h2>

<p><abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr> are committed to working with MOD and external partners, including the Government and Devolved Administrations, Local Authorities, schools and various organisations to ensure that young people are supported into the learning pathway which best meets their needs.</p>

<h2 id="service-mobility-support">Service mobility support</h2>

<p>The Children’s Education Advisory Service (<abbr title="Children's Education Advisory Service">CEAS</abbr>), which is an integral part of <abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr>, in mitigating the impact of mobility on Service children and young people, is committed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Targeting support to parents, children and young people prior to/immediately following a move;</li>
  <li>Improving awareness and liaison between Government Departments, MOD Service units in UK and overseas, the Devolved Administrations, Local Authorities, schools and Health Authorities;</li>
  <li>Working together in partnership with charities and voluntary organisations to provide support to Service children and young people; </li>
</ul>
<p>As well as seeking advice from <abbr title="Children's Education Advisory Service">CEAS</abbr>, parents are advised to visit their local HIVEs and libraries, and trawl the internet for national and local schools support networks.</p>

<p>If you are a voluntary or charitable organisation which may be able to offer help to Service families who are getting ready to move, in the middle of a move, or have just moved, we would like to hear from you. </p>

<h2 id="organisations-working-together-to-achieve-the-best-possible-outcomes-for-service-children-and-young-people">Organisations working together to achieve the best possible outcomes for Service children and young people</h2>

<p><abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr> works in partnership with various organisations. Below is a list of some of those organisations.</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>The Children’s Education Advisory Service: <abbr title="Children's Education Advisory Service">CEAS</abbr> was established several years ago to provide Service families with advice and information about all aspects of children’s education in the UK and around the world, now forms an integral part of Directorate Children and Young People.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Service Children’s Education: Service Children’s Education provides education for the dependent children of Armed Forces personnel and UK based civilians serving overseas and is the key delivery partner to Directorate Children and Young People.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, <abbr title="Directorate Children and Young People">DCYP</abbr> works with a broad range of Other Government Departments, in particular the Department for Education, organisations within the MOD and external organisations and charities, to ensure that children, wherever they are in the world, are given every opportunity to fulfil their potential. Examples of the organisations and agencies which Directorate Children and Young People work closely with in this respect are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Department for Education (DfE) is responsible for education and children’s services in England. The Directorate works in partnership with DfE to ensure that policies for Service children and young people are up to date and in line with Government policy. DfE sit on both the MOD Children and Young People’s Trust Board and the Safeguarding Children Board.</li>
  <li>Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (<abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association">SSAFA</abbr>)offers help and support to serving members of the Armed Forces and those who used to serve, and care for the families of both. The professional Director of Social Work for <abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> is a member of both the MOD Children and Young People’s Trust Board and the Safeguarding Children Board.</li>

  <li>The Naval Families Federation (<abbr title="Naval Families Federation">NFF</abbr>) was established in 2003 to give Royal Naval and Royal Marines’ families an independent voice. Views and concerns expressed by families may be taken forward by the <abbr title="Naval Families Federation">NFF</abbr> either through the chain of command or at ministerial level. <abbr title="Naval Families Federation">NFF</abbr> are represented on the MOD Children and Young People’s Trust Board.</li>
