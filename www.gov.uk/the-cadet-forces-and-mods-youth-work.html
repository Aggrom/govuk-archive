<h2 id="the-cadet-forces">The Cadet Forces</h2>

<p>The Ministry of Defence sponsors and supports four Cadet Forces (voluntary youth organisations). They offer challenging and enjoyable activities for young people, and prepare them to play an active part in the community while developing valuable life skills. The Cadet Forces comprise:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Sea Cadets </li>
  <li>the Army Cadet Force </li>
  <li>the Air Training Corps </li>
  <li>the Combined Cadet Force</li>
</ul>
<p>They aim to provide challenging and enjoyable activities for young people living in the UK and certain locations abroad, and to better prepare them for their role in the community. Not only do cadets have the opportunity to learn new skills and engage in adventurous activities in disciplined and well-structured organisations, but they may also gain BTEC qualifications based on their achievements. These qualifications equate to 4 GCSEs and may help them in their future education and career. Adults who volunteer to help with the cadets also have the opportunity to receive useful training and gain recognised qualifications.</p>

<p>Cadets have the chance to learn new skills and engage in adventurous activities in disciplined and well-structured organisations based on the traditions, values and standards of the Armed Forces. Cadets can also work towards a range of nationally-recognised qualifications which will help with their future education and careers.</p>

<h3 id="sea-cadets">Sea Cadets</h3>

<p>Website: <a rel="external" href="http://www.sea-cadets.org/">http://www.sea-cadets.org/</a></p>

<p>Sea Cadets (including Royal Marines cadets) aims to give young people the best possible head start in life through fun and adventurous nautical activity. From learning new skills and working in teams, Sea Cadets offers an environment where young people find confidence and inspiration.</p>

<p>Sea Cadets follows the customs and traditions of the Royal Navy, its biggest supporter. Across the country, 14,000 young people in 400 units in towns, cities and ports challenge themselves and develop new skills, like sailing, boating and rock climbing. They are supported by 9,000 volunteers whose dedication makes Sea Cadets possible.</p>

<h3 id="the-army-cadet-force">The Army Cadet Force</h3>

<p>Website: <a rel="external" href="http://armycadets.com/">http://armycadets.com/</a></p>

<p>For action and adventure, fun and friendship, the Army Cadet Force (ACF) is hard to beat. With around 46,000 cadets (aged 12-18) and 8,500 adult volunteers in 1,700 locations in every corner of the United Kingdom, the ACF is one of the country’s largest voluntary youth organisations. It is also one of the oldest, and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2010.</p>

<p>We welcome boys and girls from the age of 12 (and in at least year eight at school), of all abilities and backgrounds and, through a broad range of exciting, challenging, educational and adventurous activities, help them develop physically, mentally and socially. Some of our activities have a military theme, others have more of a community focus. Combining military and community activities in this way, enables us to offer our young people a unique blend of personal development opportunities, all designed to promote fun and friendship while also helping them prepare for success in their chosen path in life, whatever that might turn out to be.</p>

<h3 id="the-air-training-corps">The Air Training Corps</h3>

<p>Website: <a rel="external" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/">http://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/</a></p>

<p>If you’re a fan of aviation, action and adventure, love sports and getting to know people, then you’re in the right place. Every year, nearly 60,000 air cadets and volunteer staff take part in exciting events in over 900 squadrons across the UK. </p>

<p>Our aims are to: </p>

<ul>
<li>promote and encourage a practical interest in aviation and the Royal Air Force among young people </li>
  <li>provide training which will be useful in the Services and civilian life </li>
  <li>encourage the spirit of adventure and develop qualities of leadership and good citizenship
…..and there’s one more important thing - it’s a lot of fun!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-combined-cadet-force">The Combined Cadet Force</h3>

<p>Website: <a rel="external" href="http://www.clsb.org.uk/combined-cadet-force/">http://www.clsb.org.uk/combined-cadet-force/</a></p>

<p>The Combined Cadet Force (<abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr>) is a unique educational partnership that operates in schools across the UK. Through enjoyable military themed and adventurous activities, cadets have the opportunity to take responsibility, develop skills such as leadership, self-reliance, resourcefulness, endurance and perseverance. <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> contingents contain one or more sections from the Army, the Royal Navy, Royal Marines or the Royal Air Force, and promote the aims and values of the Services they represent.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> has one of the longest histories of all the cadet forces sponsored by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, dating back to the 1850s when a number of schools formed units which were attached to Rifle Volunteer Battalions for Home Defence.</p>

<p>Since the 1950s, however, the <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> has been recognised as a voluntary youth organisation, the aim of which is to provide an opportunity for young people to exercise responsibility and leadership in a disciplined environment.</p>

<p>Today the <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> contingents form a vibrant, inclusive youth organisation for pupils aged between 13 and 18, offering significant developmental opportunities in a unique educational partnership with the schools in which they are based. Through the use of military-orientated and adventurous training, cadets also have the opportunity to develop their sense of responsibility and the qualities of self-reliance, resourcefulness, endurance, perseverance and a sense of service to the community. The acquisition of these personal attributes at a formative stage will remain of value throughout the cadets’ lives and will be relevant in whatever career they pursue.</p>

<p>There are currently 257 <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> contingents based in both state and independent schools and colleges throughout the UK. The <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> contingent may comprise up to 3 Service sections – Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force. Some <abbr title="Royal Navy">RN</abbr> sections also include Royal Marine detachments.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> is not part of the UK Armed Forces. While adult volunteers and cadets do wear uniform, they do not incur any liability for service or compulsory training in the Armed Forces as a result of being a <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> member.</p>

<p>Each school contingent is run by a team of enthusiastic adult volunteers drawn, in the main, from teachers within the school, although outside volunteers are often invited to help. Schools may also employ a School Staff Instructor, either full or part-time, who is usually a retired Senior Non-Commissioned Officer. Adult volunteers have the opportunity to gain nationally-recognised qualifications in leadership, management and outdoor pursuits.</p>

<p>Training opportunities for cadets occur during weekly parades in school, whole day and weekend training periods (field days), at annual military camps, on courses run by the Armed Forces specifically for cadets and through adventurous training expeditions arranged on an ad hoc basis.  Cadets follow the syllabus appropriate to the section they join but all include drill, skill at arms and use of map and compass. Adventurous training opportunities include mountain walking, canoeing, gliding and offshore sailing. Cadets also have the opportunity to gain BTEC qualifications in Public Services and Music.</p>

<p>The success of any <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> contingent is due to the educational partnership that exists between the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and the school. A school cannot run a successful <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> without the full support of the Head. It is the Head who must nominate the Contingent Commander and identify the members of staff who are willing to become adult volunteers. However, adult volunteers may also come from outside the school. The <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> works best when it is fully integrated into the school curriculum. Time for <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> activities must be scheduled into the school programme.</p>

<p>In return for the school’s commitment, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> gives significant support to the <abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr> by providing uniform, weapons and ammunition, training advice and assistance, loans of stores and equipment, access to military transport and remuneration to School Staff Instructors (SSIs) and officers.</p>

<p>To summarise this educational partnership, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>uniforms</li>
  <li>weapons and ammunition</li>
  <li>training for adult volunteers</li>
  <li>training assistance</li>
  <li>access to military facilities</li>
  <li>access to military transport</li>
  <li>loans of stores and equipment</li>
  <li>remuneration for adult volunteers</li>
</ul>
<p>The school provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>the young people</li>
  <li>time within the curriculum</li>
  <li>accommodation and storage</li>
  <li>the adult volunteers</li>
  <li>enduring commitment and enthusiasm</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-cadet-expansion-initiative">The Cadet Expansion Initiative</h2>

<p>In June 2012, on Armed Forces Day, the Prime Minister announced the government’s intention to set up 100 new cadet units in state-funded secondary schools by 2015. If you are part of a school, or would like further information on this joint <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DFE</abbr>) initiative, you can find out more about the <a rel="external" href="http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/youngpeople/militaryethos/cadetforces">Cadet Expansion Initiative</a> on the <abbr title="Department for Education">DFE</abbr> website.

</section><h2 id="adult-volunteers-with-the-cadet-forces">Adult volunteers with the Cadet Forces</h2>

<p>The Cadet Forces could not exist without the support of over 25,000 adults who volunteer to help train cadets, run meetings, activities and events. These dedicated people give cadets the chance to get involved in activities ranging from canoeing to rock climbing, map reading to flying, and first aid to The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award. For those less keen on the more physical activities, there are also opportunities to use practical skills and help with administration, fundraising or local management groups.</p>

<p>Like cadets, adult volunteers can also gain nationally-recognised qualifications up to the equivalent of a Master’s degree.</p>

<h2 id="mod-working-with-young-people">
<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>: working with young people</h2>

<p>There is a need for our young people to be offered tangible and realistic opportunities for enabling them to grow and get the best possible start in life.</p>

<p>As <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is one of the largest public sector organisations it is able to play a leading role in providing opportunities for young people. Indeed, the range of activities provided for and by the Cadets (which is <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s main youth-related activity) is wider than any other United Kingdom youth organisation. </p>

<p>One of the reasons the Cadets are so popular is because of the unparalleled opportunities they provide in terms of team-building, leadership; citizenship and, certainly more recently, recognised education and professional qualifications. Similarly, other <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> supported activities for young people (such as work with The Prince’s Trust) are all aimed specifically at helping build the lives and confidence of young people.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is involved with helping young people as it recognises the part it can play in this important social agenda.</p>

<h3 id="mod-initiatives">
<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> initiatives</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s unique ‘Education Outreach’ programme is an initiative that instils life-long skills in students studying in a number of Further Education (FE) Colleges across the UK. Over 2,000 students every year, many from ethnic minority backgrounds, improve their chances of finding employment through training, mentoring and receiving an insight into the workings of a large employer. One of the core strands is mentoring and every year over 40 London-based <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> staff, military and civilian, mentor over 80 students.</p>

<h3 id="other-initiatives">Other initiatives</h3>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> extends its arm to providing support and a military-themed ethos to other youth organisations and projects</p>

<p>These include the Army Cadet Force Outreach project, an early-intervention programme specifically designed for crime-vulnerable 12 -14 year olds and run in conjunction with local schools, police forces and community groups. It provides adventurous training and challenging activities using Army loaned facilities and equipment. It majors on confidence-building and raising self-esteem.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> also lend their support to the Prince’s Trust charity. Through practical support, the Trust helps 14-30 year olds realise their potential and transform their lives. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> supports 120 Prince’s Trust personal development programmes for young people across the UK with <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> staff, including serving members of the Armed Forces, acting as leaders/mentors.</p>

<p>The Cadet Forces have been involved in Youth United (formerly Project YOU) since February 2009. Youth United is a coalition of youth organisations, mainly uniformed, with the aim to reach out further in the UK to encourage more young people and adult volunteers to take advantage of the opportunities available.</p>

<h2 id="contact-details">Contact details</h2>

<p>The Youth and Cadets team, based at the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, is a component of the Reserve Forces and Cadets Division. It offers advice to government on youth policy and the cadet forces. </p>

<h2 id="cadet-statistics">Cadet statistics</h2>

<p>A few interesting facts you might not know about the Cadet Forces.</p>

<p>Collectively there are around 140,000 Cadets, broken down as:</p>

<ul>
<li>45,020 - Combined Cadet Force</li>
  <li>13,920 - Sea Cadet Corps</li>
  <li>45,110 - Army Cadet Force</li>
  <li>35,750 - Air Training Corps</li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling so many Cadets to take part are more than 26,000 Adult Volunteers:</p>

<ul>
<li>2,100 - Combined Cadet Force</li>
  <li>5,190 - Sea Cadet Corps</li>
  <li>8,380 - Army Cadet Force</li>
  <li>10,510 - Air Training Corps</li>
</ul>
<p>Cadets typically range in age from 12-18 years old.</p>

<p>Adult Volunteers typically range from 18-65 years old.</p>

<p>259 schools have Combined Cadet Forces, 64 of which are state schools</p>

<p>A Combined Cadet Force (<abbr title="Combined Cadet Force">CCF</abbr>) can contain one or more sections from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army or Royal Air Force.</p>

<p>People from all walks of life serve in the Cadet Forces, either through their school in the Combined Cadet Forces, or by joining individual Service Cadet organisations. </p>

<p>If you take a cross section of the most prominent people in Britain today, you’d be surprised how many of them were once cadets, such as the Dean of Westminster, the novelist Sebastian Faulks, Chris Martin from Coldplay, David Walliams, Jeremy Irons, Tom Lucy, Olympic Silver Medallist in rowing in the 2008 Games, Jamie Hickman, the Olympic and Commonwealth Gold Medal swimmer, and Len Deighton, author of ‘The Ipcress File’.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-the-cadet-forces">History of the Cadet Forces</h2>

<p>The history of the cadet forces dates back to the 1850s with the formation of several forerunners of the existing organisations.
The Cadet Corps, the forerunners of the Combined Cadet Corps, were formed firstly in certain schools as a means of training young people to support the masses of volunteers who were required to boost the Army following heavy losses in the Crimea and the possibility of further war. These Cadet Corps were recognised by the War Office and permitted to wear the uniforms of their parent Volunteer battalions, later to become the Territorial Army. Gradually there developed additional battalions outwith schools. As the threat of war receded, some Cadet Corps developed into Rifle Clubs, and cadet battalions not associated with schools became Social Welfare Organisations - the forerunners of the current Army Cadet Force.</p>

<p>Meantime, also during the 1850s, a number of orphanages were established to look after children orphaned as a result of the Crimean War. These were run with the help of sailors returning from the Crimea. An organisation was then formed called the ‘Naval Lads’ Brigades’ and over the following 50 years or so 34 Brigades of Boys were established and granted recognition by the Admiralty in 1919 and the title ‘Navy League Sea Cadet Corps’ adopted.</p>

<p>Following the First World War there was a reluctance on the part of the public to support any military organisation because of the huge losses incurred in the War, and the Cadet Forces for a while received no support from the Government, but had to be entirely self-supporting.</p>

<p>Then, in 1938, a retired officer from the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force, Air Commodore Chamier, had the foresight to see the need for people trained in airmanship and started the Air Defence Cadet Corps. This comprised units set up in some schools to provide part-time training for young men intending to join the Royal Air Force. They were hugely successful and their value noted by the government at the time. Developing from the Air Defence Cadet Corps, the Air Training Corps was formed in 1941 by Royal Warrant.</p>

<p>By 1942 the other Cadet Forces started to thrive once again and be heavily supported by the government.</p>

<p>Today the Cadet Forces are very different to those early groups of young people. The focus now is on developing tomorrow’s citizens through the provision of challenging and interesting activities, although the values and ethos of the Armed Forces are used as a means to achieve this aim. Up to 40% of a cadet’s time is spent on adventurous training activities. Cadets not only have the opportunity for self-development, but also to get involved with volunteer and charitable work in the community. The work that cadets do can lead to the gaining of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award and a vocational qualification – a BTEC in Public Services. Adult volunteers also have the opportunity to gain recognized qualifications.</p>

<p>Many cadets do go on to join the Armed Forces, and we are delighted to welcome them, but there is absolutely no pressure for cadets to follow military careers. The Ministry of Defence accepts that the Cadet Force organisations add value to the youth of today and for this reason continue to support them wholeheartedly.</p>
