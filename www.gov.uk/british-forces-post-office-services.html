<abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> enquiries announcement</h2>
<p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> enquiries will close at midday on Monday 24 December 2012 and re-open Wednesday 2 January 2013 at 7.30am.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The British Forces Post Office (<abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>) provides a mail service to serving British Forces personnel and their families worldwide, including exercises and operations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> headquarters is based in a purpose built facility at RAF Northolt, in North West London. <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> also has a number of defence mail centres at Andover, Aldershot, Catterick, Colchester, Donnington, Glasgow, Central London, Northolt, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Wyton.</p>

<p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> also provides the e-bluey hybrid mail service.</p>

<h2 id="bfpo-mobile-app">
<abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Mobile App</h2>

<p>The new <a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bfpo/id567839256"><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> app</a> is free and easy to use.</p>

<p>For a long time, <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> have wanted to get mail information out quickly and efficiently to their large serving customer base and their families. From those in well known locations like Germany, Brunei and the Falkland Islands, and operational theatres, to the deployed ships of the Royal Navy and the global locations of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

<p>Supporting service personnel and their families all over the globe is no easy task. The <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> have had their work cut out to develop the right product. The app was the brainchild of Lieutenant-Colonel Colin Code, who realised there was a real need for this. He was also the wizard behind the design and functionality of the product.</p>

<p>For example, the app can locate all <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers globally - the user simply inserts the country they are posting to. It lists all British retailers who post products to <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> addresses and gives a reminder of dangerous air-cargo restrictions. It will calculate the cost of your parcel once you enter the size, weight and destination and it even gives final mailing deadlines for key annual dates like Christmas.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> app, developed by Locassa, is now available at the <a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bfpo/id567839256">App Store in iTunes</a>, and on Google play for Android phones. </p>

<p>Please tell us your suggestions for improvements to the app through <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> enquiries email at <a href="mailto:DESBFPO-Enquiries@mod.uk">DESBFPO-Enquiries@mod.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="bfpo-mission">
<abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> mission</h3>

<p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> is to provide an efficient and effective postal and courier service in order to sustain the fighting power of UK Armed Forces worldwide.</p>

<h3 id="the-bfpo-philatelic-bureau">The <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Philatelic Bureau</h3>

<p>Responsibility for the Forces Philatelic Bureau has been transferred to a new not-for-profit organisation, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bfps.org.uk/" title="British Forces Philatelic Service">British Forces Philatelic Service (BFPS)</a>, which has been set up to ensure that our philatelic service survives and thrives. BFPS is a Community Interest Company.</p>

<p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> retains responsibility for philatelic policy.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-address-bfpo-mail">How to address <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> mail</h2>

<p>It is important that all mail sent through the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> system is addressed correctly to ensure a smooth delivery to the destination address. The following information is provided as a guide to the do’s and don’ts when addressing mail to all <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbered locations, including exercises and operations.</p>

<p>Use the following format when addressing your mail:  </p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Service No Rank Name  
<br>Unit/Regt  
<br>Operation Name (If applicable)  
<br><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> No  
<br></p></div></div>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

1234567 Pte Joe Bloggs  
<br>1st Battalion  
<br>Operation HERRICK  
<br><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> 772  
<br></p></div></div>

<p>Ensure you write a return address on the reverse of the mail item. </p>

<p>Write the address clearly in capital letters, this will aid in the automatic sortation equipment reading the address first time and speed your mail arrival.</p>

<h3 id="how-not-to-address-your-mail">How not to address your mail</h3>

<p>Do not write any other address details after the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> number on the address, as this can lead to mail being diverted to the wrong <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> location. For example, the following address will lead to the item being redirected to <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> 12, Belize: </p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

1234567 Pte Joe Bloggs  
<br>1st Battalion  
<br>Operation Telic  
<br><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> 641  
<br>Op Telic 12  
<br></p></div></div>

<p>The automatic sortation equipment will read the last line of the address and direct the item to <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> 12 in Belize. </p>

<p>Do not:</p>

<ul>
<li>include destination country in the address - <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers are similar to a UK postcode whereby the sortation software simply reads the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> number and sorts to the appropriate location</li>
  <li>use the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> headquarters address for onward transmission to the recipient - Royal Mail sortation software will recognise a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> address and automatically direct the item to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> sorting office in North London. The item will then be sent to the Returned Letters Branch, if no return address has been supplied the item will be held for a period of 3 months before being destroyed.  </li>
  <li>write any other information on the front of the mail item as this can lead to the item not being automatically sorted and will delay the onward trasmission to the required destination  </li>
  <li>send items to unnamed individuals eg ‘to a soldier on the front line’ - the free post service for Op KIPION/Op HERRICK and the yearly Christmas free post service to operations is only available for friends and family of troops serving on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The new UK non-geographic post codes are for on-line use only and are not part of the mail address; and therefore should not be used as part of the normal mail address. All UK mail sorting processes are automated and set to only read <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers; any alteration to the standard address may cause the mail item to be delayed.</p>

<h2 id="look-up-bfpo-numbers">Look up <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers</h2>

<p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers are seperated into two areas, the first are issued for HM Ships with the second being issued for all other locations.</p>

<h3 id="static-bfpo-numbers">Static <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers</h3>
<p>These are used for a given location, and/or group of isolated detachments, and will not move.</p>

<h3 id="hm-ships">HM ships</h3>
<p>These <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers refer to a specific ship or Naval Party, regardless of their location around the world, although some may refer to land-based naval establishments.</p>

<h2 id="e-bluey-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it">E-bluey: what it is and how to use it</h2>

<p>When British Forces are deployed on operations they are entitled to free aerogrammes (colloquially known as “blueys” because of their colour) to and from their families and friends. This service has been in place for a considerable time. Blueys as we know them today were issued for the first time during the early days of the Northern Ireland deployment. More recently <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, working in conjunction with SuperLetter.com, has pioneered an electronic form of the bluey known as ‘e-bluey’.</p>

<p>The e-bluey is a Hybrid mail system that allows service personnel, relatives and friends to maintain a personal and private contact with each other while serving on operations or exercise for more than 60 days duration. Probably the most important factor is that the system is two-way. This means those service personnel with access to the Internet can send e-blueys back home.  </p>

<h3 id="how-e-bluey-works">How e-bluey works</h3>

<p>You can either compose your message online or offline using a word processor or the Quick Letter Writer. This message is sent to the e-bluey server, where it is stored prior to being down-loaded by the Forces Post Office (<abbr title="Forces Post Office">FPO</abbr>) in the appropriate operational theatre, or by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and Denfence Mail Centres for e-blueys addressed to the UK.</p>

<p>It is then printed and sealed before being passed into the local <abbr title="Forces Post Office">FPO</abbr>/Royal Mail mailstream. The system is private and personal as the text is only seen by the originator and the recipient, there are two stages of encryption to ensure that the message remains private and personal. The specialist machinery prints and seals it automatically without the e-bluey being seen by the operator. The service is free to the user, although the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> pays a fee for each letter transmitted. The time of transmission of a letter to the adddressee can be dramatically reduced, as it is not necessary to physically transport the letter through the military mail system between theatres.</p>

<h3 id="who-can-use-e-bluey">Who can use e-bluey</h3>

<p>Service Personnel, Relatives and friends of service personnel who are deployed on operations are entitled to use the e-bluey service. Both the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> and e-bluey web-sites have a list of entitled <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> locations that can be reached through the service. Revenue protection measures are implemented from time to time at the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Headquarters in London and by the e-bluey administrator to ensure that the system is being used correctly.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-photo-to-your-e-bluey">Add a photo to your e-bluey</h3>

<p>Photo-bluey is a feature within e-bluey that allows you to insert a photo, either colour or black and white, at the top of an e-bluey. The photo to be inserted must be on your computer and can be any size. However the area available on an e-bluey to insert the photo is limited to 185mm wide x 115mm high (7.2 x 4.5 inchs or 700 x 434 pixels).</p>

<p>Photos smaller than this will be printed actual size, whilst photos larger will be automatically reduced proportionally to fit as closely to the 185mm x 115mm area. Please remember that the larger the photo the longer it will take to upload to the e-bluey server, so please be patient when you are uploading large photos.</p>

<h2 id="e-bluey-additional-services">E-bluey: additional services</h2>

<h3 id="fax-bluey">Fax-bluey</h3>

<p>Fax-bluey is basically the same as an e-bluey, however it allows the sender to send an e-bluey in your own handwriting instead of using a computer.</p>

<p>To use the fax-bluey service:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a fax-bluey from your Unit Post Orderly, <abbr title="Forces Post Office">FPO</abbr> or Hive personnel  </li>
  <li>write your letter in the large box starting from the top of the form  </li>
  <li>write clearly and in large print the name and address of the person you are writing to in the ‘to’ box at the bottom of the form  </li>
  <li>write your own name and address in the ‘from’ box  </li>
  <li>when you have completed your letter, take it to your nearest fax-scanner to be scanned in and sent to the e-bluey server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once loaded onto the server your letter then follows the same procedure as a normal e-bluey.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-fax2email">What is Fax2email?</h3>
<p>Fax2email is virtually the same as the Fax-bluey, except that in the ‘to’ box you must write clearly and in large print the e-mail address of the person to whom you are writing.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-pay-bluey">What is pay-bluey?</h3>

<p>Pay-bluey works in the same format as e-bluey, it is a Hybrid mail system that allows service personnel, relatives and friends to maintain a personal and private contact with each other while serving overseas at British Forces Post Offices that are not covered by the Operational Welfare Package.</p>

<p>The main difference between each system is that e-bluey is free to use but, as it states in the name, you have to pay for the pay-bluey service. However, please remember you are only able to use the pay-bluey service to a location where an e-bluey system has been installed.</p>

<h2 id="bfpos-enduring-free-mail-service">
<abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>’s Enduring Free Mail service</h2>

<ol>
<li>Companies who foresee a potential ‘one off’, or infrequent use of the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> System can either;</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Physically post the article at a Post Office and pay the appropriate (HM Forces) postage rate (note: using either Royal Mail Documentation (CN22/23) or ParcelForce Worldwide PFU 509 Despatch Pack). Payment for this method allows for both the shipment to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and the onward shipment to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>b. Utilise the arrangement <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> has with Parcelforce Worldwide*, named the ‘One Stop Shop’ Process. Under this process, Companies contract directly with ParcelForce Worldwide (see below for contact details), who, in turn,  are in direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. Payment for this method also allows for both the shipment to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and the onward shipment to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<p>*NOTE: Many Companies are already in direct Contract with ParcelForce for collections of goods direct from their premises for addresses in the UK mainland only. This does not allow for the correct documentation or onward shipment (and extra cost) for despatch from HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer. We recommend that you speak to your Parcelforce Representative for further information.</p>

<p>OR 
c. Utilise any <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> may have with other Courier Companies who have chosen to be in direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. Under this process, Companies contract directly with the Courier Company on the list who, in turn, is in direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. Payment for this method is made direct to the Courier Company, who are themselves invoiced by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. This allows for both the shipment to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and the onward shipment to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<ol>
<li>Companies who foresee potential frequent use of the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> System enter into a <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract directly with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial (see below for contact details), for the onward shipment by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with prior use of either your Company’s own transport or a carrier of your Company’s choice for the inland journey to deliver articles to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>

<p>All potential users of the HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail System must read the rules on mail prohibitions and restrictions.</p>

<p>Adhere without exclusion to the weight and size restrictions that apply to Commercial Mail.</p>

<p>Note that articles outside of these maximum weight and size restrictions will be refused upon entry at the HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail reception desk.</p>

<p>Note that Purchase Order numbers cannot be accommodated under the electronic Invoicing process that supports the automated <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail System and will therefore not appear on any invoice issued by the Defence Business Service, Liverpool</p>

<p>Note that HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> will not enter into any compensation arrangements with, or make any direct compensation payments to, any Third Party who use a company that is itself already in direct Commercial Mail Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> to despatch their articles to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and beyond, to end <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> addresses overseas. <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>’s responsibility and authority remains within the Commercial Mail Contract with the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> only. Any arrangement between the Third Party and the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, regarding the despatch of the Third Party’s articles to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and beyond, is entirely the concern of those two parties only. HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> bears no responsibility, authority or commitment in that relationship, as its contractual relationship is with the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> only</p>

<p>Note that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> offers a very limited service for items destined for 5000 series <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers, one that does not offer any delivery guarantees or compensation coverage. This is due to the fact that once items have reached HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> for processing, they are then passed to a separate, 3rd party for subsequent processing and distribution, who operate very strict controls on mail volume allocations and types of items allowed. This places the items totally outside of <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>’s control, therefore no assurance as to final delivery timeframes can be given and <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> does not accept liability for compensation in the event of any item(s) going missing. Should the 3rd party, for whatever reason, refuse to accept any item upon presentation by HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, then the Sender shall be notified by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> and be responsible for its collection from <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or, <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> will return the item back to the Sender, at the Sender’s cost (The 3rd party, responsible for onward processing and distribution, may be contacted on 01908 8522222 - Option 3).</p>
