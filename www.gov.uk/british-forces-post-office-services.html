<h2 id="bfpo-what-they-do">BFPO: what they do</h2>

<p>The British Forces Post Office (BFPO) provides a mail service to serving British Forces personnel and their families worldwide, including exercises and operations.</p>

<p>The BFPO headquarters is based in a purpose built facility at RAF Northolt, in North West London. BFPO also has a number of defence mail centres at Andover, Aldershot, Catterick, Colchester, Donnington, Glasgow, Central London, Northolt, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Wyton.</p>

<p>BFPO also provides the e-bluey hybrid mail service.</p>

<h2 id="bfpo-app">BFPO App</h2>

<p>The new App that has been launched by the BFPO based at RAF Northolt is ‘fresh, innovative, free and easy to use’.</p>

<p>For a long time, BFPO have wanted to get mail information out quickly and efficiently to their large serving customer base and their families. From those in well known locations like Germany, Brunei and the Falkland Islands, and operational theatres, to the deployed ships of the Royal Navy and the global locations of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

<p>Supporting service personnel and their families all over the globe is no easy task. The BFPO have had their work cut out to develop the right product. The App was the brainchild of Lieutenant-Colonel Colin Code, who realised there was a real need for this. He was also the wizard behind the design and functionality of the product.</p>

<p>“The App is intuitive, it has a simple interface and is very responsive, it can find an answer to your mail query within seconds,” said Lt Col Code.</p>

<p>For example, the App can locate all BFPO numbers globally - the user simply inserts the country they are posting to. It lists all British retailers who post products to BFPO addresses and gives a reminder of dangerous air-cargo restrictions. It will calculate the cost of your parcel once you enter the size, weight and destination and it even gives final mailing deadlines for key annual dates like Christmas.</p>

<p>“We welcome comments and ideas, we aim to update the App soon,” added Lt Col Code.</p>

<p>The BFPO App, developed by Locassa, is now available at the App Store in iTunes, an Android version is to follow soon. Users can offer suggestions through BFPO enquiries email at DESBFPO-Enquiries@mod.uk</p>

<h3 id="bfpo-mission">BFPO mission</h3>

<p>BFPO is to provide an efficient and effective postal and courier service in order to sustain the fighting power of UK Armed Forces worldwide.</p>

<h3 id="the-bfpo-philatelic-bureau">The BFPO Philatelic Bureau</h3>

<p>Responsibility for the Forces Philatelic Bureau has been transferred to a new not-for-profit organisation, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bfps.org.uk/" title="British Forces Philatelic Service">British Forces Philatelic Service (BFPS)</a>, which has been set up to ensure that our philatelic service survives and thrives. BFPS is a Community Interest Company.</p>

<p>BFPO retains responsibility for philatelic policy.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-address-bfpo-mail">How to address BFPO mail</h2>

<p>It is important that all mail sent through the BFPO system is addressed correctly to ensure a smooth delivery to the destination address. The following information is provided as a guide to the do’s and don’ts when addressing mail to all BFPO numbered locations, including exercises and operations.</p>

<p>Use the following format when addressing your mail:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Service No Rank Name<br>
Unit/Regt<br>
Operation Name (If applicable)<br>
BFPO No  </li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>1234567 Pte Joe Bloggs<br>
1st Battalion<br>
Operation HERRICK<br>
BFPO 772  </li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure you write a return address on the reverse of the mail item. </p>

<p>Write the address clearly in capital letters, this will aid in the automatic sortation equipment reading the address first time and speed your mail arrival.</p>

<h3 id="how-not-to-address-your-mail">How <strong>not</strong> to address your mail</h3>

<p>Do not write any other address details after the BFPO number on the address, as this can lead to mail being diverted to the wrong BFPO location. For example, the following address will lead to the item being redirected to BFPO 12, Belize: </p>

<ul>
<li>1234567 Pte Joe Bloggs<br>
  1st Battalion<br>
  Operation Telic<br>
  BFPO 641<br>
  Op Telic 12  </li>
</ul>
<p>The automatic sortation equipment will read the last line of the address and direct the item to BFPO 12 in Belize. </p>

<p>Do not:</p>

<ul>
<li>include destination country in the address - BFPO numbers are similar to a UK postcode whereby the sortation software simply reads the BFPO number and sorts to the appropriate location</li>
  <li>use the BFPO headquarters address for onward transmission to the recipient - Royal Mail sortation software will recognise a BFPO address and automatically direct the item to the BFPO sorting office in North London. The item will then be sent to the Returned Letters Branch, if no return address has been supplied the item will be held for a period of 3 months before being destroyed.  </li>
  <li>write any other information on the front of the mail item as this can lead to the item not being automatically sorted and will delay the onward trasmission to the required destination  </li>
  <li>send items to unnamed individuals eg ‘to a soldier on the front line’ - the free post service for Op KIPION/Op HERRICK and the yearly Christmas free post service to operations is only available for friends and family of troops serving on operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The new UK non-geographic post codes are for on-line use ONLY and are not part of the mail address; and therefore should not be used as part of the normal mail address. All UK mail sorting processes are automated and set to only read BFPO numbers; any alteration to the standard address may cause the mail item to be delayed.</p>

<h2 id="look-up-bfpo-numbers">Look up BFPO numbers</h2>

<p>BFPO numbers are seperated into two areas, the first are issued for HM Ships with the second being issued for all other locations.</p>

<h3 id="static-bfpo-numbers">Static BFPO numbers</h3>
<p>These are used for a given location, and/or group of isolated detachments, and will not move.</p>

<h3 id="hm-ships">HM ships</h3>
<p>These BFPO numbers refer to a specific ship or Naval Party, regardless of their location around the world, although some may refer to land-based naval establishments.</p>

<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>

<h2 id="e-bluey-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it">E-bluey: what it is and how to use it</h2>

<p>When British Forces are deployed on operations they are entitled to free aerogrammes (colloquially known as “blueys” because of their colour) to and from their families and friends. This service has been in place for a considerable time. Blueys as we know them today were issued for the first time during the early days of the Northern Ireland deployment. More recently BFPO, working in conjunction with SuperLetter.com, has pioneered an electronic form of the bluey known as ‘e-bluey’.</p>

<p>The e-bluey is a Hybrid mail system that allows service personnel, relatives and friends to maintain a personal and private contact with each other while serving on operations or exercise for more than 60 days duration. Probably the most important factor is that the system is two-way. This means those service personnel with access to the Internet can send e-blueys back home.  </p>

<h3 id="how-e-bluey-works">How e-bluey works</h3>

<p>You can either compose your message online or offline using a word processor or the Quick Letter Writer. This message is sent to the e-bluey server, where it is stored prior to being down-loaded by the Forces Post Office (FPO) in the appropriate operational theatre, or by BFPO Northolt and Denfence Mail Centres for e-blueys addressed to the UK.</p>

<p>It is then printed and sealed before being passed into the local FPO/Royal Mail mailstream. The system is private and personal as the text is only seen by the originator and the recipient, there are two stages of encryption to ensure that the message remains private and personal. The specialist machinery prints and seals it automatically without the e-bluey being seen by the operator. The service is free to the user, although the MOD pays a fee for each letter transmitted. The time of transmission of a letter to the adddressee can be dramatically reduced, as it is not necessary to physically transport the letter through the military mail system between theatres.</p>

<h3 id="who-can-use-e-bluey">Who can use e-bluey</h3>

<p>Service Personnel, Relatives and friends of service personnel who are deployed on operations are entitled to use the e-bluey service. Both the BFPO and e-bluey web-sites have a list of entitled BFPO locations that can be reached through the service. Revenue protection measures are implemented from time to time at the BFPO Headquarters in London and by the e-bluey administrator to ensure that the system is being used correctly.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-photo-to-your-e-bluey">Add a photo to your e-bluey</h3>

<p>Photo-bluey is a feature within e-bluey that allows you to insert a photo, either colour or black and white, at the top of an e-bluey. The photo to be inserted must be on your computer and can be any size. However the area available on an e-bluey to insert the photo is limited to 185mm wide x 115mm high (7.2 x 4.5 inchs or 700 x 434 pixels).</p>

<p>Photos smaller than this will be printed actual size, whilst photos larger will be automatically reduced proportionally to fit as closely to the 185mm x 115mm area. Please remember that the larger the photo the longer it will take to upload to the e-bluey server, so please be patient when you are uploading large photos.</p>

<h2 id="e-bluey-additional-services">E-bluey: additional services</h2>

<h3 id="fax-bluey">Fax-bluey</h3>

<p>Fax-bluey is basically the same as an e-bluey, however it allows the sender to send an e-bluey in your own handwriting instead of using a computer.</p>

<p>To use the fax-bluey service:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a fax-bluey from your Unit Post Orderly, FPO or Hive personnel  </li>
  <li>write your letter in the large box starting from the top of the form  </li>
  <li>write CLEARLY AND IN LARGE PRINT the name and address of the person you are writing to in the ‘to’ box at the bottom of the form  </li>
  <li>write your own name and address in the ‘from’ box  </li>
  <li>when you have completed your letter, take it to your nearest fax-scanner to be scanned in and sent to the e-bluey server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once loaded onto the server your letter then follows the same procedure as a normal e-bluey.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-fax2email">What is Fax2email?</h4>
<p>Fax2email is virtually the same as the Fax-bluey, except that in the ‘to’ box you must write CLEARLY AND IN LARGE PRINT the e-mail address of the person to whom you are writing.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-pay-bluey">What is pay-bluey?</h4>
<p>Pay-bluey works in the same format as e-bluey, it is a Hybrid mail system that allows service personnel, relatives and friends to maintain a personal and private contact with each other while serving overseas at British Forces Post Offices that are not covered by the Operational Welfare Package.</p>

<p>The main difference between each system is that e-bluey is free to use but, as it states in the name, you have to pay for the pay-bluey service. However, please remember you are only able to use the pay-bluey service to a location where an e-bluey system has been installed.</p>

</section><p>All potential users of the BFPO Commercial Mail system are strongly advised to read both the disclaimer and additional information.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>

<p>The Authority does not endorse any company that appears on the BFPO Commercial Contracts List, in any way whatsoever, including any product(s) or service(s) they offer.</p>

<p>Individuals who make use of these companies do so entirely at their own risk.</p>

<p>Individuals are to be aware that there may be other companies, not appearing on the BFPO Commercial Contracts List, who may be able to offer the same, or similar product(s) or service(s).</p>

<p>Should you choose to order from a company not appearing on the BFPO Commercial Contracts List, they will be required to adhere to one of the following processes;</p>

<p>Once a company has received an order from an Authorised Individual, they can despatch articles of Commercial Mail to End Customers at worldwide BFPO locations, via the HQ BFPO Northolt Commercial Mail (CM) System, by following one of the four following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Companies who foresee a potential ‘one off’, or infrequent use of the BFPO CM System can either;</li>
</ol>
<p>a. Physically post the article at a Post Office and pay the appropriate (HM Forces) postage rate (NOTE: using either Royal Mail Documentation (CN22/23) or ParcelForce Worldwide PFU 509 Despatch Pack). Payment for this method allows for both the shipment to HQ BFPO Northolt and the onward shipment to the BFPO End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct CM Contract with BFPO, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>b. Utilise the arrangement BFPO has with Parcelforce Worldwide*, named the ‘One Stop Shop’ Process. Under this process, Companies contract directly with ParcelForce Worldwide (see below for contact details), who, in turn,  are in direct CM Contract with BFPO. Payment for this method also allows for both the shipment to HQ BFPO Northolt and the onward shipment to the BFPO End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct CM Contract with BFPO, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<p>*NOTE: Many Companies are already in direct Contract with ParcelForce for collections of goods direct from their premises for addresses in the UK mainland only. This does not allow for the correct documentation or onward shipment (and extra cost) for despatch from HQ BFPO Northolt to the BFPO End Customer. We recommend that you speak to your Parcelforce Representative for further information.</p>

<p>OR 
c. Utilise any CM Contract BFPO may have with other Courier Companies who have chosen to be in direct CM Contract with BFPO (see ‘Related pages’ to the right, ‘BFPO Commercial Contracts’ List). Under this process, Companies contract directly with the Courier Company on the list who, in turn, is in direct CM Contract with BFPO. Payment for this method is made direct to the Courier Company, who are themselves invoiced by BFPO. This allows for both the shipment to HQ BFPO Northolt and the onward shipment to the BFPO End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct CM Contract with BFPO, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<ol>
<li>Companies who foresee potential frequent use of the BFPO CM System enter into a CM Contract directly with BFPO Commercial (see below for contact details), for the onward shipment by BFPO to the BFPO End Customer, with prior use of either your Company’s own transport or a carrier of your Company’s choice for the inland journey to deliver articles to HQ BFPO Northolt.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h3>

<p>All potential users of the HQ BFPO Commercial Mail System must read the rules on mail prohibitions and restrictions.</p>

<p>Adhere without exclusion to the weight and size restrictions that apply to Commercial Mail.</p>

<p>Note that articles outside of these maximum weight and size restrictions will be refused upon entry at the HQ BFPO Commercial Mail reception desk.</p>

<p>Note that Purchase Order numbers cannot be accommodated under the electronic Invoicing process that supports the automated BFPO Commercial Mail System and will therefore not appear on any invoice issued by the Defence Business Service, Liverpool</p>

<p>Note that HQ BFPO will not enter into any compensation arrangements with, or make any direct compensation payments to, any Third Party who use a company that is itself already in direct Commercial Mail Contract with BFPO to despatch their articles to HQ BFPO Northolt and beyond, to end BFPO addresses overseas. BFPO’s responsibility and authority remains within the Commercial Mail Contract with the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with HQ BFPO ONLY. Any arrangement between the Third Party and the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with BFPO, regarding the despatch of the Third Party’s articles to HQ BFPO Northolt and beyond, is entirely the concern of those two parties ONLY. HQ BFPO bears no responsibility, authority or commitment in that relationship, as its contractual relationship is with the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with HQ BFPO ONLY</p>

<p>Note that BFPO offers a very limited service for items destined for 5000 series BFPO numbers, one that does not offer any delivery guarantees or compensation coverage. This is due to the fact that once items have reached HQ BFPO for processing, they are then passed to a separate, 3rd party for subsequent processing and distribution, who operate very strict controls on mail volume allocations and types of items allowed. This places the items totally outside of BFPO’s control, therefore no assurance as to final delivery timeframes can be given and BFPO does not accept liability for compensation in the event of any item(s) going missing. Should the 3rd party, for whatever reason, refuse to accept any item upon presentation by HQ BFPO, then the Sender shall be notified by BFPO and be responsible for its collection from BFPO, or, BFPO will return the item back to the Sender, at the Sender’s cost (The 3rd party, responsible for onward processing and distribution, may be contacted on 01908 8522222 - Option 3).</p>
