</header><article id="register-with-cis"><header><h1>Part 1: Register with CIS</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re self-employed and working for a contractor in the construction industry, you should register as a subcontractor with the Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>). </p>

<p><abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> is administered by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). It regulates payments from contractors to subcontractors in the building industry.</p>

<h2>How to register</h2>

<p>To register as a subcontractor, call the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> helpline. You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>the name you want to register with (eg your name, business name)</li>
  <li>the unique taxpayer reference number (<abbr title="unique taxpayer reference number">UTR</abbr>) for your business </li>
  <li>a <a href="/national-insurance-number" title="get a National Insurance number">National Insurance Number</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you don’t have a <abbr title="unique taxpayer reference number">UTR</abbr>, <a href="/register-for-self-assessment" title="register for Self Assessment">register for Self Assessment</a> before you register with the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> helpline</strong><br>
0845 366 7899<br>
8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday<br>
8am to 4pm, Saturday</p>
</div>

<p>Your contractor will make <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> deductions from the payments they make to you. These count towards your tax and National Insurance payments when you fill in your Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered with the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>, you can apply for <a href="how-to-get-a-gross-payment-status" title="apply for gross payment status">gross payment status</a> if your business passes some tests. This is where you get your full payment without any deductions being made (you take care of these yourself).</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re based abroad but do construction work in the UK you still need to register with <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>, but the <a href="/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme/if-your-business-is-based-outside-the-uk" title="registration if you're based outside the UK">registration process</a> is different.</p>
</div>

<h2>If your business is a limited company</h2>

<p>If you’re a company subcontractor and you’ve had <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> deductions taken from your payments, you’ll need to complete a <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/payroll/year-end/annual-return.htm" title="P35 Employer Annual Return">P35 Employer Annual Return</a> - usually online.</p>

<p>You can use the P35 to reclaim deductions taken from the payments - there’s more information about this on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/sub/p35return.htm" title="HMRC website - P35 returns"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>


</article><article id="how-to-get-gross-payment-status"><header><h1>Part 2: How to get gross payment status</h1>
  </header><p>When you’ve registered with the Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>), you can apply for gross payment status if your business passes some tests.</p>

<p>This means your contractor pays your full payments. You take care of your own tax and National Insurance instead of having deductions made from your payments by your
contractor.</p>

<p>To qualify, you must show HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) that your business passes 3 tests.</p>

<h2>Business test</h2>

<p>You’ll need to show that your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>does construction work (or provides labour for it) in the UK</li>
  <li>is run through a bank account </li>
</ul>
<h2>Turnover test</h2>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will look at your turnover for the last 12 months. Ignoring <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and the cost of materials, your turnover must be at least:</p>

<ul>
<li>£30,000 if you’re a sole trader</li>
  <li>£30,000 for each partner in a partnership, or at least £200,000 for the whole partnership</li>
  <li>£30,000 for each director of a company, or at least £200,000 for the whole company</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your company’s controlled by 5 people or fewer, you must have an annual turnover of £30,000 for each of them.</p>
</div>

<h2>Compliance test</h2>

<p>You must have kept up to date with your tax and National Insurance in the past. You’re allowed a few lapses - full details are on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/subcontractors/advice-pay.htm#2" title="HMRC website"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Once you’re registered you must declare your payments in your Self Assessment tax return at the end of the tax year.  </p>

<p>Apply by calling the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> helpline:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong><abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> helpline</strong><br>
0845 366 7899 
8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday<br>
8am to 4pm, Saturday</p>
</div>

<h2>Keeping your gross payment status</h2>

<p>Make sure you’re not late with your Self Assessment tax returns and <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> payments - you could lose gross payment status otherwise.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> checks on this once a year with a review called a <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/subcontractors/gross-paid-review.htm" title="Tax Treatment Qualification Test (TTQT)">Tax Treatment Qualification Test (<abbr title="Tax Treatment Qualification Test">TTQT</abbr>).</a></p>

<p>If you fail the review, you’ll get a letter explaining why you’ve lost your status and how you can appeal. Usually you’ll have 90 days from the date of the letter.</p>


</article><article id="making-changes-to-your-business-status"><header><h1>Part 3: Making changes to your business status</h1>
  </header><p>Significant changes to your business can impact on your Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>) registration. If you have <a href="how-to-get-gross-payment-status" title="gross payment status">gross payment status</a>, you may need to apply again. </p>

<h2>Changes you must report</h2>

<p>Tell HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>change from a sole trader to a partnership</li>
  <li>become a sole trader after a partnership breaks up </li>
  <li>create a company</li>
  <li>add new shareholders</li>
  <li>stop trading  </li>
  <li>change your business, residential or registered address</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s detailed advice about changes you must report on the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/subcontractors/changes.htm" title="HMRC website" rel="external"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>
