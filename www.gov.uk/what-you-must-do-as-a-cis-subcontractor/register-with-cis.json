It regulates payments from contractors to subcontractors in the building industry.\r\n\r\n##How to register\r\n\r\nTo register as a subcontractor, call the CIS helpline. You'll need:\r\n\r\n- the name you want to register with (eg your name, business name)\r\n- the unique taxpayer reference number (UTR) for your business \r\n- a [National Insurance Number](/national-insurance-number \"get a National Insurance number\")\r\n\r\n^If you don't have a UTR, [register for Self Assessment](/register-for-self-assessment \"register for Self Assessment\") before you register with the CIS.^\r\n\r\n$C\r\n**CIS helpline**  \r\n0845 366 7899  \r\n8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday  \r\n8am to 4pm, Saturday\r\n$C\r\n\r\nYour contractor will make CIS deductions from the payments they make to you. These count towards your tax and National Insurance payments when you fill in your Self Assessment tax return.\r\n\r\nOnce you've registered with the CIS, you can apply for [gross payment status](how-to-get-a-gross-payment-status \"apply for gross payment status\") if your business passes some tests. This is where you get your full payment without any deductions being made (you take care of these yourself).\r\n\r\n^If you're based abroad but do construction work in the UK you still need to register with CIS, but the [registration process](/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme/if-your-business-is-based-outside-the-uk \"registration if you're based outside the UK\") is different.^\r\n\r\n##If your business is a limited company\r\n\r\nIf you're a company subcontractor and you've had CIS deductions taken from your payments, you'll need to complete a [P35 Employer Annual Return](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/payroll/year-end/annual-return.htm \"P35 Employer Annual Return\"){:rel=\"external\"} - usually online.\r\n\r\nYou can use the P35 to reclaim deductions taken from the payments - there's more information about this on the [HMRC website.](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cis/sub/p35return.htm \"HMRC website - P35 returns\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n  \r\n*[CIS]: Construction Industry Scheme \r\n*[UTR]: unique taxpayer reference number\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenue & Customs","slug":"register-with-cis","title":"Register with CIS"}},{"table":{"body":"When you've registered with the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), you can apply for gross payment status if your business passes some tests.\r\n\r\nThis means your contractor pays your full payments.
