<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide offers an overview of the standards of good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="standards of good agricultural and environmental condition">GAECs</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="standards of good agricultural and environmental condition">GAECs</abbr> form part of the requirements under Cross Compliance and apply to anyone who receives payments under Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and certain Rural Development schemes. These requirements apply in addition to underlying obligations under European and UK legislation. <abbr title="standards of good agricultural and environmental condition">GAECs</abbr> set requirements for farmers in respect of soils, as well as maintaining a range of habitat and landscape features which are characteristic of the English countryside. They either reinforce existing law, or were already existing good practice. In the UK, the devolved governments of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland each define <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards for their own region. This takes into account the diversity in landscape and farming practices throughout the UK.</p>

<p>The guide provides a complete list of the <abbr title="standards of good agricultural and environmental condition">GAECs</abbr> for England and links to other guides about specific <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-good-agricultural-and-environmental-conditions">What are good agricultural and environmental conditions?</h2>

<p>You have to keep your farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>) as part of Cross Compliance requirements - failure to meet <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards may result in a reduction to your payment. This applies to programmes such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/the-single-payment-scheme">see the guide on the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>other land-based direct-payment schemes</li>
  <li>Environmental Stewardship - see the guide on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-stewardship">Environmental Stewardship: the basics</a>
</li>
  <li>the Rural Development Programme for England (<abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, the <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards aim to ensure that farmers protect the three main elements of the farmed environment. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>soil and water </li>
  <li>habitats and wildlife </li>
  <li>landscape features </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of the Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) Health Check, the Energy Crops Scheme, Protein Crop Premium and Area Payment for Nuts scheme will end in 2012. Funding from these schemes will transfer into the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="good-agricultural-and-environmental-conditions-and-cross-compliance">Good agricultural and environmental conditions and Cross Compliance</h2>

<p>As a claimant of Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) or certain Rural Development Programme in England (<abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr>) subsidies, you need to meet standards of good agricultural and environmental conditions (<abbr title="standards of good agricultural and environmental condition">GAECs</abbr>) as part of your Cross Compliance requirements to protect:</p>

<ul>
<li>soil and water</li>
  <li>habitats and wildlife</li>
  <li>landscape features</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of cross compliance requirements are part of existing law that all farmers must meet, even if they are not claiming subsidy.</p>

<p>The Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>), the Environment Agency (EA), Animal Health (AH) and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) inspect farms which receive <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> funding and other direct payments to ensure they are meeting cross compliance requirements.</p>

<p>If you do not meet <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may reduce your payments; the percentage reduction will depend on factors such as the severity and extent of the breach. You may also face legal penalties where the cross compliance requirement is also part of domestic law.</p>

<p><abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards provide a baseline of environmental protection for soil and water, habitats and landscape features. If your compliance requirements under the <abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr> schemes - such as Environmental Stewardship - conflict with <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> measures, then the <abbr title="Rural Development Programme for England">RDPE</abbr> scheme requirements will take priority.</p>

<p>If you want information on possible exemptions to any <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> cross compliance requirement, you can call the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Customer Service Centre on 0845 603 7777 or email them at <a href="mailto:csc@rpa.gsi.gov.uk">csc@rpa.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>For guidance on complying with cross compliance standards, you can contact the Cross Compliance Helpline on 0845 345 1302.</p>

<h2 id="good-agricultural-and-environmental-condition-standards-for-soil-and-water-management">Good agricultural and environmental condition standards for soil and water management</h2>

<p>The good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>) standard for soil management is <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 1 - Soil Protection Review (<abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr>).</p>

<p>For more information on the <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards, see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/avoiding-air-water-and-soil-pollution-on-farms">air, water and soil pollution: the basics</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/soil-management-standards-for-farmers">soil use</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://secure.services.defra.gov.uk/wps/portal/wfa/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gzdx8LQyd_A0t3X3dHA08fM1fvAEdXYwNTI6B8JG55AzMCusNB9uFW4W6OXx5kPkjeAAdwNND388jPTdUvyI0wyAxIVwQAzhGtrA!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/">complete and submit your <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> online.</a>.</p>

<p>There are two <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards relating to water management:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 14 - Protection of hedgerows and watercourses</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 18 - Water abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/UIMenu/CC81AD645B12CE67802573B000506186?Opendocument">access <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards on the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> Health Check requires the Government to implement a new standard on buffer strips next to watercourses by 2012, in order to tackle the issue of water pollution. Following the public consultation in Spring 2009, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> decided to pursue a voluntary approach rather than a regulatory approach from 2010.</p>

<p>Farmers will be encouraged to put in place buffer strips of 6 meters or wider to protect watercourses in vulnerable locations. These voluntary buffers will be in addition to the current requirements under <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 14 and the new requirement on no-spread zones to be introduced in 2012. Advice and guidance on locating and managing buffer strips is available to farmers through Catchment Sensitive Farming Officers, Natural England Advisers, Campaign for the Farmed Environment and other farm advisers. Payments for buffer strips are also available through Entry Level Stewardship.</p>

<p>In 2012, a new <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standard will be introduced extending the current Nitrate Vulnerable Zone no-spread zones next to watercourses to all land claimed under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The use of non-organic fertiliser and pesticide will not be allowed within two metres of the surface of a watercourse, and non-organic manure will not be allowed within ten metres of a watercourse (and within 50 metres of boreholes, springs and wells), on all farms claiming under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> and/or in certain land-based Rural Development Programme in England schemes.</p>

<p>Exemptions will apply to allow fertilisation of land near watercourses for the purposes of breeding wader birds or as a species-rich semi-natural grassland. As already required in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, farmers will have to mark and retain a map showing all no-spread zones in order to show compliance.</p>

<h2 id="good-agricultural-and-environmental-conditions-for-habitats-and-wildlife">Good agricultural and environmental conditions for habitats and wildlife</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="standards of good agricultural and environmental condition">GAECs</abbr> provide a baseline of environmental protection for habitats and wildlife, in order to maintain biodiversity and sustainable farming.</p>

<p>The current <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards for habitats and wildlife are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 5 - Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-impact-assessments">Environmental Impact Assessments</a>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 9 - Overgrazing and unsuitable supplementary feeding - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/grazing-and-pasture-sustainable-management-schemes">grazing and pasture</a>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 10 - Heather and grass burning - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/heather-and-grass-burning">heather and grass burning</a>

<h3 id="permanent-pasture">Permanent pasture</h3>

<p>Permanent pasture has been defined as land that has been under grass for at least five years and has not been ploughed for other crops in that time. It includes all herbaceous plants traditionally found in natural pasture or normally included in mixtures of seeds for pasture or meadows in England, regardless of whether or not used for grazing.</p>

<p>Under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation, each Member State is required to ensure that the national level of permanent pasture is maintained at the same level in comparison with the total area of agricultural land. Afforestation of permanent pasture that is “compatible with the environment” is exempt from this requirement providing it has been assessed under the existing Forestry EIA Regulations.</p>

<p>If the area of permanent pasture in England declines in comparison to the baseline 2003 figures, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> may have to take steps to prevent any further loss of permanent pasture, especially if this decline approaches 5 per cent. If the area of permanent pasture declines by more than 10 per cent, farmers who converted pasture in the two years prior to the 10 per cent level being exceeded will be obliged to reconvert an area of land to permanent pasture and retain the land as permanent pasture for five years. In such circumstances areas converted to woodland would not be required to be converted back to permanent pasture. It is good practice to leave land in permanent pasture on steep fields and flood plains, as this can contribute to reducing erosion and soil loss during periods of heavy rain and flooding.</p>

<p>Payments are available under Environmental Stewardship for managing permanent pasture when farmers meet specific stocking, fertiliser and grassland management conditions, providing they have delivered the agreed environmental outcomes.

<h3 id="recapturing-the-environmental-benefits-of-set-aside">Recapturing the environmental benefits of set-aside</h3>

<p>Following the <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> Health Check, farmers are no longer required to set aside a portion of their land. However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) recognises that set-aside has delivered some important environmental benefits so is encouraging farmers to pursue a voluntary approach, The Campaign for the Farmed Environment. The CFE is an industry-led initiative involving several organisations, including the National Farmers Union, the County Land &amp; Business Association, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, as well as Government partners such as <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and Natural England. The campaign was launched on the 5 November 2009 and promotes activities by farmers and land managers which secure a national geographical spread of the following environmental benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>farmland birds (to address the three key requirements of wild birds, namely over-wintering feeding habitat, spring/summer breeding sites and spring feeding opportunities)</li>
  <li>resource protection (to address soil conservation and water protection by locating uncropped areas, buffer strips and/or adopting agronomic practices which minimise the risk of soil erosion and diffuse pollution to water)</li>
  <li>biodiversity provision (to retain/create areas of uncropped or open habitat that diversify the arable landscape and provide opportunities for open ground species, and feeding and breeding sites often for more common species)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although farmers are not formally required to help recapture the environmental benefits of set-aside, the campaign encourages farmers to participate by undertaking measures within or outside Environmental Stewardship. The CFE will be monitored annually to assess its success. If it does not deliver the environmental benefits needed, there may be a need to introduce regulation.</p>

<h2 id="good-agricultural-and-environmental-conditions-for-landscape-features">Good agricultural and environmental conditions for landscape features</h2>

<p>There are good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>) standards designed to provide a baseline for environmental protection of landscape features, in order to maintain bio-diversity, public rights of way and amenities, and historic aspects of the landscape.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standards for landscape features cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 6 - Sites of Special Scientific Interest</li>

<h2 id="advisory-buffer-strips-next-to-watercourses">Advisory buffer strips next to watercourses</h2>

<p>Some day-to-day farming activities, if not done carefully, can damage the quality of water in ponds, lakes, rivers, streams or ditches on or near your land. Careful management can help prevent sediment, nutrients, bacteria, pesticides and other pollutants from reaching the water, which can reduce water quality and be harmful to aquatic life. One fairly simple way of protecting water from potentially harmful farming activities is creating a network of grass strips along riverbanks, streams, and ditches (known as riparian buffer strips). This will provide a buffer between agricultural operations and water.</p>

<p>Riparian buffers are areas of vegetation (usually grass) next to watercourses which provide a physical barrier that:</p>

<ul>
<li>slows surface water runoff and so encourages silt to be deposited, which helps reduce the amount of sediment and soil bound pollutants entering watercourses</li>
  <li>helps the soil to absorb surface water runoff and dissolved pollutants before these can reach watercourses</li>
</ul>
<p>Dense vegetation such as thick grass makes buffer strips more effective at controlling sediment and water runoff.</p>

<p>Increasing the quality of freshwater is a key aim of the Water Framework Directive and reducing pollution from agricultural activities will be important in meeting these targets. Following the public consultation in Spring 2009, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) decided to pursue advisory targeting of buffer strips alongside watercourses rather than a regulatory approach. This is in addition to the existing requirements under <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> 14, and the requirements for no-spread zones due to be introduced under a new <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr> standard in 2012. The take up of buffer strips under this voluntary approach will be monitored to ensure that the voluntary approach is providing adequate protection of water resources from agricultural pollution.</p>

<p>Under this voluntary approach, farmers subject to Cross Compliance are provided with guidance on locating uncultivated buffer strips in sites where they will be most effective at reducing water pollution. Payments for buffer strips are also available under the Entry Level Stewardship.</p>

<p>Further advice and guidance on locating buffers where they will be most effective, along with management advice, is available from the following sources amongst others:</p>

<li>Catchment Sensitive Farming Officers</li>
  <li>Natural England Advisers</li>
