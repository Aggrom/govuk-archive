  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>For all employees earning more than £7,606 a year you have to deduct Class 1 National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance Contributions">NICs</abbr>) from their pay. You also pay a direct contribution yourself. The exact amounts depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much an employee earns</li>
  <li>their National Insurance category (this depends on their circumstances)</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to keep National Insurance records for all employees earning more than £5,564.</p>

<h2>National Insurance on benefits</h2>
<p>If you provide any <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits" title="employee benefits">employee benefits</a> (eg health insurance, company cars) you might have to deduct Class 1A National Insurance contributions from these. <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-a-to-z" title="Expenses and benefits A to Z">This depends on the benefit</a>.</p>

<p>Some small or irregular benefits can be brought together in a single annual payment called a <a href="/paye-settlement-agreements" title="PAYE Settlement Agreements"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement</a>. You’ll have to pay Class 1B National Insurance on these.</p>

<h2>Workers not on your payroll</h2>

<p>Anyone who does work for you but is not on your payroll (eg self employed, volunteers), is responsible for paying their own National Insurance contributions.</p>


</article><article id="calculating-and-paying-national-insurance-contributions"><header><h1>Part 2: Calculating and paying National Insurance contributions</h1>
  </header><h2>Calculating National Insurance Contributions</h2>
<p>You calculate your employees’ National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance Contributions">NICs</abbr>) using your Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) payroll system. </p>

<p>You’ll need each employee’s <a href="/national-insurance-contributions-nics-for-employers/national-insurance-category-letters" title="National Insurance category">National Insurance category</a> for this.</p>

<p>If you do your payroll manually and don’t use software, the <a rel="external" href="http://nicecalculator.hmrc.gov.uk/Class1NICs1.aspx" title="HMRC National Insurance calculator"><abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Insurance calculator</a> will help you calculate the amounts you need to enter into your payroll. </p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> also has information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/payroll/index.htm" title="payroll and NICs calculations">payroll and <abbr title="National Insurance Contributions">NICs</abbr> calculations.</a></p>

<h2>Making payments</h2>
<p>Most employers pay Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance Contributions">NICs</abbr> by direct debit, which you set up when you register as an employer with <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to pay by direct debit there are other ways of <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payinghmrc/paye.htm" title="paying Class 1">paying Class 1</a>. </p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> also has information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payinghmrc/class1anics.htm" title="paying Class 1A">paying Class 1A.</a> and on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payinghmrc/psa.htm" title="paying class 1B">paying Class 1B.</a> </p>


</article><article id="deadlines-for-nics-payments"><header><h1>Part 3: Deadlines for NICs payments</h1>
  </header><p>National Insurance Contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) Class 1 are part of your monthly Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) payments.</p>

<p>Class 1A contributions on expenses and benefits are calculated separately at the end of the year. These have to be in HM Revenues &amp; Customs’ (<abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) account by 22 July if you pay electronically or by 19 July if you send a cheque. </p>

<p>If you pay Class 1B on employee benefits your payments have to be in <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s account by 22 October (19 October if you pay by cheque). </p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> has detailed information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/file-or-pay/payments/deadlines.htm#2" title="national insurance payment deadlines">National Insurance payment deadlines.</a></p>


</article><article id="national-insurance-category-letters"><header><h1>Part 4: National Insurance category letters</h1>
  </header><p>You need to know an employee’s National Insurance category to work out how much to pay for them. If you use Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) payroll software it’ll ask you for the category letter to calculate your contributions.</p>

<p>An employee’s <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> category letter depends on whether they have a separate (contracted-out) pension scheme and opted out of paying into the State Pension.</p>
