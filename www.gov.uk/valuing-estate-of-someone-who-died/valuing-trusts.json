These will have &lsquo;im&rsquo; or &lsquo;ik&rsquo; next to the price. </p>\n\n<p>You need to work out the value from the date the last payment was made until the date of death. This can be complicated - ask a professional valuer to help.</p>\n\n<h2>Unit trusts</h2>\n\n<p>Newspapers don&rsquo;t show the value of these so you need to ask the fund manager. If you&rsquo;re given 2 prices, use the lower one.</p>\n\n<h2>Government stocks and bonds</h2>\n\n<p>If the deceased person held these, contact Computershare at the UK Debt Management Office to get a valuation:</p>\n\n<div class=\"address\"><div class=\"adr org fn\"><p>\n\n\n<br />Computershare Investor Services PLC  \n<br />PO Box 2411  \n<br />The Pavilions  \n<br />Bridgwater Road  \n<br />Bristol BS99 6WX  \n<br />\n<br />\n</p></div></div>\n\n<h2>Shares in ISAs</h2>\n\n<p>If the person had shares in an <abbr title=\"Individual Savings Account\">ISA</abbr> (Individual Savings account), ask the fund manager for a valuation. Contact details should be on the deceased person&rsquo;s paperwork. Use the closing price on the day the person died.</p>\n\n<p>The same applies to <abbr title=\"Personal Equity Plans\">PEPs</abbr> (Personal Equity Plans) and <abbr title=\"Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts\">TESSAs</abbr> (Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts).</p>\n\n<h2>If the stock exchange was closed when the person died</h2>\n\n<p>You can use the closing price on either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the last day the stock exchange was open before the person died</li>\n  <li>the first day the stock exchange was open after they died</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So if the person died on Sunday, and the closing price was lower on Monday than on the previous Friday, you can use Monday&rsquo;s price. </p>\n\n<h2>Unlisted stocks and shares</h2>\n\n<p>Unlisted shares are shares in a private company that are not listed on a stock exchange. Find out the market value of these shares by contacting the company secretary or accountant.</p>\n\n<h2>If you make a mistake</h2>\n\n<p>If you under-value stocks and shares, contact the Probate and Inheritance Tax Helpline:</p>\n\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<p><strong>Probate and Inheritance Tax Helpline</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>0845 302 0900</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you sell shares within a year of the date of death for less than the value you paid Inheritance Tax on, you can claim relief for the loss using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?formid=3369&amp;record=W99HM9MqzP8\" title=\"form IHT35 on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) website\">form IHT35 on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr>) website.</a></p>\n\n"}},{"part":{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/valuing-debts-and-liabilities","slug":"valuing-debts-and-liabilities","order":7,"title":"Debts and liabilities","body":"<p>When you value someone&rsquo;s estate you deduct their debts from the total value. </p>\n\n<p>This includes anything they owed when they died as well as &lsquo;liabilities&rsquo;, which are things they&rsquo;re responsible for paying, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>household bills</li>\n  <li>bills for goods and services they had received but not yet paid for (eg building work, decorators, solicitors, accountants)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to look through their paperwork for things like bills and statements. You might also need to contact energy suppliers or the local council to find out if they owed money.</p>\n\n<h2>Mortgages and joint property</h2>\n\n<p>If the person had a mortgage or secured loan on a property, deduct this from the property&rsquo;s value. If it&rsquo;s more than the property is worth, deduct the excess amount from the rest of the estate. </p>\n\n<p>If the person had a joint mortgage with someone else, just deduct their share of the mortgage.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If there\u2019s any payout from a mortgage protection policy, you need to add this to the value of the estate.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Loans and credit card debts</h2>\n\n<p>You need to deduct the following from the estate:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>loans</li>\n  <li>outstanding credit card balances</li>\n  <li>overdrafts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If there\u2019s a payout from a payment protection plan, you need to add this to the value of the estate.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Uncashed cheques</h2>\n\n<p>If the person wrote cheques that haven&rsquo;t been cashed yet you can deduct these from the value of the estate if they are for things the person bought before they died. </p>\n\n<p>If they&rsquo;d written the cheque as a gift, you can&rsquo;t deduct the amount of the cheque, but you don&rsquo;t add it to the estate either - you just ignore it.</p>\n\n<h2>Debts owed to close friends or family</h2>\n\n<p>You can only deduct these if they&rsquo;re legally enforceable. This is when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the deceased person and the lender made a written or verbal agreement about repaying the loan</li>\n  <li>there&rsquo;s evidence that the person was making repayments</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Rules in Scotland are different - you could use a statement from someone else to show that a debt is legally enforceable.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Gambling debts</h2>\n\n<p>Most gambling debts aren&rsquo;t deducted because they&rsquo;re not legally enforceable. You can only deduct them if they&rsquo;re placed through a &lsquo;totaliser&rsquo; run by the Racecourse and Betting Control Board.</p>\n\n<h2>Guarantee debts</h2>\n\n<p>These are promises to pay someone else&rsquo;s debt if they can&rsquo;t pay it themselves. If the loan hadn&rsquo;t been repaid when the person died, you may be able to make a deduction from the estate. This depends on the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances - if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have no financial resources, you can deduct the whole amount of the loan</li>\n  <li>can repay part of the loan, you can deduct the amount they can&rsquo;t repay</li>\n  <li>can repay the whole loan, you can&rsquo;t deduct anything</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Funeral expenses</h2>\n\n<p>You can deduct these from the value of the estate, as well as expenses to cover things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>flowers</li>\n  <li>refreshments for mourners</li>\n  <li>expenses paid by the executor or administrator when arranging the funeral</li>\n  <li>a headstone to mark the grave</li>\n</ul>\n\n"}},{"part":{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/an-example","slug":"an-example","order":8,"title":"An example","body":"<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how to value an estate for Inheritance Tax purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Robert died on 10 April 2011, leaving \u00a31,000 to charity (exempt from Inheritance Tax) and the rest of his estate to his daughter. </p>\n\n<p>The value of his assets are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>house = \u00a3300,000</li>\n  <li>car = \u00a37,500</li>\n  <li>household goods = \u00a32,000</li>\n  <li>bank account = \u00a319,000</li>\n  <li>shares = \u00a330,000</li>\n  <li>Premium Bonds = \u00a3500</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Total value = \u00a3359,000</p>\n\n<p>The value of his debts are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>telephone bill = \u00a355</li>\n  <li>electricity bill = \u00a345</li>\n  <li>gas bill = \u00a335</li>\n  <li>funeral expenses = \u00a3865</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Total debts to deduct = \u00a31000</p>\n\n<p>The net value of Robert&rsquo;s estate minus the charity donation of \u00a31,000 is \u00a3357,000.</p>\n\n<p>You can now work out the amount of Inheritance Tax to pay:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>The Inheritance Tax threshold is \u00a3325,000, so you take this away from the value of the estate.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This leaves \u00a332,000 that\u2019s taxable at 40%.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\u00a332,000 x 40% = \u00a312,800.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The amount of Inheritance Tax payable is \u00a312,800.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are instructions on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payinghmrc/inheritance.htm\" title=\"how to pay Inheritance Tax\">how to pay Inheritance Tax</a> on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr>) website.</p>\n\n<div class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Interest is charged on any tax not paid within 6 months of the person\u2019s death - the <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/iht-interest-rates.htm\" title=\"interest rates\" rel=\"external\">interest rates</a> are on the <abbr title=\"HM Revenue &amp; Customs\">HMRC</abbr> website.</p>\n</div>\n\n"}}]}
