  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="types-of-discrimination"><header><h1>Part 1: Types of discrimination</h1>
  </header><p>It is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>age</li>
  <li>being or becoming a transsexual person</li>
  <li>being married or in a civil partnership</li>
  <li>being <a href="/working-when-pregnant-your-rights" title="Working when pregnant: your rights">pregnant</a> or having a child</li>
  <li><a href="/definition-of-disability-under-the-equality-act-2010" title="Definition of disability">disability</a></li>
  <li>race including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin</li>
  <li>religion, belief or lack of religion/belief</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
</ul>
<p>These are called ‘protected characteristics’.</p>

<p>You’re protected from discrimination in these situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>at work</li>
  <li>in education</li>
  <li>as a consumer</li>
  <li>when using public services</li>
  <li>when buying or renting property </li>
  <li>as a member or guest of a private club or association </li>
</ul>
<p>You are legally protected from discrimination by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" title="Equality Act 2010">Equality Act 2010.</a></p>

<p>You’re also protected from discrimination if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re associated with someone who has a protected characteristic, eg a family member or friend</li>
  <li>you’ve complained about discrimination or supported someone else’s claim</li>
</ul>
<h2>Action against discrimination</h2>

<p>You can do something voluntarily to help people with a protected characteristic. This is called ‘positive action’.</p>

<p>Taking positive action is legal if people with a protected characteristic:</p>

<ul>
<li>are at a disadvantage</li>
  <li>have particular needs</li>
  <li>are under-represented in an activity or type of work</li>
</ul></article><article id="how-you-can-be-discriminated-against"><header><h1>Part 2: How you can be discriminated against</h1>
  </header><p>Discrimination can come in one of the following forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>direct discrimination - treating someone with a protected characteristic less favourably than others</li>
  <li>indirect discrimination - putting rules or arrangements in place that apply to everyone, but that put someone with a protected characteristic at an unfair disadvantage</li>
  <li>harassment - unwanted behaviour linked to a protected characteristic that violates someone’s dignity or creates an offensive environment for them</li>
  <li>victimisation - treating someone unfairly because they’ve complained about discrimination or harassment</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It can be lawful to have specific rules or arrangements in place, as long as they can be justified.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="discrimination-at-work"><header><h1>Part 3: Discrimination at work</h1>
  </header><p>The law protects you against discrimination at work, including:</p>

<ul>

  <li>employment terms and conditions</li>
  <li>pay and benefits</li>
  <li>promotion and transfer opportunities</li>
  <li>training</li>
  <li>recruitment</li>
  <li>redundancy</li>
</ul>
<p>Some forms of discrimination are only allowed if they’re needed for the way the organisation works, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Roman Catholic school restricting applications for admission of pupils to Catholics only</li>
  <li>employing only women in a health centre for Muslim women</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disability</h2>

<p>If you’re disabled you have the same rights as other workers. Employers should also make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to help disabled employees and job-applicants with:</p>

<ul>
<li>application forms (eg providing forms in Braille, audio formats)</li>
  <li>aptitude tests (eg giving extra time to complete the tests)</li>
  <li>dismissal or redundancy</li>
  <li>discipline and grievances</li>
  <li>interview arrangements (eg wheelchair access, communicator support)</li>
  <li>making sure the workplace has the right facilities and equipment for disabled workers or someone offered a job</li>
  <li>promotion, transfer and training opportunities</li>
  <li>terms of employment, including pay</li>
  <li>work-related benefits like access to recreation or refreshment facilities</li>
</ul>
