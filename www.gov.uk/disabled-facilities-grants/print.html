  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re disabled and need to make changes to your home, you could get a grant from your local council to help with the costs. </p>

<p>The changes can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>widening doors and installing ramps</li>
  <li>improving access to rooms and facilities - eg by installing a stairlift or a downstairs bathroom</li>
  <li>providing a heating system suitable for your needs</li>
  <li>adapting heating or lighting controls to make them easier to use</li>
</ul>
<h2>Children under 19</h2>

<p>If you’re applying for a disabled child under 19, the grant is worked out differently. <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="contact your local council">Contact your local council</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">

</div>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The amount you get depends on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>what changes are needed to your home</li>
  <li>your weekly income</li>
  <li>your outgoings - eg rent or mortgage payments</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum amount of grant that you can get is:</p>

<ul>
<li>£30,000 if you live in England</li>
  <li>£36,000 if you live in Wales</li>
</ul>
<p>If you live in Scotland, <a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/localg/usefullinks/Q/editmode/on/forceupdate/on" title="contact your local council">contact your local council</a> to find out what grants are available.</p>

<p>Depending on your income, you may need to pay towards the cost of the work to the property.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You might not get any grant if you start work on your property before the council approves your application.</p>
</div>

<h2>How you’ll be paid</h2>

<p>You’ll be paid either:</p>

<ul>
<li>by instalments - as the work progresses </li>
  <li>in full - when the work is finished</li>
</ul>
<p>The council may pay the contractor directly, or give you a cheque to pass on - they’ll agree this with you when they approve your application.</p>

<h2>When you’ll be paid</h2>

<p>You’ll be paid either:</p>

<ul>
<li>when the council is happy with the finished work </li>
  <li>when you give the council the invoice, demand or receipt for payment from the contractor</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you do the work yourself or ask a relative to do it, the council will only accept invoices for materials or services you’ve bought.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply for the grant if you or someone living in your property is disabled. Either you or the person you’re applying for must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be the owner of the property or a tenant </li>
  <li>intend to occupy the property as a main or only home during the grant period (which is currently 5 years)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also apply for a grant if you’re a landlord and have a disabled tenant.</p>

<p>The council needs to be happy that the work is:</p>

<ul>
<li>necessary and appropriate to meet the disabled person’s needs</li>
  <li>reasonable and can be done - depending on the age and condition of the property</li>
</ul></article><article id="how-to-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: How to claim</h1>
  </header><p>Contact the housing or environment health department of your <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="local council">local council</a> and ask them to send you an application form. </p>

<h2>Before you apply</h2>

<p>You’ll need to find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>what changes are needed to your property</li>
  <li>the type of work that needs to be done</li>
  <li>the cost of the work</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>An occupational therapist can look at your circumstances and recommend the type of changes needed.</p>
</div>

<p>You should return your completed application to your local council before work starts on the property. </p>

<p>The council will normally need 2 written estimates for the work. They may be able to give you a list of builders or advise you about employing one.</p>

<p>They must tell you the result of your application in writing within 6 months of the application date. </p>


</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re refused a Disabled Facilities Grant, or are unhappy with the amount you’ve been awarded, you can appeal against the decision. Ask <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="your local council">your local council</a> for their appeals and complaints procedure.</p>
