  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="about-workplace-pensions"><header><h1>Part 1: About workplace pensions</h1>
  </header><p>A workplace pension is a way of saving for your retirement that’s arranged by your employer. </p>

<p>Some workplace pensions are called ‘occupational’, ‘works’, ‘company’ or ‘work-based’ pensions.</p>

<h2>How they work</h2>

<p>A percentage of your pay is put into the pension scheme automatically every payday.</p>

<p>In most cases, your employer and the government also add money into the pension scheme for you.</p>

<p>The money is used to pay you an income for the rest of your life when you start getting the pension.</p>

<p>You can usually take some of your workplace pension as a tax-free lump sum when you retire. </p>

<p>If the amount of money you’ve saved is quite small, you may be able to take it all as a lump sum - but if you pay Income Tax, you’ll have to pay tax on the lump sum.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t usually take the money out before you’re 55 at the earliest (unless you’re terminally ill).</p>
</div>

<h2>Workplace pensions and the State Pension</h2>

<p>Today the maximum basic State Pension you can get is £107.45 per week for a single person. </p>

<p>The money you get from a workplace or other pension could make it much easier for you financially when you’re retired.</p>

<h2>‘Automatic enrolment’</h2>

<p>A new law means that every employer must automatically enrol workers into a workplace pension scheme if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>are aged between 22 and State Pension age</li>
  <li>earn more than £8,105 a year</li>
  <li>work in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called ‘automatic enrolment’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check if the new law applies to you and when you may be <a href="/auto-enrolled-into-workplace-pension" title="Will I be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension?">enrolled into your employer’s scheme</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re already in a workplace pension scheme, you may not see any changes. Your workplace pension scheme will usually carry on as normal. </p>

<p>But if your employer doesn’t make a contribution to your pension now, they will have to by law when they ‘automatically enrol’ every worker.</p>

</article><article id="types-of-workplace-pensions"><header><h1>Part 2: Types of workplace pensions</h1>
  </header><p>There are 2 main types of workplace pension. Your employer decides which type of scheme you are offered.</p>

<h2>Defined contribution pension schemes</h2>

<p>These are also known as ‘money purchase’ schemes.</p>

<p>The money is invested by a pension provider chosen by your employer. The amount you get when you retire usually depends on: </p>

<ul>
<li>how much has been paid in</li>
  <li>how long you’ve been paying in</li>
  <li>how well the investment has done</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The value can go up or down in the short term. But pensions usually grow more than savings accounts over the long term.</p>
</div>

<p>Some schemes gradually move your money into lower-risk investments as you get nearer to retirement age. </p>

<p>If this doesn’t happen automatically, you may be able to ask for this to happen - ask your pension provider for more details.</p>

<p>The pension provider usually takes a small percentage of your pension pot as a management fee. Check the documents your employer gives you, or ask them, if you want to know how much this will be.</p>

<h2>Defined benefit pension schemes</h2>

<p>These are also known as ‘final salary’ or ‘salary-related’ pensions. They promise to give you a certain amount each year when you retire. This amount is fixed - it doesn’t depend on investments. </p>

<p>The amount you’ll get depends on your salary and on how long you’ve worked for your employer. The pension scheme administrator can give you more details.</p>

</article><article id="what-you-your-employer-and-the-government-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What you, your employer and the government pay</h1>
  </header><p>If you pay Income Tax, the government will add money to your workplace pension in the form of <a href="/income-tax-reliefs/pension-contributions-tax-relief" title="Pension contributions - tax relief">tax relief.</a></p>

<p>Many employers also add money too. A new law means that employers must pay in to eligible workers’ pension schemes. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Check if the new law applies to you and when you may be <a href="/auto-enrolled-into-workplace-pension" title="Will I be automatically enrolled into a workplace pension?">enrolled into your employer’s scheme.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Who pays what</h2>

<p>The amount you and your employer pay in varies according to what type of workplace pension scheme you’re in. </p>

<h2>You’ve been automatically enrolled in a workplace pension</h2>

<p>The law says a minimum percentage of your ‘qualifying earnings’ must be paid into your workplace pension scheme. </p>

<p>‘Qualifying earnings’ are either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the amount you earn before tax between £5,564 and £42,475 a year</li>
  <li>your entire salary or wages before tax</li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer chooses how to work out your qualifying earnings.</p>

<p>You and your employer can pay in more than the legal minimum. You can pay in less - as long as your employer’s contribution means at least the minimum has been paid.</p>

<p>If your employer offers you a <a href="/workplace-pensions/types-of-workplace-pensions" title="types of workplace pensions">defined contribution scheme,</a> the minimum amounts can go up in October 2017 and October 2018.</p>

<p>Most <a href="/workplace-pensions/types-of-workplace-pensions" title="types of workplace pensions">defined benefit schemes</a> pay above the minimum.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>The minimum you pay</th>
      <th>The minimum your employer pays</th>
      <th>The government pays</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>0.8% of your ‘qualifying earnings’ rising to 4% by 2018</td>
      <td>1% of your ‘qualifying earnings’ rising to 3% by 2018</td>
      <td>0.2% of your ‘qualifying earnings’ rising to 1% by 2018</td>

</div>

<h2>How contributions work</h2>

<p>Your pension pot builds up each payday with your employer’s contributions and tax relief. This is how it works if you’re in a defined contribution pension scheme.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/static/workplace_pensions_pots.jpg" width="320" height="260" alt="John puts in £40, his employer puts in £30, the government adds £10 tax relief"></p>

<h2>Not yet automatically enrolled into a workplace pension</h2>

<p>Your employer decides the minimum and maximum amounts you and they can pay in. If you pay Income Tax, the government automatically adds <a href="/income-tax-reliefs/pension-contributions-tax-relief" title="pension contributions tax relief">‘tax relief’</a> to your contribution.</p>

<h2>The effect on your tax credits or student loan repayments</h2>

<p>Joining a workplace pension scheme means that your take-home income will be reduced. But this may:</p>

<ul>
<li>mean you’re entitled to tax credits or increase the amount of tax credits you get</li>
  <li>reduce the amount of student loan repayments you need to make</li>
</ul></article><article id="protection-for-your-pension"><header><h1>Part 4: Protection for your pension</h1>
  </header><p>The money in every pension scheme is protected - how your pension is protected depends on the <a href="/workplace-pensions/types-of-workplace-pensions" title="types of pensions">type of scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>Defined contribution pension schemes</h2>

<h3>Your employer goes bust</h3>

<p>Defined contribution schemes are usually run by pension providers, not employers. If your employer goes bust, you won’t lose your pension pot.  </p>

<h3>Your pension provider goes bust</h3>

<p>If the pension provider was authorised by the Financial Services Authority and can’t pay, you can get compensation from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fscs.org.uk/" title="Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)">Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).</a></p>

<h3>Trust-based schemes</h3>

<p>Some defined contribution schemes are run by a trust appointed by the employer. These are called ‘trust-based schemes’. </p>

<p>If your employer goes out of business, you’ll still get your pension. But you might not get as much because the scheme’s running costs will be paid by members’ pension pots instead of the employer.</p>

<h2>Defined benefit pension schemes</h2>

<p>Your employer is responsible for making sure there’s enough money in the pension fund to pay each member the promised amount.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your employer is in financial trouble, they can’t touch the money in your pension.</p>
</div>

<p>If they go bust and can’t pay your pension, you’re usually protected by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pensionprotectionfund.org.uk/" title="Pension Protection Fund">Pension Protection Fund.</a> </p>

<p>The Pension Protection Fund usually pays:</p>

<ul>
<li>100% compensation if you’ve reached the scheme’s pension age </li>
  <li>90% compensation if you’re below the scheme’s pension age</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fraud, theft or bad management</h2>

<p>If there’s a shortfall in your company’s pension fund because of fraud or theft, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pensionprotectionfund.org.uk/" title="Pension Protection Fund">Pension Protection Fund</a>  may be able to recover some of the money.</p>

</ul></article><article id="managing-your-pension"><header><h1>Part 5: Managing your pension</h1>
  </header><h2>Find out how much you’ve saved</h2>

<p>Your pension provider will usually send you a statement each year to tell you how much is in your pension pot. You can also ask them for an estimate of how much you’ll get.</p>

<h2>What you see on your payslip</h2>

<p>You don’t need to do anything to get <a href="/income-tax-reliefs/pension-contributions-tax-relief" title="pension contributions tax relief">‘tax relief’</a> on your pension contributions. But, depending on what type of arrangements your employer has made, you may see details of your pension contributions on your payslip. Check with your employer which type of arrangement they use.</p>

<h3>‘Net pay’</h3>

<p>Your employer takes your contribution and <a href="/income-tax-reliefs/pension-contributions-tax-relief" title="pension contributions tax relief">‘tax relief’</a> from your pay before it’s taxed. You only pay tax on what’s left.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The amount you’ll see on your payslip is your contribution plus the tax relief added together.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t pay tax (eg because you earn less than the tax threshold) you won’t get tax relief.</p>

<h3>‘Relief at source’</h3>

<p>Your employer takes your pension contribution after taking tax and National Insurance from your pay. However much you earn, your pension provider adds <a href="/income-tax-reliefs/pension-contributions-tax-relief" title="pension contributions tax relief">‘tax relief’</a> to your contribution and adds it to your pension pot.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>With ‘relief at source’, you’ll only see your contributions on your payslip.</p>
</div>

<p>If you pay higher or additional rate Income Tax, you may be able to <a href="/income-tax-reliefs/pension-contributions-tax-relief" title="Pension contributions: tax relief">claim money back</a>.</p>

<h2>Tracing lost pensions</h2>

<p>If you lose track of pensions that you’ve paid into over the years, the <a href="/find-lost-pension" title="Find a lost pension">Pension Tracing Service</a> could help you find them.</p>

<h2>Nominate someone to get your pension if you die</h2>

<p>You may be able to nominate (choose) someone to get your pension if you die before reaching the scheme’s pension age. You can do this when you first join the pension or by writing to your provider.  </p>

<p>Ask your pension provider if this is possible and how much the person would get. </p>

<p>You can change your nomination at any time. It’s important to keep this information and the person’s contact details up to date. </p>

<p>Sometimes the pension provider can pay the money to someone else (eg if the person you nominated can’t be found or has died).</p>

<h2>How your pension is paid</h2>

<p>When you want to start getting your pension, you’ll need to <a href="/personal-pensions-your-rights/how-your-pension-is-paid" title="how a pension is paid">decide how you want it to be paid</a>.</p>

</article><article id="changing-jobs-and-taking-leave"><header><h1>Part 6: Changing jobs and taking leave</h1>
  </header><h2>If you change jobs</h2>

<p>Your workplace pension still belongs to you. If you don’t carry on paying into the scheme, the money will still be invested and you’ll get a pension when you reach the scheme’s pension age.</p>

<p>You can join another workplace scheme if you get a new job.</p>

<p>If you do, you may be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>carry on making contributions to your old pension </li>
  <li>combine the old and new pension schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask your pension providers about your options.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you move jobs but pay into an old pension, you may not get some of its benefits - check if they’re only available to current workers.</p>
</div>

<h2>Paid leave</h2>

<p>During paid leave, you and your employer carry on making pension contributions. </p>

<p>The amount you contribute is based on your actual pay during this time, but your employer pays contributions based on the salary you would have received if you weren’t on leave.  </p>

<h2>Maternity and other parental leave</h2>

<p>You and your employer will usually still make pension contributions while you’re on leave - check your employer’s maternity policy.</p>

<h2>Unpaid leave</h2>

<p>You may be able to make contributions if you want to - check with your employer or the pension scheme provider.</p>

<h2>If you become self-employed or stop working</h2>

<p>You may be able to carry on contributing to your workplace pension - ask the scheme provider.</p>

<p>You could use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nestpensions.org.uk/" title="NEST: National Employment Saving Trust">National Employment Saving Trust (NEST)</a> - a workplace pension scheme that self-employed people or sole directors of limited companies can use. </p>

<p>You could set up a <a href="/personal-and-stakeholder-pensions" title="Personal and stakeholder pensions">personal or stakeholder pension</a>.</p>

<p>You can get <a href="/workplace-pensions/get-help-and-advice" title="Get help and advice">help and advice</a>.</p>


</article><article id="if-you-want-to-leave-your-workplace-pension-scheme"><header><h1>Part 7: If you want to leave your workplace pension scheme</h1>
  </header><p>What to do if you want to leave a workplace pension depends on whether you’ve been ‘automatically enrolled’ in it or not.</p>

<h2>You weren’t ‘automatically enrolled’</h2>

<p>Check with your employer - they will tell you what to do.</p>

<h2>If you’ve been ‘automatically enrolled’</h2>

<p>Your employer will have sent you a letter telling you that you’ve been added to the scheme.</p>

<p>You can leave (called ‘opting out’) if you want to. </p>

<p>If you do it within a month of your employer adding you to the scheme, you’ll get back any money you’ve already paid in.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you opt out later, you may not be able to get your payments refunded - they will usually stay in your pension until you retire.</p>
</div>

<p>You can opt out by contacting your pension provider. Your employer must tell you how to do this. </p>

<h3>Reducing your payments</h3>

<p>You may be able to reduce the amount you contribute to your workplace pension for a short time instead of leaving. Check with both your employer and your pension provider to see if you can do this and how long you can do it for.</p>

<h2>Opting back in</h2>

<p>You can do this at any time by writing to your employer. They have to accept you back into their workplace scheme once in every 12 months.</p>

<h2>Rejoining automatically</h2>

<p>Once you’ve left your employer’s scheme, they will automatically enroll you back into their scheme after 3 years, as long as you still qualify. Your employer will write to you when they do this.</p>

</article><article id="get-help-and-advice"><header><h1>Part 8: Get help and advice</h1>
  </header><h2>When you might want more advice</h2>

<p>You might want to get advice before joining a workplace pension in some specific circumstances.</p>

<h3>You’re already paying into a personal pension</h3>

<p>Check whether it’s better for you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>carry on with your personal pension alone</li>
  <li>stop paying into your personal pension and join your workplace pension</li>
  <li>keep paying into both</li>
</ul>
<h3>You already expect your pension pot to be more than £1.5 million</h3>

<p>You may have to pay a tax charge unless you already have:</p>

<ul>
<li>primary protection</li>
  <li>enhanced protection</li>
  <li>fixed protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Joining a workplace pension scheme may affect this.</p>
