<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The ATEX Directive is a European Single Market Directive that applies to electrical and mechanical equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres.</p>

<p>The Directive replaces two previous Directives on electrical equipment for use in potentially explosive atmospheres (76/117/EC and 82/130/EC). It was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 23 March 1994 and came into force on 1 March 1996.</p>

<h2 id="atex-directive-what-it-applies-to">ATEX Directive: what it applies to</h2>

<p>The Directive applies to both electrical and mechanical equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>equipment and protective systems for use within potentially explosive atmospheres</li>
  <li>devices for use outside potentially explosive atmospheres, but which are required for, or contribute to the safe functioning of equipment and protective systems located inside such atmospheres</li>
  <li>components relating to the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential for explosive atmospheres can exist in a range of mainly industrial locations such as mines, factories, agricultural silos, and oil and gas platforms, water and other chemical processing environments. There is a wide range of products intended for use in such areas, including control equipment and sensors, transformers, fans, pumps, compressors, fork lift trucks, and lighting.</p>

<h2 id="legislation-of-atex-products">Legislation of ATEX products</h2>

<p>Legislation enables the free trading of ATEX products within the EEA by removing the need for separate documentation and testing for each individual European market. Manufacturers may use a single CE mark on their products to show compliance with this (and any other relevant) Directive.</p>

<p>The Directive has been implemented in Great Britain by The Equipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (SI 1996 No.192) which came into force on 1 March 1996. The Regulations were amended by SI 2001 No.3766 which came into force on 21 December 2001. The amendment principally covers the concept of “putting into service”.</p>

<p>The Regulations and the amendment are available to download from <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi" title="The Office of Public Sector Information.">The Office of Public Sector Information</a> (OPSI).</p>

<p>The Directive was implemented separately in Northern Ireland on 29 July 1996 (SR 1996/247).</p>

<h3 id="related-regulations">Related regulations</h3>

<p>The ATEX 137 Workplace Directive 1999/92/EC, (also known as the ‘Use’ Directive) is implemented by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) as The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002 (DSEAR) (SI 2002/2776) in the UK.</p>

<p>Guidance to DSEAR is published by HSE. For further information please visit the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/fireandexplosion/atex.htm" title="Safety Policy Directorate's website.">Safety Policy Directorate’s website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-approach-directives-and-the-free-movement-of-goods-in-the-european-community">New Approach Directives and the free movement of goods in the European Community</h2>

<p>The free movement of goods lies at the heart of achieving an open market for business in Europe. In May 1985, European Community Ministers agreed on a “New Approach to Technical Harmonisation and Standards” to fulfil this objective.</p>

<p>“New Approach” Directives (that is Community Law) set out the essential requirements (on safety for example), written in general terms which must be met before products may be sold in the UK or anywhere else in the European Community. European harmonised standards provide the detailed technical information enabling manufacturers to meet the essential requirements. The directives also explain how manufacturers are able to demonstrate conformity with the essential requirements. Products which meet the essential requirements are to display the CE marking, as described in the particular directive, which means that the products can be sold anywhere in the Community/EEA.</p>

<p>A list of <a rel="external" href="http://www.ec.europa.eu./enterprise/policies/european-standards/documents/harmonised-standards-legislation/list-references/index_en.htm" title="References to harmonised standards.">references to harmonised standards</a> in the context of the “New Approach” Directives can be found on the European Commission website.</p>

<h3 id="main-features-of-the-legislation">Main features of the legislation</h3>

<p>Legislation is limited to goal-setting essential health and safety requirements
Standards bodies draw up the technical specifications - European Standards - needed to ensure conformity with these requirements
The standards are voluntary
Products made to European Standards enjoy a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directives.</p>

<h2 id="electromagnetic-compatibility">Electromagnetic Compatibility</h2>

<p>The Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive 2004/108/EC, which is implemented into UK law by the Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2006, applies to most electrical and electronic apparatus.</p>

<h3 id="subject-area-1">Subject area</h3>

<p>The Directive applies to most electrical and electronic apparatus, that is, finished products and systems that include electrical and electronic equipment. Its intention is to remove barriers to trade within the European Economic Area whilst ensuring that the electromagnetic disturbance generated by apparatus does not exceed a level allowing radio and telecommunications equipment and other apparatus to operate as intended, and that apparatus has an adequate level of intrinsic immunity to electromagnetic disturbance to enable it to operate as intended.</p>

<p>The EMC Directive 2004/108/EC was adopted on 15 December 2004 and published in the Official Journal on 6 January 2005. It replaces and repeals Directive 89/336/EC.</p>

<p>Directive 2004/108/EC was transposed into UK Law by the EMC Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/3418), which came into force on 20 July 2007 These Regulations replaced and repealed the Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2005.</p>

<p>The Regulations require that all electrical and electronic apparatus marketed in the UK, including imports, satisfy the requirements of the EMC Directive. The Regulations implement a separate regime for Fixed Installations.</p>

<h3 id="intention-of-legislation-1">Intention of legislation</h3>

<p>To remove barriers to trade and ensure open means of access by Member States to Community markets.</p>

<h2 id="machinery-directive">Machinery Directive</h2>

<p>Overview of the new Machinery Directive to assist Industry in their understanding of it.</p>

<p>This Directive, 2006/42/EC, replaces Directive 98/37/EC with effect from 29 December 2009</p>

<h3 id="subject-area-4">Subject area</h3>

<p>The Directive places requirements on manufacturers to ensure their products, when supplied, are safe. Its scope covers industrial machines to domestic appliances. Where the provision of other EC directives apply eg. the Low Voltage Directive, these must be taken into account in order to achieve full compliance with the Directive.</p>

<h3 id="intention-of-legislation-4">Intention of legislation</h3>

<p>To assist industry by reducing barriers to trade within the Single Market by ensuring a common policy of safety and supply of machinery across the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

<h3 id="coverage-3">Coverage</h3>

<p>Essentially most machines which are either complete or partly completed and which have at least one moving part, assemblies such as those in bottling or car assembly plants, interchangeable equipment which can modify the function of a machine, and safety components.</p>

<p>There is a strong emphasis on safety and some products which are perceived to have a higher than normal safety risk to the operator require third party testing carried out by an appointed Notified Body which will have been assessed for its technical competence to carry out this work. Such items are identified in Annex IV of the Directive.</p>

<h3 id="current-position-1">Current position</h3>

<p>You should be aware that the European Commission published a Decision dated 19 January 2012 requiring Member States to prohibit the placing on the market of flail-type cutting attachments for portable hand-held brush cutters. This does not require an amendment to the Supply of Machinery Regulations 2009 and can be dealt with under existing legislation in the UK. The Health &amp; Safety Executive is the enforcement agency for this type of equipment and they have issued a safety notice on their website requiring suppliers to stop supplying the flail cutters. A copy of the Commission Decision can be sent by email on request.</p>

<p>Directive 2006/42/EC is implemented into UK law by means of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20081597_en_1" title="Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1597).">Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1597)</a>.</p>

<p>Machinery in the supply chain prior to 29 December 2009 is subject to the requirements of Directive 98/37/EC. </p>

<h3 id="guidance-1">Guidance</h3>

<p>To aid industry, the department has published guidance notes on the UK Regulations, which, in Annex N details additional sources of references (see Related Documents).</p>

<p>It also produces periodic reports on the meetings of the Machinery Directive Working Group in advance of the official Commission minutes.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/mechanical/files/machinery/guide_application_directive_2006-42-ec-2nd_edit_6-2010_en.pdf" title="Guidance on the Machinery Directive.">a comprehensive body of guidance on the Directive</a> has been published by the European Commission.

<h2 id="recreational-craft-directives-9425ec-and-200344ec">Recreational Craft Directives 94/25/EC and 2003/44/EC</h2>

<p>The Recreational Craft Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1464) implement into UK law the Recreational Craft Directives (94/25/EC and 2003/44/EC). They apply to recreational craft and are intended to promote the free movement of goods and safety, as well as noise and exhaust emissions of some engines.</p>

<h3 id="overview-4">Overview</h3>

<p>The Recreational Craft Directive (RCD) applies to recreational craft (such as personal watercraft, narrow boats and luxury motor yachts) measuring between 2.5 and 24 metres hull length, regardless of the means of propulsion, and intended for sport and leisure purposes.  This includes: partly completed recreational craft and specific components such as engine ignition systems, steering systems, fuel systems etc. as referred to in Annex II of the RCD. A consolidated version of the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/maritime/recreational-craft/index_en.htm" title="Recreational Craft Directive.">Recreational Craft Directive</a> is available from the European website.</p>

<h3 id="am-i-affected-3">Am I Affected?</h3>

<p>If you manufacture or otherwise place on the EU market craft or components coming within the scope of the RCD you will need to comply with the essential requirements. You will need to provide evidence that your product has been through the appropriate conformity assessment process.  This will usually require the involvement of a Notified Body, but in some cases can be done by self certification.  Notified Bodies are appointed by the UK and other Member States, under the RCD to perform certain tasks to assist manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with the RCD.  A list of Notified Bodies appointed by EU Member States can be found on the NANDO database. The product will need to carry CE marking and the manufacturer will need to issue a Declaration of Conformity (DoC).</p>

<p>CAUTION: The Department is aware of cases where organisations claim (or appear to claim) to be notified bodies authorised to carry out conformity assessment and certification when they actually hold no such appointment. Please see further information in the attached <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/w/10-1184-warning-organisations-falsely-claiming-notified-bodies.doc" title="Warning note about cases where organisations claim (or appear to claim) to be notified bodies authorised to carry out conformity assessment and certification when they actually hold no such appointment.">warning note</a>. (DOC, 42 Kb) .</p>

<p>There are a number of exclusions from the Directive including canoes, kayaks, surfboards, craft specifically designed to be crewed and to carry passengers for commercial purposes, hydrofoils etc. It is for the manufacturer to decide whether his product is covered by the exclusions.</p>

<h3 id="advice-to-consumers">Advice to Consumers</h3>

<p>Any recreational craft placed on the market in the EU must meet the essential requirements of the RCD including a number relating to safety.  It is important that consumers are able to purchase or hire products that they can be confident are as safe as they can be. Should you become aware or suspect that products placed on the market, do not provide this confidence, you should report your concerns to your local authority trading standards office.  Trading Standards are the enforcement authority for the RCD and can look into your complaint and take action if appropriate.  You are of course free to raise any concerns you have with us in BIS while we will be able to assist in the understanding of the requirements of the Directive and will be able to discuss policy issues, you should be aware that, where the relevant enforcement authority is trading standards, we will be unable to do other than refer you to them.   </p>

<p>Information on your rights as a consumer and how to make a complaint can be found in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/consumer-protection-rights" title="Consumer Rights.">Consumer Rights</a> page.       </p>

<h3 id="latest-developments-4">Latest Developments</h3>

<p>The European Commission published a proposal for revision of the RCD on 26th July.  As with a number of other product directives the RCD is being revised to take account of the requirements of the New Legislation Framework (NLF).  It has also been opened up for a full review of scope, essential requirements and administrative procedures. A copy of the Proposal and accompanying documents can be found at: <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/maritime/recreational-craft/index_en.htm" title="Recreational Craft.">Recreational Craft</a>.</p>

<p>The proposal will be presented for a first reading at the European Parliament, and also to the Council of Ministers.  There is no indication yet as to when this will happen.  This will be the start of a negotiation phase that will last for around eighteen months to two years.  Once it has been adopted the proposal will require putting into UK Law. BIS will consult on the proposal to a wide range of stakeholders, in order to ensure that as many people as possible have a chance to have their say on the proposals.  We will then look at the responses we receive and consider which comments or suggestions we can take forward in the UK negotiation line. We shall also meet with stakeholders where appropriate as issues arise and if necessary hold meetings or workshops where this might be helpful.  </p>
