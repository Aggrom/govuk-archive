<p>Entitlement for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> is at your Duty Station - although you may be eligible to apply for surplus <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> at other locations.</p>

<li>type D - 4 bedrooms</li>

  <li>type III - 4 bedrooms</li>
  <li>type IV - 4 bedrooms</li>

<h3 id="how-do-i-apply-for-sfa">How do I apply for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>?</h3>

<p>If you are entitled - you will need to complete and submit an application using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forms" title="MOD Form 1132: Application to Occupy Service Family Accommodation (SFA)"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Form 1132: Application to Occupy Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>)</a>. Please see the Detail section at the foot of the Forms page.</p>

<p>To make it easier to apply for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, an electronic version of the application form (<a href="/government/publications/forms" title="e-1132 form">e-1132 form</a>) is available on the Defence Intranet. You can only use this online form when accessing it from a <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> internal system.</p>

<p>The Self Preference functionality of the  <a href="/government/publications/forms" title="e-1132 form">e-1132 form</a> system is now live. The extension of the existing system provides you with additional online functions - such as being able to view available properties that match your entitlement and register your top three preferences in order. Also - once an offer for a property has been made and accepted, you will be able to book your Move In (and where appropriate Move Out) appointment, as well as electronically signing your licence to occupy. </p>

<p>All Service personnel are expected to use the online <a href="/government/publications/forms" title="e-1132 form">e-1132 form</a> form unless you are on Operations or do not readily have access to the Defence Intranet.</p>

<p>For data security reasons the electronic  <a href="/government/publications/forms" title="e-1132 form">e-1132 form</a> is only accessible when logged on to an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> computer system that has access to the Defence Intranet. If you are currently on an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> system - please follow the link above.</p>

<h3 id="housing-allocations-service-centre-hasc">Housing Allocations Service Centre (<abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you apply using the <a href="/government/publications/forms" title="e-1132 form">e-1132 form</a>, you can track your application online. However, if you do have an allocations enquiry, the Housing Allocations Service Centre (<abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr>) is the primary point of contact. The <abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> has a total of eight dedicated teams which cover different parts of the UK.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-get-an-application-form">Where can I get an application form?</h3>

<p>Service personnel are expected to use the  <a href="/government/publications/forms" title="e-1132 form">e-1132 form</a>, which is available on the Defence Intranet - please follow the link above.</p>

<p>For personnel on Operations or based overseas without access to the Defence Intranet, the paper form is available online via this website, from the Housing Allocations Service Centre, your local HIVE or your local Unit Welfare Office. However, please complete your form carefully as illegible or incomplete forms will be returned and your allocation will be delayed.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-i-apply-for-sfa">When should I apply for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>?</h3>

<p>You need to apply online or submit your <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Form 1132 to the <abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> covering your new location as soon as you receive your Assignment Order. If this is within four months of your posting date, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation will aim to make you a provisional offer within 15 working days. If you make any application earlier than this, we will try our best to make you an early offer, however, we are not obliged to do so until the four month point.</p>

<p>If you already live in an <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, don’t forget you are required to notify the Housing Allocations Service Centre that you have been assigned, within 14 days of receiving your Assignment Order. It is also mandatory that you book a Pre-Move Out Advisory Visit with the <abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> two months before your Move Out.</p>

<p>Eligible Service personnel may also apply for Service Family Accommodation at other times, such as on getting married or when you wish to move from private accommodation to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>. In these cases, applicants should submit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forms" title="MOD Form 1132"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Form 1132</a> as early as possible in advance of the required Move In date.</p>

<p>Can I specify when and where I wish to move?</p>

<p>You are asked to provide <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation with the date you require the property. This is known as your Required Date and can be any date you choose as long as it is within 28 days either side of your Assignment Date. You can also specify any personal preferences on your application form and where possible, these will be taken into account.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-dont-wish-to-accept-the-offer">What if I don’t wish to accept the offer?</h3>

<p>If you refuse the offer because it is not to your entitlement, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation will try and make a further offer within the original 15 working days. If you refuse the offer for personal reasons you will be placed on a waiting list but there is no guarantee of when, or indeed if, a future offer will be made.
You should be aware that you are not likely to be granted permission to retain <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> at your old duty station and therefore you may need to make your own arrangements for accommodation whilst you wait for a second offer.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-the-property-you-have-accepted-is-not-available-when-you-come-to-move-in">What if the property you have accepted is not available when you come to move in?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation will confirm the offer and address of the <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> 28 days prior to your Required Date. If, for any reason, we are unable to confirm the original offer you will be offered either alternative <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, Substitute <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (but only in exceptional circumstances), or the option to remain on the waiting list.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-my-family-or-i-have-any-special-requirements">What if my family or I have any special requirements?</h3>

<p>Please provide details at the point of application using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forms" title="MOD Form 1132"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Form 1132</a>, enclosing any reports from the appropriate professional source. It is important that <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation is made aware of special requirements at the earliest opportunity. A simple <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/service-family-accommodation-application-flowcharts" title="SFA application flowcharts">flowchart</a> offering guidance on the process is available.</p>

<h3 id="who-do-i-have-to-inform-if-i-want-to-keep-a-pet-in-sfa">Who do I have to inform if I want to keep a pet in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>?</h3>

<p>You must obtain written consent before keeping any domestic pets, for example dogs, cats, rabbits, other small caged animals or birds. Please provide details when you complete your  <a href="/government/publications/forms" title="e-1132 form">e-1132 form</a> or <a href="/government/publications/forms" title="MOD Form 1132"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Form 1132</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-find-out-about-removal-services-if-i-currently-live-in-sfa">How do I find out about removal services if I currently live in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>?</h3>

<p>If you are applying for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, and currently reside in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, please remember to book your removals. <a rel="external" href="https://grms.agilitylogistics.com" title="Agility Logistics Limited (Agility)">Agility Logistics Limited (Agility)</a> is the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> approved service provider for removals and is part of the Global Removal Management Services (<abbr title="Global Removal Management Services">GRMS</abbr>). </p>

<p>The Housing Allocations Service Centre (<abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr>) will write to you to confirm the details of Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>) plus the date and the time of your agreed Move In.</p>

<p>On that date, a Housing Officer will meet you at the property and show you around - which will give you the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
<li>familiarise yourself with your new home, its fixtures, fittings and appliances.</li>
  <li>read electricity/gas meters and measure levels in oil tanks.</li>
  <li>take possession of the keys.</li>
  <li>identify who is responsible for any repair or maintenance queries.</li>
  <li>confirm that there is a valid Gas Safety Certificate in the <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>.</li>
  <li>complete and sign the Move In documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the Move In can only take place during normal working hours.</p>

<p>You can give your Spouse/Civil Partner or a Service colleague written authority (known as a Proxy Certificate) to sign the inventory on your behalf if you are unable to attend the Move In.</p>

<p>If you are moving from one <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (not Substitute <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>) to another, you have two weeks to hand it back and provided you do so within this time you will only be charged for one property. If you exceed this period you may be charged for both properties. </p>

<h3 id="welcome-pack">Welcome Pack</h3>

<p>Service personnel and their families moving into <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> will receive a Welcome Pack from the Housing Officer.</p>

<p>This pack contains a short amount of key information such as where to find further information about Service Family Accommodation on this website, the numbers to call to request maintenance/repairs (including a handy key ring and fridge magnet), a <abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> map and where available will include useful local information. Useful information is also available from your local HIVE.</p>

<p>A new Move In customer questionnaire is also included in the pack so that <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation can gather information about the quality of the service provided and determine where can make further improvements.</p>

<p>The folders are also a handy place to store information about your Service Family Accommodation, such as the Gas Safety Certificate.</p>

<h3 id="licence-to-occupy-insurance">Licence to occupy insurance</h3>

<p>When you live in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> you should ensure that you have adequate insurance. In addition to arranging contents insurance to protect your personal possessions, you are strongly recommended (in accordance with JSP 464) to take out Licence to Occupy insurance. This specialist insurance covers your potential liability incurred as a result of damage to your <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> caused by you or your family - and would provide you with cover up to the required £20,000. This would include things like damage caused by kitchen fires, or flood damage as a result of failing to adequately protect and heat your home in Winter.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.siiap.org/" title="Services Insurance and Investment Advisory Panel (SIIAP)">Services Insurance and Investment Advisory Panel (SIIAP)</a> website provides details of insurers who can supply this insurance and includes links to a range of relevant insurance company websites. If you are unable to find relevant information on the websites available, we suggest that you call the insurer using the telephone numbers which are also provided. If you already have Kit insurance with one of these specialist insurers, it may be worth checking if you are already covered - as some insurance policies include Licence to Occupy insurance.</p>

<h2 id="moving-out">Moving out</h2>

<p>Moving home can be a very busy and stressful time. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation aims to make your move as easy and stress free for you and your family as possible.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-book-a-move-out">How do I book a Move Out?</h3>

<p>You need to inform the Housing Allocations Service Centre (<abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr>) when you have been re-assigned within 14 days of receiving your Assignment Order. You are also required to book a Pre Move-Out Advisory Visit (PMOAV) with the <abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> up to two months prior to your expected Move Out date.</p>

<p>See Points of contact page and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-allocations-service-centre-hasc" title="HASC map"><abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> map</a>. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> telephone lines are open from 8.30 am - 3 pm Monday to Friday (except on Thursday - when they close at 12 pm for staff training and development).</p>

<h3 id="whats-a-pre-move-out-advisory-visit">What’s a Pre Move Out Advisory Visit?</h3>

<p>The Single Services have agreed that the Pre Move Out Advisory Visit (PMOAV) is mandatory and should be arranged by all occupants in advance of their Move Out.</p>

<p>The aim of the PMOAV is to advise you on the agreed Move Out standard, whilst also giving the Housing Officer (HO) the opportunity to assess any repair/maintenance work that may be necessary prior to the <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> being allocated to another family.</p>

<p>At your PMOAV, you will be given a <a href="/government/publications/pre-move-out-advisory-leaflets-for-sfa" title="pre-move out advisory leaflets">leaflet</a> explaining the standard required for Move Out.</p>

<p>The leaflet will also provide details of a voluntary Pre Payment Cleaning Scheme that may be available in your area - which can help reduce the stress of moving out.</p>

<p>The HO will be happy to answer any questions you may have on the Move Out process.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-on-my-move-out">What happens on my Move Out?</h3>

<p>Your Move Out will be attended by the HO who will inspect your <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> to see if it meets the agreed Move Out standard.</p>

<p>If the standard is not satisfactory and there are deficiencies or damages that are not considered to be fair wear and tear, a charge will be raised by the Housing Officer and you will be invoiced accordingly.</p>

<p>Once the HO has completed the inspection and has completed the move, an appropriate Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) action will then be taken by the <abbr title="Housing Allocations Service Centre">HASC</abbr> to cease accommodation charges on that property from the date of your Move Out.</p>

<h3 id="pre-payment-cleaning-scheme-england-and-wales">Pre Payment Cleaning Scheme (England and Wales)</h3>

<p>A Pre Payment Cleaning Scheme (PPCS) is available to all <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> occupants in England and Wales - this is the only cleaning scheme approved by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and Modern Housing Solutions. </p>

<p>If you wish to use this voluntary scheme please contact the approved cleaning contractor:</p>

<p>Ideal on 0800 038 7833 or 0777 222 8910. </p>

<p>The central helpdesk is manned by security cleared staff.</p>

<p>A representative will arrange to visit and provide you with a free, no obligation quote. This quote will be specific to your house and will reflect the amount of work required to get that particular property up to Move Out standard.</p>

<p>Occupants who do use the PPCS continue to be liable for any damages to the property, such as stains on carpets that cannot be removed, and they are still required to prepare the garden and garage to the Move Out standard.</p>

Each easy-to-follow, single page guide deals with specific topics and offers advice on guidance. </p>

<h3 id="licence-to-occupy-insurance-1">Licence to occupy insurance</h3>

<p>If you live in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> you should ensure that you have adequate insurance. In addition to arranging contents insurance to protect your personal possessions, you are strongly recommended (in accordance with JSP 464) to take out Licence to Occupy insurance.

If you already have Kit insurance with one of these specialist insurers, it may be worth checking if you are already covered - as some insurance policies include Licence to Occupy insurance.</p>

<p>In addition - here’s some useful guidance on how to look after your home properly.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-prevent-damage-to-my-heating-and-plumbing-system-during-cold-weather">What can I do to prevent damage to my heating and plumbing system during cold weather?</h3>

<p>You can prepare for cold weather by locating the position of the water main stopcock in your Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>) and checking that it operates in case you need it. You should also report to your prime contracting helpdesk any taps and cisterns that require attention and also any damage to insulation on outside pipe work. </p>

<p>During severe weather you are responsible for ensuring that the temperature in your <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> does not fall below 10°C. Keep doors of rooms without heating open to allow heat to circulate. In severe weather conditions, you could also slightly open your loft hatch to allow some warm air into the loft pipes.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-outdoor-pipes">What about outdoor pipes?</h3>

<p>You need to take special care with pipes leading outside the house. For outside taps you should shut off any isolating stopcock when not in use, and leave taps open. If you are unsure about what to do, please contact your maintenance contract helpdesk.</p>

<h3 id="what-precautions-should-i-take-if-i-am-going-away-in-cold-or-severe-weather">What precautions should I take if I am going away in cold or severe weather?</h3>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that adequate frost damage precautions are taken, as you could be liable for damage if it occurs. You should therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li>leave your central heating on permanently with the room thermostat set to a minimum of 10°C</li>
  <li>turn all radiator valves on to full, leave all internal doors open and slightly open your loft hatch if appropriate</li>
  <li>where possible, leave your keys with a trusted neighbour and ask them to check the house regularly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-i-do-to-minimise-the-risk-of-fire-in-my-home">What can I do to minimise the risk of fire in my home?</h3>

<p>Never leave cooking, burning cigarettes or lit candles unattended. These are the main causes of home fires in the UK. Keep matches and lighters out of the reach of children. Try to keep children and pets out of the kitchen during cooking and ensure your kitchen is clutter free. Keep lit candles away from flammable materials such as curtains and flower arrangements and out of the reach of children and pets.</p>

<p>What should I do if something catches fire in the kitchen?</p>

<p>If a pan catches fire, switch off the heat source and smother the fire by sliding a lid or damp wrung cloth over the pan. To prevent flare-ups hold the lid or cloth firmly in place until the pan has cooled.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>DO NOT</strong> attempt to remove it from the room.</li>
  <li>
<strong>NEVER</strong> throw water on a fat or oil fire.</li>
  <li>in case of an oven fire, close the door and turn of the heat.</li>
  <li>call the Fire Brigade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please also see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-fire-safety" title="Community fire safety">Community fire safety</a> guide.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-smell-gas">What should I do if I smell gas?</h3>

<p>If you smell gas, or suspect that you have a gas leak, you should extinguish all naked flames and cigarettes. Ventilate the property by opening windows and doors. Do not operate any electrical equipment (including telephones and mobiles) or light switches - but if anything is already switched on, leave it on. Evacuate the property and once outside call the Transco emergency number 0800 111 999 immediately.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-my-loft-for-storage">Can I use my loft for storage?</h3>

<p>You are not permitted to use the loft space in your <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> for storage purposes. Secure garages can however be used for this purpose. Care should be taken to ensure that all items stored in the garage are safe and suitable for such storage. No inflammable materials should be stored in the garage.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-a-condensation-problem-in-my-sfa-what-can-i-do-to-alleviate-this">I have a condensation problem in my <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>. What can I do to alleviate this?</h3>

<p>Double-glazing, central heating and modern kitchens and bathrooms are all improvements that result in warm and draft-free homes. Unfortunately, these ideal living conditions are also the perfect combination for condensation to occur.</p>

<p>You can also prevent condensation forming by taking the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>open the windows in your kitchen or bathroom when cooking or bathing or, where fitted, switch on extractor fans</li>
  <li>avoid drying damp clothes on radiators - use a clothes airer instead</li>
  <li>keep the ventilation grills on double-glazed windows open</li>
  <li>use adequate ventilation when operating tumble dryers. The effect is worse in winter when doors and windows are firmly shut.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to help prevent condensation in your <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> is to ventilate your property as often as possible and ensure any vents in walls are kept uncovered.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-pets">Keeping pets</h3>

<p>If you have been given permission to keep small domestic pets in your <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> by <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation, you are responsible for ensuring that they do not cause damage to the fabric of the property or the garden. You are also responsible for ensuring that your pets do not cause any nuisance to other families. You are also responsible for keeping your pet free of fleas and ensuring that at Move Out the property is more thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<h2 id="complaints">Complaints</h2>

<p>Both Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) Operations Accommodation and our contractors have a strong customer focus to provide the best service we can to Service personnel and their families. However, sometimes things go wrong so below is some useful advice and guidance on what you need to do if you wish to make a complaint - and what the correct procedure is.</p>

<p>Whatever the problem, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation will endeavour to sort it out as quickly as possible. We value your feedback and monitor complaints to help us focus on improving our service in those areas.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-complaint">What is a complaint?</h3>

<p>Complaints should not be confused with everyday enquiries, an appeal against an allocation or retention decision or requests for a service. For example if you report a defective boiler, this is a request for a repair. If we fail to carry out the repair, it may become a complaint.</p>

<p>A complaint may be about any aspect of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> service and may be about: </p>

<ul>
<li>impolite or unhelpful staff or contractors</li>
  <li>something being done wrongly</li>
  <li>a decision we have made following an appeal</li>
  <li>not operating our policies fairly or fulfilling our legal duties</li>
  <li>something not being done by <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-can-complain">Who can complain?</h3>

<p>Anyone who receives a service or who maybe entitled to receive a service from <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>. Broadly this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>licensees/occupants</li>
  <li>applicants</li>
  <li>advocates acting on behalf of licensees/occupants, including Councillors and MPs</li>
  <li>other parts of the Armed Forces or the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All complaints will be treated confidentially. We do not generally accept anonymous complaints, particularly as we are therefore unable to respond with an answer about the action we have taken.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-make-a-complaint">How can I make a complaint?</h3>

<p>We have a set 3 stage procedure for complaints to make sure that they can be fully investigated and promptly put right. If you are dissatisfied by the response at any stage, you will be given the opportunity to go to the next one.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-dio-deal-with-written-complaints">How does <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> deal with written complaints?</h3>

<p>If you make a written complaint we will acknowledge it within three working days. An investigation will be carried out but depending on the nature of the complaint, this can take some time. We do however aim to provide you with an update within 10 working days. If we need to arrange to meet with you, we aim to write to you within five days after the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-get-independent-advice">Where can I get independent advice?</h3>

<h2 id="about-dio-operations-accommodation">About <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Operations Accommodation</h2>

<p>Part of the Ministry of Defence, Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) Operations Accommodation is responsible for the provision of Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>) in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This includes planning to provide accommodation as and when required by the Armed Forces; improving the overall standard of properties; providing a comprehensive repair and maintenance service; managing allocations for highly mobile Service personnel; and overseeing Move Ins and Move Outs.</p>

<h3 id="management-of-sfa">Management of <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Overall responsibility for <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> within the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> rests with the Chief Executive of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> who delegates responsibility for delivering the housing service to the Head of Operations Accommodation, who in turn is accountable to the Director General Operations.</p>

<p>The responsibilities of the head of Operations Accommodation include: </p>

<ul>
<li>maintaining and improving the standard of <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>providing an effective and comprehensive repair and maintenance service</li>
  <li>the provision of an allocation service to house entitled and eligible personnel</li>
  <li>the provision of housing services to over 40,000 Service families and other occupants at any one time</li>
  <li>managing over 20,000 moves into and out of accommodation each year</li>
  <li>liaison and planning with Service chains of command to ensure their current and future needs are met</li>
  <li>contributing to local Service community support.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="further-background">Further background</h3>

<p>The majority of <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> housing in England and Wales is either leased from a private sector company below the current market rate from Annington Homes Limited (who bought most of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s housing stock in 1996),or is provided under the government’s Private Finance Initiative (<abbr title="Private Finance Initiative">PFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>Houses in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and some other areas, are mostly <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> owned.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> remains responsible for lease payments and the maintenance and upgrade of leased back properties.</p>

<p>In areas where <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> housing stock is unavailable, Service families may be provided with fully-serviced private rented properties - known as Substitute Service Family Accommodation (SSFA). This accommodation is sourced and leased on behalf of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> by a specialised contractor (the HCR Group).</p>

<h3 id="repair-and-maintenance">Repair and maintenance</h3>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is responsible for the maintenance of all <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> through the relevant Prime Contracts (except for properties provided under the Government’s Private Finance Initiative - <abbr title="Private Finance Initiative">PFI</abbr>). </p>

<p>This comprehensive service is free to occupants, who have very little responsibility for the maintenance of their <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> - this mainly includes maintaining the garden and minor maintenance such as replacing standard light bulbs and fuses.</p>

<h3 id="more-information-4">More information</h3>

<p>The requirement for both <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (and Single Living Accommodation) is constantly changing as the Defence estate is rationalised to support operational capability and as individual preferences change. </p>
