{"alternative_title":"","body":"$!\r\nUsually, if you\u2019ve charged your customers less VAT than you\u2019ve paid on your purchases, HM Revenue & Customs repay you the difference.\r\n$! \r\n\r\nWhen you complete the boxes on your VAT Return the information you enter will show you the: \r\n\r\n+ total amount of VAT charged - Box 3 \r\n+ total amount of VAT paid - Box 4 \r\n\r\nYou\u2019re due a repayment if the figure in Box 3 is less than the figure in Box 4. \r\n\r\nHow much you\u2019re repaid is the figure shown in Box 5 of your VAT Return. \r\n\r\n##How long does it take? \r\n\r\nRepayments are usually paid electronically into your bank account within 10 working days of HMRC getting your VAT Return. \r\n\r\nSometimes it takes longer and may do if HMRC have any queries about your VAT. \r\n\r\nIf it takes longer than 30 working days you may get compensation (known as a \u2018repayment supplement\u2019). This is either \u00a350 or 5% of your repayment (whichever is the higher amount). You won\u2019t get compensation if, for example, your VAT Returns have been late or incorrect. HMRC will write and let you know.\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenue & Customs\r\n*[VAT]: Value Added Tax\r\n\r\n","overview":"VAT repayments -  work out if you're due a VAT repayment using your VAT Return","slug":"vat-repayments","title":"VAT repayments","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:14:40+00:00","type":"answer"}
