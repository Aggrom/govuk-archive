  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The police can stop a vehicle for any reason. If they ask you to stop, you should always pull over. You’re breaking the law if you don’t.</p>

<p>If you’re stopped, the police can ask to see your:</p>

<ul>
<li>driving licence</li>
  <li>insurance certificate</li>
  <li>MOT certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t have these documents with you, you have 7 days to take them to a police station. You’re breaking the law if you don’t show the requested documents within 7 days.</p>

<p>The police can also give you an on-the-spot fixed penalty notice for many minor offences and make you take a breath test in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>You can also have your vehicle seized if you’re stopped on suspicion of driving without insurance and for some other offences.</p>

</article><article id="breath-tests"><header><h1>Part 2: Breath tests</h1>
  </header><p>The police can stop you at any time and ask you to take a breath test (‘breathalyse’ you) if:</p>

<ul>
<li>they think you’ve been drinking</li>
  <li>you’ve committed a traffic offence</li>
  <li>you’ve been involved in a road traffic accident</li>
</ul>
<p>If you refuse to take a breath test, or fail to supply a sample of breath and don’t have a ‘reasonable excuse’, you can be arrested. A reasonable excuse could be a genuine physical or mental condition stopping you from giving a sample.</p>

<p>The breath test gives a result straight away. If it shows you’re not over the drink drive limit, you must be allowed to go.</p>

<p>If you fail the breath test, you’ll be taken to a police station and given 2 more breath tests. If they’re positive, you may be charged.</p>

<p>If you fail a breath test you can’t drive your car until you are sober. You can ask someone else to collect your car for you.</p>

</article><article id="minor-motoring-offences"><header><h1>Part 3: Minor motoring offences</h1>
  </header><p>The police can give you a ‘fixed penalty notice’ for many of the less serious traffic offences. If you get a fixed penalty notice this can result in a fine and/or penalty points on your licence.  </p>

<p>If you build up 12 points within 3 years you could be disqualified from driving.</p>

<p>However, for minor offences the police also have the option of:</p>

<ul>
<li>taking no action</li>
  <li>issuing a warning</li>
  <li>offering driver training (in some cases)</li>
  <li>prosecuting you</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you disagree with a fixed penalty notice</h2>

<p>You can choose not to pay the fixed penalty if you believe that it was given unjustly, but you’ll have to argue your case in court. </p>

</article><article id="faults-with-your-vehicle"><header><h1>Part 4: Faults with your vehicle</h1>
  </header><p>If your vehicle has something wrong with it, eg a broken brake light, the police may give you a ‘vehicle defect rectification notice’.</p>

<p>You’ll need to get your vehicle fixed and provide proof that it’s been fixed (eg a receipt for the work from a mechanic). You have 14 days from the date of the notice to show the proof to the police.</p>

</article><article id="when-the-police-can-seize-your-vehicle"><header><h1>Part 5: When the police can seize your vehicle</h1>
  </header><p>The police can seize a vehicle if they think it’s being used in a way that causes alarm, harassment or distress (eg careless or inconsiderate driving).</p>

<p>They can also seize a vehicle if they think it’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>being driven by someone who doesn’t have a proper licence or insurance</li>
  <li>dangerously, illegally or obstructively parked</li>
  <li>broken-down or abandoned</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your vehicle is seized there’s a ‘release fee’ of up to £200 plus a storage fee of £20 for every day or part day.</p>
