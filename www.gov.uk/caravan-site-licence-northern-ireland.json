","licence_overview":"$! Contact your local district council for a licence if you live in Northern Ireland and want to use your land as a caravan site. $!\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need a licence to run a caravan site if:\r\n\r\n- you have a caravan that you don't live in on land around your home\r\n- a person brings a caravan onto the site, stays no more than 2 nights and there aren't any other caravans on the site\r\n- 3 or less caravans are on the site for no more than 28 days a year\r\n- forestry workers, builders, travelling showmen or seasonal workers (like fruit pickers) stay in caravans on the site\r\n- the site is owned, occupied, supervised or approved by an organisation like a caravan club that has a caravan licence exemption certificate\r\n\r\n##Restrictions\r\n\r\n^You must have planning permission for the caravan site before you apply for a licence.^\r\n\r\nThe district council may put conditions on the licence like:\r\n\r\n- restricting the length of time caravans are allowed on the site\r\n- restricting the total number of caravans \r\n- saying what type of caravans are allowed\r\n- saying where caravans and any buildings should be \r\n- providing and maintaining toilet and washing facilities\r\n- providing and maintaining equipment to use in case of a fire\r\n- making changes to landscaping on the site (eg planting bushes or trees to protect privacy around the site)\r\n- doing works on the land (eg improving road access)\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with the conditions, you may be able to appeal to a local magistrates court. \r\n\r\n^You can't apply if you've had a caravan licence withdrawn in the last 3 years.^\r\n\r\n###Changes \r\nThe district council can change these conditions at any time. If the council asks you to return the licence to do this, you must send it back it within 7 days. \r\n\r\n###Inspections\r\nYou must allow a district council inspector onto your site so that they can see:\r\n\r\n- what conditions your licence should have and what work should be done on the site\r\n- whether you are keeping to all the conditions on your licence\r\n\r\n^You'll get 24 hours notice of an inspector's visit.^\r\n\r\n##How to apply\r\n\r\nContact your local district council to apply for a licence. Tell them which land you are going to use for the site.\r\n\r\nSend in any other information the council needs (eg a site plan, where the caravans are going to be put and any washing facilities) along with your application.\r\n\r\nYou may be charged a fee for a licence. \r\n\r\n^Your licence will last as long as you've planning permission for the caravan site.^\r\n\r\n##Displaying your licence\r\n\r\nYou must display the licence clearly on your caravan site .\r\n\r\n##Fines and penalties\r\n\r\nYou may be fined up to \u00a32,500 if you:\r\n\r\n- don't get a licence \r\n- break any licence conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updated_at":"2012-10-02T12:12:16+00:00"}],["tags",[{"title":"Business Link","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/businesslink.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":null,"type":"legacy_source"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=businesslink","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/businesslink"},"parent":null},{"title":"Licences and licence applications","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business%2Flicences.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Applying for licences from your council for events and businesses","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Flicences","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/licences"},"parent":{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[]]],"parts":null}
