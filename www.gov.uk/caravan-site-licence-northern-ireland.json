Contact your local district council for a licence if you live in Northern Ireland and want to use your land as a caravan site. $!\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need a licence to run a caravan site if:\r\n\r\n- you have a caravan that you don't live in on land around your home\r\n- a person brings a caravan onto the site, stays no more than 2 nights and there aren't any other caravans on the site\r\n- 3 or less caravans are on the site for no more than 28 days a year\r\n- forestry workers, builders, travelling showmen or seasonal workers (like fruit pickers) stay in caravans on the site\r\n- the site is owned, occupied, supervised or approved by an organisation like a caravan club that has a caravan licence exemption certificate\r\n\r\n##Restrictions\r\n\r\n^You must have planning permission for the caravan site before you apply for a licence.^\r\n\r\nThe district council may put conditions on the licence like:\r\n\r\n- restricting the length of time caravans are allowed on the site\r\n- restricting the total number of caravans \r\n- saying what type of caravans are allowed\r\n- saying where caravans and any buildings should be \r\n- providing and maintaining toilet and washing facilities\r\n- providing and maintaining equipment to use in case of a fire\r\n- making changes to landscaping on the site (eg planting bushes or trees to protect privacy around the site)\r\n- doing works on the land (eg improving road access)\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with the conditions, you may be able to appeal to a local magistrates court. \r\n\r\n^You can't apply if you've had a caravan licence withdrawn in the last 3 years.^\r\n\r\n###Changes \r\nThe district council can change these conditions at any time.
