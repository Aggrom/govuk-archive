  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>A tenancy agreement is a contract between you and a landlord. </p>

<p>It lets you live in a property as long as you pay rent and follow the rules. It also sets out the legal terms and conditions of your tenancy. It can be written down or oral.</p>

<p>A tenancy can either be:</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed-term (running for a set period of time)</li>
  <li>periodic (running on a week-by-week or month-by-month basis)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rights and responsibilities</h2>
<p>Both you and your landlord have certain <a href="/private-renting" title="Private renting rights and responsibilities">rights and responsibilities</a>, whether or not you have a tenancy agreement.</p>

</article><article id="tenancy-types"><header><h1>Part 2: Tenancy types</h1>
  </header><h2>Assured shorthold tenancies (<abbr title="Assured shorthold tenancies">ASTs</abbr>)</h2>
<p>The most common form of tenancy is an <abbr title="Assured shorthold tenancy">AST</abbr>. Most new tenancies are automatically this type. </p>

<p>A tenancy can be an <abbr title="Assured shorthold tenancy">AST</abbr> if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the property you rent is private</li>
  <li>your tenancy started on or after 15 January 1989</li>
  <li>the property is your main accommodation</li>
  <li>your landlord doesn’t live in the property</li>
</ul>
<p>A tenancy <strong>can’t</strong> be an <abbr title="Assured shorthold tenancy">AST</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it began or was agreed before 15 January 1989</li>
  <li>the rent is more than £100,000 a year </li>
  <li>the rent is less than £250 a year (less than £1,000 in London) </li>
  <li>it’s a business tenancy or tenancy of licensed premises</li>
  <li>it’s a holiday let</li>
  <li>your landlord is a local council</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other tenancies</h2>
<p>There are other tenancies that aren’t as common as <abbr title="Assured shorthold tenancies">ASTs</abbr>, including:</p>

<h3>Excluded tenancies or licences</h3>
<p>If you lodge with your landlord and share rooms with them, like a kitchen or bathroom, you may have one of these. You’ll usually have less protection from eviction with this type of agreement.</p>

<h3>Assured tenancies</h3>
<p>Tenancies starting between 15 January 1989 and 27 February 1997 may be assured. You’ll have increased protection from eviction with this type of agreement.</p>

<h3>Regulated tenancies</h3>
<p>Tenancies starting before 15 January 1989 may be regulated. You’ll have increased protection from eviction and can apply for a ‘fair rent’ . </p>

</article><article id="what-should-be-in-a-tenancy-agreement"><header><h1>Part 3: What should be in a tenancy agreement</h1>
  </header><p>If you have a tenancy agreement, it should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the names of all people involved</li>
  <li>the rental price and how it’s paid</li>
  <li>information on how and when the rent will be reviewed</li>
  <li>the deposit amount and how it will be <a href="/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview" title="Tenancy deposit protection">protected</a>
</li>
  <li>when the deposit can be fully or partly withheld (eg to repair damage you’ve caused)</li>
  <li>the property address</li>
  <li>the start and end date of the tenancy</li>
  <li>any tenant or landlord obligations</li>
  <li>which bills you’re responsible for</li>
</ul>
<p>It can also include information on:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether the tenancy can be ended early and how this can be done</li>
  <li>who’s responsible for minor repairs</li>
  <li>whether the property can be let to someone else (sublet) or have lodgers</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The terms of the tenancy must be fair and comply with the law.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re unsure of any terms in the agreement, get <a rel="external" href="http://legaladviserfinder.justice.gov.uk/AdviserSearch.do" title="Find a legal adviser">legal advice</a> before signing. Once you’re happy with it, sign the agreement and get a copy of it.</p>

<p>Citizens Advice has a guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/index/your_family/housing/tenancy_agreements.htm" title="Tenancy agreement guide - Citizens Advice">tenancy agreements.</a></p>

</article><article id="changes-to-tenancy-agreements"><header><h1>Part 4: Changes to tenancy agreements</h1>
  </header><p>Both you and your landlord must agree in order to change the terms of the tenancy agreement. </p>

<h2>Preventing discrimination</h2>
<p>Unless your landlord has a very strong reason, they must change anything in a tenancy agreement that might discriminate against you on the grounds of:</p>

<ul>
<li>sex</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>disability (or because of something connected with your disability)</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>being a transsexual person</li>
  <li>having just had a baby or being pregnant </li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> </p>

<p>You might need a guide dog in the house but a term in the tenancy says no pets are allowed. Your landlord must change the terms to allow guide dogs in the property, unless they have a very strong reason not to (eg another tenant in the property has a serious allergy to dogs).</p>
</div>

</article><article id="how-to-end-your-tenancy"><header><h1>Part 5: How to end your tenancy</h1>
  </header><h2>Tenancies</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your tenancy agreement should say how much notice you need to give your landlord before you leave the property.</p>
</div>

<p>You can usually end a fixed-term tenancy by giving your landlord written notice up to 2 months before the tenancy ends. Your tenancy will then finish at the end of the fixed-term.</p>

<p>You can end a periodic tenancy by giving notice at the end of a rent period. The period varies according to the rent term. For example, if you pay rent monthly, you’ll need to give a month’s notice.</p>

<h2>Licence agreements</h2>
<p>If your licence automatically runs out after a specific date and you want to end the agreement, you should let your landlord know this before your licence runs out.</p>

<p>Shelter has information about <a rel="external" href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/ending_a_tenancy_or_licence" title="Ending a tenancy or licence: Shelter">ending a tenancy or licence.</a></p>

<h2>Ending a tenancy early</h2>
<p>Unless there’s a break clause in your tenancy agreement, your landlord can insist you pay rent until the end of the tenancy.</p>

</div>

</article><article id="your-landlord-wants-to-end-your-tenancy"><header><h1>Part 6: Your landlord wants to end your tenancy</h1>
  </header><p>If your landlord wants you to leave, they must give you notice in a particular way, including certain information and warnings. This depends on the type of tenancy agreement and its terms.</p>

<h2>Assured shorthold tenancies (<abbr title="Assured shorthold tenancies">ASTs</abbr>)</h2>
<p>In some circumstances, your landlord can take back their property without giving any reason. To do this, all of the following must apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>they’ve protected your deposit in a <a href="/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview" title="Tenancy deposit protection">deposit protection scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>they’ve given you at least 2 months’ written notice that they want the property back (‘notice to quit’) and the date you must leave</li>
  <li>the date you must leave is at least 6 months after your original tenancy began (the one you had on first moving in)</li>
  <li>you have a periodic tenancy – or you have a fixed-term tenancy <strong>and</strong> your landlord isn’t asking you to leave before the end of the fixed term</li>
</ul>
<h3>During the fixed term</h3>
<p>If you’re still in the fixed term, your landlord can only ask you to leave if they have a <a href="/gaining-possession-of-a-privately-rented-property-let-on-an-assured-shorthold-tenancy" title="Gaining possession of a privately rented 
property let on an assured shorthold tenancy">ground (reason) for wanting possession</a> that’s in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/contents" title="Housing Act 1988">Housing Act 1988.</a></p>

<p>Examples of the grounds include:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re behind with your rent payments (‘in arrears’)</li>
  <li>you’ve used the property for illegal purposes (eg selling drugs)</li>
  <li>your landlord wants to move back into the property</li>
</ul>
<p>The notice period they must give varies from 2 weeks to 2 months, depending on the ground they’re using.</p>

<h2>Assured tenancies</h2>
<p>Your landlord will need to use one of the reasons or ‘grounds’ for possession in the Housing Act 1988. </p>

<p>The Department for Communities and Local Government has published a guide for tenants on assured and assured shorthold tenancies.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11603/138289.pdf" title="Download 'Assured and assured shorthold tenancies: a guide for tenants' (PDF, 370KB)">Download ‘Assured and assured shorthold tenancies: a guide for tenants’ (PDF, 370KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Excluded tenancies or licences</h2>
<p>You’ll often have an excluded tenancy or licence if you live with your landlord as a lodger and share rooms with them. </p>

<p>Your landlord only needs to give ‘reasonable notice’ to quit. Usually this means the length of the rental payment period – so if you pay rent weekly, you’ll get 1 week’s notice. </p>

<p>The notice doesn’t have to be in writing.</p>

<h2>Non-excluded tenancy or licence</h2>
<p>Your landlord can end the let at any time by serving a written ‘notice to quit’. The notice period will depend on the tenancy or agreement, but is often at least 4 weeks. </p>

<h2>Break clauses</h2>
<p>If there’s a break clause in the tenancy agreement, your landlord can give you notice after this. However, your landlord doesn’t have a guaranteed right to possession during the first 6 months of the tenancy.</p>

<h2>If you don’t leave the property</h2>
<p>If the notice period expires and you don’t leave the property, your landlord may start the process of <a href="/private-renting-evictions" title="Private renting: evictions">eviction</a> through the courts. </p>

<p>Your landlord can’t forcibly remove you without an eviction order.</p>
