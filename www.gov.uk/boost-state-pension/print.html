  </header><p>If you’re not paying National Insurance you may be able to get National Insurance credits. </p>

<p>Credits may help to fill in any gaps in your National Insurance record. This can mean  that you’ll still get the full State Pension and other benefits.</p>

<p>Credits are for people in certain circumstances, eg when you’re ill or unemployed and claiming benefits or when you don’t earn enough to pay National Insurance.</p>

<p>There are Class 1 and Class 3 credits. They both pay towards your State Pension but cover different benefits. </p>


</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 2: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>The list below shows if you may be able to get National Insurance credits. You may get your credits automatically, but in some cases you’ll have to apply for them</p>
