<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Chapter 85 of the Tariff covers a range of electrical and electronic machinery and equipment, including audio and video equipment.</p>

<p>This guide will help you to classify audio and video equipment for the purposes of the UK Trade Tariff - including sound and video recorders and players, radios, televisions, video monitors and digital cameras. The guide also covers parts and accessories for these types of equipment, as well as blank and recorded media like CDs and DVDs.</p>

<p>Items of audio and video equipment covered in chapter 85 may be classified according to:</p>

<ul>
<li>their function</li>
  <li>their design, materials, build and performance</li>
  <li>whether they’ve got more than one function</li>
  <li>whether they’re part of a complete system or an individual separate unit</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-interpretative-rules-for-classification-in-the-uk-trade-tariff">General interpretative rules for classification in the UK Trade Tariff</h2>

<p>The General Interpretative Rules (<abbr title="General Interpretative Rules">GIRs</abbr>) of the Tariff provide the legal basis for classifying goods. There are six <abbr title="General Interpretative Rules">GIRs</abbr>, which are set out in Section I of the second volume of the Tariff.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 1 directs that:</p>

<p>“For legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.”</p>

<p>A heading code is a four digit code, while a chapter code is a two digit code. The terms of the heading descriptions - and the notes to each section and chapter - are paramount when it comes to classifying goods correctly.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 6 determines how goods are classified at the level of a subheading code - a code with six or more digits. So if an item is classified using a code of six or more digits both <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 6 and <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 1 will always apply.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 2, <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3 and <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 4 sometimes also apply depending on the nature of the goods to be classified. It’s important to note that you must consider each <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> in sequence. For example, you can’t use <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3c to classify goods until you have tried using <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 2a, <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 2b, <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3a and <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3b.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 5 applies to certain types of container and to packing materials presented with the items they’re designed to package. </p>

<p>Guidance notes on interpreting each <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> are included in the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (HSENs) to the Tariff.

<h2 id="classifying-television-cameras-video-cameras-and-still-digital-cameras">Classifying television cameras, video cameras and still digital cameras</h2>

<p>Unlike photographic cameras, which are covered in chapter 90, television, video and digital cameras don’t use light-sensitive film or plates. Instead, they form images through a lens and convert them into an electrical signal. This is then transmitted or saved electronically.</p>

<p>Cameras covered in chapter 85 are classified under heading code 8525 and fall into one of three broad categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Television cameras - including webcams. These don’t record or save the image they form, but convert it into an electrical signal that’s transmitted to other apparatus by either line or radio.</li>
  <li>Video cameras and camcorders. These record or save a moving image.</li>
  <li>Digital still cameras. These record or save a still image.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="classifying-parts-and-accessories-for-audio-and-video-equipment">Classifying parts and accessories for audio and video equipment</h2>

<p>Note 2 to Section XVI of the Tariff sets out the legal basis for classifying parts for audio and video equipment.</p>

<p>Many parts and accessories for audio, video, radio, television and non-film camera equipment are classified under heading code 8522 if they’re not part of a complete system.</p>

<p>A part that’s integral to a piece of equipment, but is specifically covered by a heading code in chapter 85 or chapter 84, is classified under that heading code. For example, because coaxial cable is specifically covered by heading code 8544 it’s classified under this heading - and not as a part for audio or video equipment under heading code 8522. However, there are certain heading codes that this rule doesn’t apply to because they’re designated parts headings. They’re listed in Note 2a to Section XVI and are:</p>

  <li>More information about the special heading codes for equipment used in civil aircraft is available in Part 11 of Volume 1 of the Tariff at paragraph 11 2 8 or from the HMRC Tariff Classification Service Enquiry Line on Tel 01702 366 077.</li>
</ol>
<p>Section XVI of the Tariff, which includes chapter 85, has detailed notes covering the goods classified in this chapter - including audio and video equipment. Chapter 85 also includes its own classification notes. When classifying audio or video equipment and parts, you should refer to the notes and decide which, if any, apply.</p>

<h3 id="composite-goods">Composite goods</h3>

<p>Some goods consist of several devices fitted together to form a whole. To correctly classify composite goods like this, try to establish which device performs the main function. Then you can classify the whole item under the heading code for the device that performs this main function.</p>

<p>If it’s not possible to establish which device in a composite item performs the main function, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3c. According to this rule, of all the possible heading or subheading codes that could equally apply, the code that comes last in numerical order is used to classify the goods.</p>

<p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying composite goods.</p>

<h3 id="multifunctional-goods">Multifunctional goods</h3>

<p>Multifunctional goods are items that are designed to perform two or more complementary or alternative functions. For example, a clock radio tells the time and receives radio signals.</p>

<p>To classify a multifunctional item correctly, try to establish its main function. If this is possible, classify the item under the heading or subheading code appropriate to that function as if that were the item’s only function.</p>

<p>If it’s not possible to establish which is the main function, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3c as outlined above.</p>

<p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying multifunctional goods.</p>

<p>Individual components that work together to perform a single function
Some items consist of a series of individual components that are intended to contribute together to a clearly defined function covered by one of the heading codes in chapter 85. The components can be separate or connected by any means like cables or wireless devices.</p>

<p>If an item matches this description, then the whole item is classified under the heading code that’s appropriate to the function it performs.</p>

<p>Note 4 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying single function goods made up of several components.</p>

<h2 id="some-useful-definitions">Some useful definitions</h2>
<p>Definitions of some of the terms used in this guide - and in chapter 85 of the Tariff - are listed below:</p>

<ol>
<li>External power source - a power source like mains electricity that doesn’t come from within an item’s own casing. A vehicle’s battery is an external power source.</li>
  <li>Image size ratio - or “aspect ratio”. The ratio of a television or monitor screen’s image width to its image height. </li>
  <li>Independently powered - see “portable” below. </li>
  <li>Non-film cameras - these are devices like digital cameras that don’t use photographic film or plates to record images. </li>
  <li>Play, player - in this guide, a sound or video player is a device that reproduces recorded or saved sound or video.</li>
  <li>Portable - in this guide, a “portable” electrical appliance is one that can operate without an external power source. It might, for example, be powered by internal batteries, a built-in clockwork generator or an integral solar panel. It might be able to work with an external power source too.</li>
  <li>Radio, radio tuner and radio receiver - these terms are used interchangeably in this guide and refer to a device that can receive radio broadcasts and signals. Note though that a radio tuner might not have a built-in amplifier.</li>
  <li>Video recorder, cassette recorder - common names for devices that can often both record and play back sound or video.</li>
