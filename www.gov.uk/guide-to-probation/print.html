</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Probation means you’re serving your sentence but you’re not in prison.</p>

<p>You could be put on probation because:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re serving a community sentence</li>
  <li>you have been released from prison on licence or on parole</li>
</ul>
<p>While on probation, you may have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>do unpaid work</li>
  <li>complete an education or training course</li>
  <li>get treatment for addictions, like drugs or alcohol</li>
  <li>have regular meetings with an ‘offender manager’</li>
</ul></article><article id="meetings-with-your-offender-manager"><header><h1>Part 2: Meetings with your offender manager</h1>
  </header><p>When you’re on probation you may have meetings with your offender manager. This will usually happen at your local probation office. </p>

<p>At your first meeting your offender manager will explain:</p>

<ul>
<li>the rules of your probation</li>
  <li>the dates, times and places of future meetings</li>
  <li>any appointments you must go to, eg training courses or treatment</li>
  <li>what happens if you don’t do what you are asked</li>
</ul>
<p>Your offender manager will ask you to read and agree to a ‘sentence plan’. This will tell you the rules you have to stick to during your probation and what your responsibilities are.</p>

<h2>What you must tell your offender manager</h2>

<p>You must tell your offender manager if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you plan to change your name or address</li>
  <li>you won’t be able to make any meetings you have arranged with them</li>
  <li>you’re having problems sticking to the rules of your probation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you miss a scheduled meeting with your offender manager, you should get in touch and tell them why. You may need to provide proof, like a letter from a doctor or your employer.</p>

<p>You are allowed to miss meetings or appointments to attend religious or other important events if you give your offender manager advance notice.</p>

</article><article id="if-you-break-the-rules-of-your-probation"><header><h1>Part 3: If you break the rules of your probation</h1>
  </header><p>You could go back to court if you break any rules of your probation. For example, if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>do something your sentence bans you from doing</li>
  <li>commit another crime</li>
  <li>miss meetings and appointments without a good reason</li>
  <li>behave in an aggressive, racist or other unacceptable way at a meeting or appointment</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also be taken back to prison if you break the conditions of your licence or parole.</p>

</article><article id="being-taken-back-to-prison"><header><h1>Part 4: Being taken back to prison</h1>
  </header><p>You can be taken straight back to prison if you have been released on licence or parole and you break any rules. This is known as a ‘recall’. Your offender manager will tell you why you are being recalled.</p>

<p>There are three types of recalls.</p>

<h2>Fixed-term recalls</h2>
<p>With a fixed-term recall, you will go back to prison, be released on probation again after 28 days and you will be on licence until the end of your sentence.</p>

<h2>Standard recalls</h2>
<p>With a standard recall, you will stay in prison until the end of your sentence, unless a Parole Board decides otherwise. Your case will be sent to a Parole Board automatically after 28 days. They will either release you straight away or set a date (within 1 year) when you can be released on licence.</p>

<h2>Extended sentences</h2>
<p>If you’re on an extended sentence, your case will be sent to a Parole Board within 14 days of you going back to prison. They will either release you straight away or set a date (within 1 year) when you can be released on licence.</p>

</article><article id="ask-to-be-released-again-on-probation"><header><h1>Part 5: Ask to be released again on probation</h1>
  </header><p>If you have been taken back to prison and you think you should be released from prison on probation again, you can ask the parole board. This is called ‘making representations’.</p>

<p>You can speak to the parole board yourself, or ask a family member, friend or legal adviser to do it.</p>

<p>You must do this within 2 weeks of being told why you are being recalled to prison.</p>
