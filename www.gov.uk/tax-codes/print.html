  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer or pension provider uses your tax code to work out how much tax to take from your pay or pension. </p>

<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) works out your tax code and sends it to your employer or pension provider.</p>

<p>Usually a tax code is 3 numbers and a letter.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Most people aged under 65 with 1 job have <strong>810L</strong> as their tax code for the 2012 to 2013 tax year.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’ve only got 1 employer or pension, you’ll have 1 tax code. </p>

<p>But if you get income from more than 1 employer or pension provider, each will usually use a different tax code. This is because <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will adjust your tax codes so you:</p>

<ul>
<li>get your tax-free <a href="/income-tax-rates" title="Income Tax rates and allowances">Personal Allowance</a>
</li>
  <li>pay the right amount of tax, spread over a year</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Your tax code doesn’t tell employers or pension providers how much your earn - it only tells them how much tax they need to take from payments they make to you.</p>
</div>

<h2>Where to find your tax code</h2>

<p>You can get your tax code from:</p>

<ul>
<li>payslips from your employer or pension provider</li>
  <li>P45 from an employer if you leave a job</li>
  <li>P60 from your employer at the end of each tax year</li>
  <li>a PAYE Coding Notice - you may get one by post or you can check using <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Self Assessment <a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/self-assessment" title="Self Assessment online">online service</a> if you’re registered</li>

  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The numbers in your tax code tell your employer or pension provider how much tax-free income you get in that tax year.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs works out your tax-free <a href="/income-tax-rates" title="Income Tax rates and allowances">Personal Allowance.</a></p>
</li>

<p>Income that you haven’t paid tax on (eg untaxed interest or part-time earnings) and the value of any <a href="/tax-company-benefits" title="Tax on company benefits">benefits from your job</a> (eg a company car) are added up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The income that you haven’t paid tax on is taken away from your allowances. What’s left is the tax-free income you’re allowed in a tax year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This amount is divided by 10 and added to the <a href="/tax-codes/letters-in-your-tax-code-what-they-mean" title="What the letters in your tax code mean">letter</a> for your circumstances.</p>

<h2>If your tax code has a ‘K’ at the beginning</h2>

<p>Tax codes with ‘K’ at the beginning mean that you have income that isn’t being taxed another way and it’s worth more than your tax-free allowance. For most people, this happens when you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>paying tax you owe from a previous year through your wages or pension</li>
  <li>getting State benefits that you need to pay tax on (like the State Pension)</li>
  <li>getting benefits from work that you must pay tax on (like a company car or health insurance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your employer or pension provider takes the tax due on the income that hasn’t been taxed from your wages or pension - even if another organisation is paying the untaxed income to you.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Employers and pension providers can’t take more than half your pre-tax wages or pension when using a K tax code.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="when-your-tax-code-changes"><header><h1>Part 4: When your tax code changes</h1>
  </header><p>The most common reasons for a tax code change are if you start or stop getting:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/tax-company-benefits" title="Tax on company benefits">benefits from your job</a> that you need to pay tax on</li>
  <li>expenses from work that you can reclaim tax for</li>
  <li>income that isn’t being taxed (like <a href="/rent-room-in-your-home" title="Rent a room in your home">rental income</a>)</li>
  <li>State benefits (including the State Pension) that you need to pay tax on</li>
</ul>
<p>Your tax code will also change if you need to pay tax due from previous years through your wages or pension.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you change jobs, you may be temporarily put on an <a href="/emergency-tax-code" title="Why you're on an emergency tax code">emergency tax code.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>What happens when your tax code changes</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You, your employer or your pension provider tells HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs ">HMRC</abbr>) about the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs ">HMRC</abbr> works out what to do with your tax code (or tax codes if you’ve got more than one).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs ">HMRC</abbr> sends a new tax code to your employer or pension provider. Once they’ve got it, they’ll use it to work out how much tax to take from your payments from the next time they pay you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs ">HMRC</abbr> sends you a ‘PAYE Coding Notice’ which <a href="/tax-codes/what-your-paye-coding-notice-means" title="What your PAYE Notice of Coding means">explains the changes</a></p>
</li>
</ol></article><article id="what-your-paye-coding-notice-means"><header><h1>Part 5: What your PAYE Coding Notice means</h1>
  </header><p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) may send you a PAYE Coding Notice before the beginning of a tax year. </p>

<p>They will send you one if your tax code changes during a tax year.</p>

<p>It tells you what your tax code is and how it’s been worked out. Your employer or pension provider uses the tax code to work out how much tax to take from payments they make to you.</p>

<p>You don’t need to do anything with your PAYE Coding Notice, unless <a href="/reporting-your-tax-code-as-wrong" title="reporting your tax code as wrong">you think it’s wrong</a>. </p>

<h2>What’s on your PAYE Coding Notice</h2>

<p>Along with your tax code, your PAYE Coding Notice shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>allowances that reduce your tax bill</li>
  <li>things that you’ve got to pay tax on through your wages or pension</li>
</ul>
<h3>Positive numbers on your PAYE Coding Notice</h3>

<p>Positive numbers are part of your income that you don’t need to pay tax on. They include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tax-free <a href="/income-tax-rates" title="Income Tax rates and allowances">Personal Allowance</a> you’re entitled to</li>
  <li>
<a href="/married-couples-allowance" title="Married Couple's Allowance">Married Couple’s Allowance</a> if you get it</li>
  <li>expenses repaid by your employer that you can get tax back on</li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative numbers on your PAYE Coding Notice</h3>

<p>Negative numbers are income that you haven’t paid tax on, but the tax will be collected by your employer or pension provider before they pay you.</p>

<p>They include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>benefits from your job that you need to <a href="/tax-company-benefits" title="Tax on company benefits">pay tax on</a>
</li>
  <li>state benefits (including the State Pension) that you’re getting but need to pay tax on</li>
  <li>tax you owe from previous years that you’re paying through your employer or pension provider</li>
</ul>
<h2>What the calculation shows</h2>

<p>The calculation shows how <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> has worked out your tax code.</p>
