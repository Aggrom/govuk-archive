  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Traffic commissioners are responsible for licensing and regulating operators of heavy goods vehicles (<abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicles">HGVs</abbr>), public service vehicles (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicles">PSVs</abbr>) and local bus services. They can also take action against their drivers. </p>

<p>They can call a formal public inquiry in a court to get more evidence to help them decide if they should:</p>

<ul>
<li>grant or refuse licences for <abbr title="Heavy Goods Vehicle">HGV</abbr> or <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> operators</li>
  <li>take action against a vehicle operator, bus service operator or driver of a bus, minibus or lorry</li>
</ul>
<p>This might be if <a href="/traffic-commissioner/objecting-to-a-licence" title="someone has objected to a licence">someone has objected to a licence</a> being granted or the traffic commissioner thinks an operator may have broken the terms of their licence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A vehicle or bus service operator can also request a public inquiry but the traffic commissioner doesn’t have to hold one.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="objecting-to-a-licence"><header><h1>Part 2: Objecting to a licence</h1>
  </header><p>Licence applications are made public. Objections can be made by certain public bodies and in some cases individuals.</p>

<h2>Objections by public bodies</h2>

<p>Bodies can that can object to a licence application include:  </p>

<ul>
<li>local and planning authorities</li>
  <li>the police</li>
  <li>some trade associations and trade unions</li>
</ul>
<h3>When a public body can object</h3>

<p>A public body can object to a licence about the:</p>

<ul>
<li>professional competence of the operator or its transport manager</li>
  <li>operator’s finances </li>
  <li>operator’s reputation or fitness to hold a licence</li>
  <li>operator’s arrangements for vehicle maintenance and drivers’ hours</li>
  <li>operating centre’s environmental standards and general conditions</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Objections must be put in writing to the traffic commissioner within 21 days of a licence application being made public.</p>
</div>

</div>

<h2>Objections by individuals (representations)</h2>
<p>If a vehicle operator wants to add an operating centre to a licence or make changes to an existing centre, owners and residents of land nearby can object. This is called a ‘representation’.</p>

<p>However, representations must be about environmental issues, such as concern over noise, and only if they’re going to affect the owner or resident’s ‘use or enjoyment’ of the land.</p>

<p>Read the VOSA guide for detailed advice about making a representation or complaint.</p>
