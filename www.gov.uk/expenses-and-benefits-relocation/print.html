  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer contributing to an employee’s relocation costs, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>The costs of:</p>

<ul>
<li>buying or selling a home</li>
  <li>moving</li>
  <li>buying certain things for a  new home</li>
  <li>bridging loans</li>
  <li>other relocation costs (these are counted as ‘non-qualifying’ costs and have <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-relocation/what-to-report-and-pay" title="Relocation: reporting expenses and benefits (What to report and pay)">different rules</a>)</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>Up to £8,000, some relocation costs are exempt from reporting and paying tax and National Insurance. These are called ‘qualifying’ costs and include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the costs of buying or selling a home</li>
  <li>moving costs</li>
  <li>buying certain things for a  new home</li>
  <li>bridging loans</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only qualifying costs when:</p>

<ul>
<li>a new employee is moving area to start a job with you</li>
  <li>an existing employee is changing their place of work within your organisation</li>
  <li>the costs are paid before the end of the tax year after the one in which the move took place</li>
  <li>the employee’s new home is reasonably close to the workplace and their old home isn’t</li>
</ul>
<p>For qualifying costs over £8,000, you may have to <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-relocation/what-to-report-and-pay" title="Relocation: reporting expenses and benefits (What to report and pay)">report and pay</a> tax and National Insurance.</p>

<h2>Bridging loans</h2>
<p>For bridging loans to count as qualifying costs:</p>

<ul>
<li>the employee (and/or members of their family) must sell their old home and buy a new one</li>
  <li>they must need a loan to bridge the gap between buying the new house and getting the money from their sale of the old one</li>
  <li>the loan must be used only to buy the new house or pay off loans relating to the old home</li>
  <li>the loan can’t be for more than the market value of the old home at the time the new home is bought</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>For <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-relocation/whats-exempt" title="Relocation: reporting expenses and benefits (What's exempt)">qualifying costs</a> up to £8,000 there is nothing to report and nothing to deduct or pay.</p>
