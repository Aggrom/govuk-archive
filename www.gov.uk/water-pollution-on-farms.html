<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Environment Agency is responsible for managing water resources in England and Wales and for ensuring surface waters and groundwater are protected from activities that could cause pollution. They give guidance on water protection and enforce quality standards.</p>

<p>This guide covers the main issues of water protection and management for farmers, as well as advising on steps you must take to avoid polluting groundwater with sheep dip or other pesticides.</p>

<p>It also gives information on protecting Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (<abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>), reducing diffuse water pollution, avoiding sewage sludge contamination and improving your farm’s overall water efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="groundwater-and-cross-compliance">Groundwater and Cross Compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and other direct payments, eg the Environmental Stewardship scheme, you must meet all relevant Cross Compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions">GAECs</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 2 is the Cross Compliance requirement to protect groundwater by controlling the discharge or disposal of potentially harmful and polluting materials. <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 2 applies to any agricultural business that handles, stores or disposes of listed substances (as currently defined under the 1998 Regulations) including pesticides. </p>

<p>Under the Groundwater Regulations, you must have authorisation from the Environment Agency to dispose of pesticide washings on your land.</p>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 4 is the Cross Compliance requirement concerning <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>, aiming to reduce the pollution of waters caused by nitrates from agricultural sources and to prevent such pollution occurring in the future.</p>

<p>This standard contains requirements around record keeping including keeping a risk map of your holding, spreading requirements, periods when organic manures and manufactured nitrogen fertilisers must not be spread.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on NVZs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 14 is the Cross Compliance requirement to protect hedgerows and watercourses. If you have hedgerows or watercourses on or adjoining your land, you must do everything you reasonably can to keep green cover on land:</p>

<ul>
<li>within two metres of the centre of a hedgerow, watercourse or field ditch</li>
  <li>within one metre of the top of the bank of a watercourse or field ditch</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not cultivate these strips of green cover or apply fertilisers or pesticides to them - although there are certain exceptions to this rule. For more information, you can <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/e2ef65c93d5a9199802573aa0053e7fb/%24FILE/GAEC%2014%202012%20v1.0.pdf">download <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 14 Protection of hedgerows and watercourses from the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website. (PDF, 1.1MB)</a></p>

<p>For information on maintaining green cover next to watercourses, see the guide standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC).</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on Cross Compliance: an overview.</p>

<p>In 2012 a new <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> comes into force which applies some <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> requirements to all land in England, <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 19 - No Spread Zones.</p>

<p>These requirements are aimed at protecting water against pollution and run-off from agricultural sources and oblige claimants to refrain from spreading organic manures and manufactured nitrogen (inorganic) fertilisers within certain distances of watercourses, wells, boreholes and springs. There is also a requirement to produce a risk map of your holding if you spread organic manure.</p>

<p>This standard came into force on 1 January 2012.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/3BF8D731E92BB7E780257968005ED6F7">find information on the requirements of <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 19 - No Spread Zones on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="groundwater-and-the-environmental-permitting-regulations-2010">Groundwater and the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010</h2>

<p>Groundwater is defined as any water below the water table and in direct contact with the ground or soil. Groundwater includes water in:</p>

<ul>
<li>wells</li>
  <li>boreholes</li>
  <li>aquifers</li>
  <li>springs</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> depend on groundwater for drinking and irrigation, so it is very important to protect it from contamination.</p>

<h3 id="discharges-to-groundwater">Discharges to groundwater</h3>

<p>If you discharge any pollutant to groundwater you must have an environmental permit. If you had a groundwater permit or discharge consent, this automatically became an environmental permit on 6 April 2010. You do not need to re-apply under the new regulations.</p>

<p>For some groundwater activities, you may be able to register an exemption with the Environment Agency.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/water/32038.aspx">Find information and guidance on environmental permitting and discharges to groundwater on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h2 id="sheep-dip-contamination">Sheep dip contamination</h2>

<p>Sheep dip can cause a great deal of damage to groundwater, as it is very polluting and generally highly toxic to aquatic life. The active ingredients of sheep dip are classified as List 1 substances under the Groundwater Regulations 1998 (and as hazardous substances under the proposed 2009 Regulations). </p>

<p>The guidance below covers all methods of applying sheep dip - including pour-on products.</p>

<p>You must only use chemicals licensed as sheep dip by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, and all instructions for application must be followed carefully. It is an offence to allow sheep dip to pollute watercourses, drains, sewers, boreholes or soakaways.</p>

<p>It is good practice to only buy enough sheep dip concentrate to meet your immediate needs, as this will reduce storage costs and leakage risks. Unused sheep dip concentrate should always be stored in a secure location on plastic trays. It is particularly important not to leave sheep dip where it could be trampled during use.</p>

<h3 id="dipping-facilities">Dipping facilities</h3>

<p>Your sheep dipping facilities should be sited at least ten metres from a watercourse and no less than 50 metres from a well, spring or borehole.</p>

<p>Sheep dip baths must not have any leaks or drain holes. You should regularly inspect your sheep dip baths, and test them for leaks with water. If necessary, you must repair them before use. Any new sheep dip baths in England and Wales must comply with guidance on their construction, repair and maintenance. You can find out more in chapter 3 of the Groundwater Protection Code.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=2219&amp;id=15589">Download the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs'">Defra</abbr>’s) Groundwater Protection Code on sheep dip compounds from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website. (PDF, 207KB)</a></p>

<p>Where possible, mobile sheep dipping facilities should be used on farmyards with a sealed drainage and collection system. If you have to use a field site for mobile dipping, you must make sure that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose a flat, established grassland or rough grazing site with at least a spade’s depth of topsoil and preferably another 0.5 metres soil depth above rock or thick clay</li>
  <li>do not dip sheep when the site is flooded, waterlogged, frozen or compacted, or when the groundwater level is less than one metre below the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dipping-technique">Dipping technique</h3>

<p>You should mix your sheep dip in a sheep dip bath. Empty sheep dip concentrate containers should be rinsed at least three times and emptied into a sheep dip bath too. You should then crush or make holes in these containers so they can’t be reused.</p>

<p>You should ensure that there is enough room in the sheep dip bath for the sheep to be dipped without the risk of overflowing.</p>

<p>Once the sheep have been dipped, they should be kept in draining-off pens for at least ten minutes. These should have an impermeable base that drains back into the bath.</p>

<p>Ideally, for at least two weeks after dipping, sheep should not be allowed into an area where they can come into contact with a watercourse, eg a stream or field drain. If necessary, you should provide an alternative source of drinking water for your sheep during this period.</p>

<h3 id="dip-disposal-and-storage">Dip disposal and storage</h3>

<p>Waste sheep dip should be disposed of as soon as possible after dipping. For used dip to be safely spread on land, it should be diluted with at least three times the volume of water before spreading.</p>

<p>It is good practice to dispose of waste sheep dip at the same site as the sheep were dipped. However, under the Groundwater Regulations, you must have authorisation from the Environment Agency to dispose of waste sheep dip on land, even in small quantities.</p>

<p>Any spreading must also be limited to once a year for each parcel of land in order to comply with the Landfill Directive.</p>

<p>For further information about obtaining a Groundwater Regulations authorisation, you can contact the Environment Agency helpline on 03708 506 506.</p>

<p>If the conditions are unsuitable for spreading your waste sheep dip and you have to store it, you should use impermeable containers kept in a bund in order to prevent spillage.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=2219&amp;id=15589">Download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs'">Defra</abbr>’s Groundwater Protection Code on sheep dip compounds from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website. (PDF, 207KB)</a></p>

<p>When handling, storing or disposing of sheep dip and dip containers, you have a duty of care to ensure that they are handled safely and according to waste regulations. For more information, read the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview/overview">duty of care - your waste responsibilities.</a></p>

<h2 id="pesticide-contamination-in-surface-waters-and-groundwater">Pesticide contamination in surface waters and groundwater</h2>

<p>Using pesticides carefully and within the law can help protect your farm and the surrounding environment. Proper use will also result in a more effective pest control, helping to save you money.</p>

<p>According to the Control of Pesticides Regulations, a pesticide is defined as any substance, preparation or organism that is prepared for or used to control any pest. Pest control products include:</p>

<ul>
<li>fungicides</li>
  <li>insecticides</li>
  <li>herbicides</li>
  <li>plant growth regulators</li>
  <li>rodenticides (rat and mouse poisons)</li>
  <li>animal and bird repellents</li>
  <li>wood and masonry preservatives</li>
  <li>disinfectants</li>
  <li>anti-fouling products</li>
</ul>
<p>You should keep all pesticides and biocides in a dedicated store of an appropriate size and design. These should be stored in such a way that any spill or leak cannot escape to pollute surface waters or groundwater.</p>

<p>Pesticide stores should be able to hold leaks or spills of up to 110% of the volume in the store. This is done by using a secondary containment system such as a bund. If the store is in a sensitive area, such as a groundwater protection zone or upstream of a water supply, it must be able to hold 185% of the volume. The Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) has produced guidance on how to store pesticides safely.</p>

<h3 id="pesticide-spills">Pesticide spills</h3>

<p>If a spill occurs on your land, you must contain it as much as possible and contact the Environment Agency - Water Pollution hotline on 0800 80 70 60 as soon as you are able. If the spilt pesticides get into a sewer, you must also tell your Statutory Sewerage Undertaker immediately.</p>

<h2 id="sewage-sludge-contamination">Sewage sludge contamination</h2>

<p>Sewage sludge is a by-product of waste water treatment. Using treated sewage sludge (also known as biosolids) on your land can have several potential benefits. These include offering a more efficient and sustainable alternative to inorganic and mineral fertilisers.</p>

<p>Sewage sludge must be stored and applied correctly to prevent soil contamination and surface water pollution from runoff. Plants and crops can uptake heavy metals from the soil, which could contaminate the food chain, and soil organisms can also be affected.</p>

<p>Spreading sewage sludge on farm land is covered by the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989. For more information on these regulations and how they could affect you, see the guide on sewage sludge, slurry and silage.</p>

<p>If sewage sludge gets into a watercourse, you should call the Environment Agency - Water Pollution hotline on 0800 80 70 60 immediately.</p>

(PDF, 135KB)</a></p>

<h2 id="fuel-oil-contamination">Fuel oil contamination</h2>

<p>Fuel oil spills on farms can cause serious water pollution to groundwaters, as well as harming wildlife. If spilt, fuel oil spreads rapidly and widely over the surface of water and is expensive to clean up, so proper storage is vital.</p>

<h3 id="agricultural-fuel-oil-storage">Agricultural fuel oil storage</h3>

<p>Fuel storage tanks should be sited away from any foul or surface-water drains and should be protected from being hit by any vehicles. For fuel deliveries, you should have an operational procedure in place to minimise the chances of a spill and if possible, a member of your farm staff should be present. You must use an automatic fuel shut-off on flexible delivery pipes.</p>

<p>The filling gauge should always be visible for the delivery driver, and care should always be taken not to overfill fuel tanks.</p>

<p>Fuel storage tanks should be bunded to provide secondary containment and to contain any possible leaks or spills. The bund should:</p>

<ul>
<li>not have any outlet or drain for fuel oil to escape</li>
  <li>be of an appropriate size to contain any excess fuel oil</li>
  <li>be waterproof</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use a cover or a roof to protect bunds from rain water.</p>

<p>When not in use, all valves and flexible hoses should be stored inside the bund. It is also recommended that all valves are closed and locked to minimise any risk of theft or vandalism. Valves on fuel lines to equipment such as boilers and grain driers should also be closed and locked when not in use. Tanks, bunds, pipes and equipment should be regularly inspected for damage or corrosion, and maintained when necessary.</p>

<p>Storage tanks should have a 20 year design life with proper maintenance. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>metal tanks can be repainted to prevent corrosion</li>
  <li>mobile tanks should always be transported, placed and used with care, especially when you are refuelling next to surface waters</li>
  <li>the fuel systems and tanks of all tractors and diesel engines used in a fixed position should be regularly checked for leaks - a drip tray can be used as a short-term measure</li>
</ul>
<p>Any water or oil that accumulates in bunds should be removed and disposed of safely. Using a hand pump or an oil absorbent blanket are suitable methods for removing the oil, but oily wastes are classed as hazardous and there are regulations in place on where and how they can be disposed of. For more information, see the guide on hazardous waste: treatment and disposal.</p>

<p>You should have an emergency procedure in place for dealing with an oil spill, with sand and/or other absorbent materials nearby to soak up any spillages. If possible, you should also have a spill kit available at all locations where oil is stored and used. Do not hose down a spillage or use detergent.</p>

<h3 id="legal-requirements-and-regulations">Legal requirements and regulations</h3>

<p>The way agricultural fuel oil can be stored is controlled by law for storage capacities above a certain size. The Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Oil) Regulations apply to new or substantially modified stores that are above ground and have a capacity greater than 1,500 litres. Such stores or areas for storing fuel oil drums must be bunded, to provide secondary containment, and must be located at least ten metres from a ditch or surface water.</p>

<p>You should be able to lock any tank drain valve closed, and there should always be room for a container underneath - eg a bucket. If the inlet of the filling pipe is lower than the highest fuel level in the tank, then an anti-siphon device should also be fitted.</p>

<p>Equipment fuel lines should have hand valves fitted next to the tank, and outlet valves should always be marked to show when they are open and closed.</p>

<p>These regulations do not apply to underground tanks and temporary mobile fuel tanks, or to domestic fuel oil that is stored separately. For guidance on the requirements for underground fuel storage tanks and the design and suitability of storage tanks, you can call the Environment Agency - Water Pollution hotline on 0800 80 70 60.</p>

<p>You can read more about the legal restrictions in the guide on non-hazardous waste: treatment and disposal. This guide also contains advice on dealing with spills and recycling waste fuel oil.</p>

<h2 id="diffuse-water-pollution-and-catchment-sensitive-farming">Diffuse water pollution and Catchment Sensitive Farming</h2>

<p>Agriculture is the single biggest cause of diffuse water pollution. This can be incremental, and can arise from many different sources. These may be small individually, but their collective impact can be damaging.</p>

<p>Agricultural sources of diffuse water pollution include:</p>

<ul>
<li>nutrients from fertilisers and manure</li>
  <li>silt from soil erosion</li>
  <li>pesticides</li>
</ul>
<p>Diffuse water pollution can affect rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwaters, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>damaging the health and diversity of aquatic organisms</li>
  <li>making water unsuitable for drinking, irrigation or recreation</li>
</ul>
<p>The aims of Catchment Sensitive Farming (<abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr>) is to encourage farmers to tackle the causes of diffuse water pollution and to manage land in a way that is sensitive to the ecology of rivers, groundwaters and other aquatic habitats.</p>

<p>Under the Water Framework Directive (<abbr title="Water Framework Directive">WFD</abbr>), all farmers and landowners have a responsibility to manage water use and tackle diffuse pollution.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/planning/40207.aspx">Read about the <abbr title="Water Framework Directive">WFD</abbr> and implications for farmers and agriculture on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<p>You can reduce the amount of diffuse water pollution on your land by:</p>

<ul>
<li>appropriately managing the use of fertilisers, manures and pesticides</li>
  <li>promoting good soil structure and rain infiltration, to avoid runoff and erosion</li>
  <li>protecting watercourses from faecal contamination and sedimentation</li>
  <li>reducing animal stocking density</li>
  <li>managing stock on farms to avoid compaction and poaching of land</li>
  <li>separating clean and dirty water on farms</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information and guidance on reducing diffuse water pollution, see the guide on Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF).</p>

<h2 id="water-efficiency-on-farms">Water efficiency on farms</h2>

<p>By increasing the water efficiency of your agricultural business, you can save money on water costs, as well as reducing your impact on the environment.</p>

<p>A water management plan will help you to reduce the amount of water you are using by:</p>

<ul>
<li>working out your water usage, including which areas of your farm use the most water</li>
  <li>reducing your water use in the most efficient way</li>
</ul>
<p>By getting a better understanding of how you use water on your farm, you can help reduce the risk of water pollution. Using less water will also reduce the amount of dirty water that you will need to treat and dispose of, thus reducing your overall water costs.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has produced a guide which breaks down the implementation of a water management plan into five easy-to-follow steps. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=246307&amp;id=246310">Download the Environment Agency’s guidance on implementing a water management plan from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website. (PDF, 2.26MB)</a></p>

<h2 id="nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Nitrate Vulnerable Zones</h2>

<p>If all, or part, of your farmland is in a <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>, there are special rules you need to follow under the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations to prevent and reduce nitrogen pollution of water from agricultural sources.</p>

<p>The regulations identify all surface waters and groundwaters in England - including coastal waters and estuaries - that are polluted by nitrates. The areas of land which drain into these waters are designated as <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under the Nitrate Pollution Regulations, ‘polluted water’ is defined as water that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>freshwater with a nitrate concentration above a certain level, or the potential to reach that level if preventative action is not taken</li>
  <li>eutrophic, ie enriched by nitrogen compounds causing accelerated algae and other plant growth that’s disturbing the balance for other organisms, or the potential to become eutrophic if preventative action is not taken</li>
</ul>
<p>Eutrophication is a problem because it causes a disturbance to the water’s ecosystem, which in turn can:</p>

<ul>
<li>affect biodiversity, making it an unsuitable habitat for other species</li>
  <li>produce mass vegetation that prevents recreational water use, impacting leisure and tourism</li>
</ul>
<p>If your land has been designated as an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>, you will probably have received a letter from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs'">Defra</abbr>. However, even if you have not received a letter, you still need to check if your farm is in an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/54714.aspx">find information on <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> and recent changes to the <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> rules on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> are also covered under cross compliance. If your land is in an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>, you must meet the standards set by <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 4 in order to qualify for the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> or other direct farm payments.</p>

<p>For more guidance on protecting water from nitrogen pollution in <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>, including further information about <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 4, see the guide on NVZs.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=249953&amp;id=250018">find the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s guidance on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 4 - <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> - on the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website.</a></p>
