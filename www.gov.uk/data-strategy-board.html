<p>On 14 December 2012, Universities and Science Minister David Willetts announced a <a rel="external" href="http://rnn.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Press-Releases/Minister-unveils-1-1-million-Innovation-boost-for-SMEs-684e3.aspx">further investment in open data through an expansion of the Technology Strategy Board’s Innovation Voucher programme</a>. This new development will make <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-strategy-board#faq-innovation-vouchers">Innovation Vouchers</a> available to <abbr title="small to medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr> who want to use open data to help commercialise their ideas and develop new products and prototypes. </p>

<p>The vouchers will form part of the 2 round of the Technology Strategy Board’s Innovation Voucher programme and will compliment the 3 open data investments announced on 12 December.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In December 2012 ministers Matthew Hancock and Francis Maude announced 3 new complementary investments in open data designed to increase the flow of open data and to support companies working to create innovative new products from the re-use of public data. </p>

<p>See the press notice <a rel="external" href="http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-funding-to-accelerate-benefits-of-open-data-684c1.aspx">New funding to accelerate benefits of open data</a>. There will be: </p>

</ul>
<p>All of the measures announced are expected to be in place by early April 2013. </p>

<p>The announcement demonstrates a real commitment from government to open up public data to stimulate economic growth, unlock new commercial opportunities for business and develop more transparent and efficient public services.
