<h2 id="dsb-breakthrough-fund">
<abbr title="Data Strategy Board">DSB</abbr> Breakthrough Fund</h2>

<p>Q. What is the <abbr title="Data Strategy Board">DSB</abbr> Breakthrough Fund?
A. The fund will assist open data proposals where government departments, government agencies and local authorities have identified constraints on data release. It will help the government’s “presumption to publish” agenda.</p>

<p>Q. Who is eligible?
A. Government departments, government agencies and local authorities are eligible to apply. In the case of local authorities, collaborative bids will be encouraged (especially from district councils) based on geographic, economic, community of interest, shared services or other local or regional partnership groupings.</p>

<p>Q. What will the fund cover?
A. The fund will cover a number of sub-themes of activity which could include funding for:</p>

<ul>
<li>IT/tool development</li>
  <li>standardising data</li>
  <li>making data linkable</li>
</ul>
<p>Q. What are the criteria for applications?
A. In order to qualify for funding organisations must:</p>

<ul>
<li>demonstrate that they have not been able to identify appropriate funding through existing budgets</li>
  <li>commit to making the data available for free under the Open Government License, to high quality, with appropriate frequent updates on an ongoing basis</li>
  <li>show that there is a demand for the data to be released / standardised / linked and that there is a longer term economic, social or environmental benefit to making it more accessible</li>
  <li>commit to ways to track the use of their data and the benefit which has been realised from its release</li>
  <li>make the data available through the government’s Data.gov.uk website</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="open-data-immersion-programme-including-competition-prizes">Open Data Immersion programme including competition prizes</h3>

<p>Q. What is the Open Data Immersion Programme?
A. The programme will comprise of a series of events and competitions, run by the Open Data Institute and NESTA (National Endowment for Science Technology &amp; the Arts). It will involve a range of data owners – such as Trading Funds, Departments, agencies and local authorities - and data users.</p>

<p>The events will be aligned to both specific sector challenges and industry themes.</p>

<p>Q. Who is eligible for the programme?
A. The programme will be targeted at small to medium enterprises (<abbr title="small to medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr>) and start-ups. Key participants will be developers who can code the products and services, data owners/domain experts who understand and can help source the appropriate information and product/industry business leaders who have an explicit understanding of the real world industry challenges.</p>

<p>Q. What will participants get from the events?
A. Participants who are selected to partake in an Innovation Camp event will get the opportunity to work closely with data owners/domain experts to help develop their products, and also the chance to partner with other
<abbr title="small to medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr>/start-ups.</p>

<p>The winning projects at each event will be eligible to take their concepts into early product development with pre-seed funding from the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) Innovation Vouchers or competition prizes run by NESTA.</p>

<p>ODI anticipates engaging the private sector to in some way match the commitment of the Data Strategy Board funding. This could be in the form of NESTA prizes, support and or resources to support the winning projects.</p>

<p>Q. Where can I find more information about the Open Data Immersion Programme?
A. More information on the programme will be published shortly on the Open Data Institute website at: www.theodi.org</p>
