  </header><p>If you’re convicted of a motoring offence, the courts can fine you and ‘endorse’ your driving licence with penalty points.</p>

<p>Endorsements must stay on your driving licence for 4 or 11 years depending on the offence.</p>

<p>The endorsement (and penalty points) is put on your driver record and is written on the counterpart document of your photocard driving licence or on your paper driving licence.</p>

<p>If you build up 12 or more penalty points within a period of 3 years, you can be <a href="/driving-disqualifications" title="disqualified from driving">disqualified from driving</a>.</p>

</article><article id="endorsement-codes-and-penalty-points"><header><h1>Part 2: Endorsement codes and penalty points</h1>
  </header><p>Each endorsement has a special code and is given ‘penalty points’ on a scale from 1 to 11. You get more points for more serious offences.</p>

<p>The table shows the offence codes that can be put on your driving licence. It also shows how many penalty points you can get for them. Some offences may also involve a disqualification.</p>

<p>Offence codes and penalty points must stay on your driving licence for 4 or 11 years depending on the offence.</p>
