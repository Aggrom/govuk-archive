<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Reserve Forces and Cadets Division (<abbr title="Reserve Forces and Cadets Division">RF&amp;C</abbr>, formerly known as DRFC) is the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>)’s policy team for Reserve Forces and Cadets.</p>

<p><abbr title="Reserve Forces and Cadets Division">RF&amp;C</abbr>’s mission for the Reserve Forces is to develop, co-ordinate and where appropriate implement the defence policy for Reserve Forces in order to maintain and improve the operational capability of the Armed Forces’ Reserve.</p>

<h2 id="britains-reserve-forces">Britain’s Reserve Forces</h2>

<h3 id="future-reserves-2020-programme">Future Reserves 2020 programme</h3>

<p>On 5 July 2012, the Secretary of State for Defence responded to the ‘Review of the United Kingdom’s Reserve Forces’ published on 18 July 2011. He announced that the government accepts the broad thrust of the Commission’s recommendations, which encompassed the Army Reserves – the largest Reserve component – the Royal Naval and Royal Marines Reserves and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Reserve Forces are an essential and integral component of the UK’s defence capability. </p>

<p>In future they will have a greater role and will be more integrated with the Regular component of the Armed Forces. This requires an increase in size and change in the nature of the Reserve role. This is an essential part of ‘transforming defence’ and delivering defence’s vision for Future Force 2020. </p>

<p>An additional £1.8 billion is being invested over in the Reserve Forces the next 10 years. The trained strength of the Reserves of all 3 Services will grow by 50% or more by 2018 to 30,000 in the Territorial component of the Army Reserve, 3,100 in the Royal Navy and Royal Marine Reserves and 1,800 in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.</p>

<p>Future Reserve Forces 2020 (FR20) is a programme about increasing the size and role of the Reserves and not about producing direct efficiency savings. FR20 will, however, play an important role in achieving the redesign of the Army required by Army 2020, which will consist of 82,000 regulars and an expanded volunteer Army Reserve of 30,000.</p>

<h2 id="future-reserves-2020-consultation-exercise">Future Reserves 2020 consultation exercise</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is conducting a formal public consultation on how to achieve our vision for the FR20. The Secretary of State for Defence requested this consultation in response to the review of the UK’s Reserve Forces. </p>

<p>The UK’s Reserve Forces are a vital component of our Armed Forces, contributing to the public good that is defence. They have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the nation’s defence and security. </p>

<p>Our Reserve Forces are currently structured for the security challenges of the past, but in the future the UK will face different challenges. Over the next decade, as defence transforms to meet future and uncertain challenges, so the importance of our Reserve Forces will increase, and the way we organise and use them will change.</p>

<p>The consultation exercise will consider what changes are required to the Reserve Forces in order to generate and sustain the numbers and capabilities we need from them to meet our defence requirements. </p>

<p>Specifically, we will look to define the right offer to attract and retain the individuals we need to serve in the reserves; the right relationship with the civilian employers of reservists; and the right support for reservists and their families across our communities.</p>

<p>The Consultation (Green) Paper sets out our thinking and direction of travel on FR20. The main areas include:</p>

<ul>
<li>how we will use Reserve Forces in the future</li>
  <li>the offer for employers</li>
  <li>the offer for reservists</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to engage and provide feedback as this is your opportunity to influence the future look and make-up of the Reserve Force.</p>

<p>A White Paper in 2013 will detail the policy changes for Reserves and show how changes will be implemented to create a new force structure. Responses received during the consultation exercise will be used to inform the White Paper.</p>

<h2 id="join-the-reserves">Join the Reserves</h2>

<p>All types of people are putting their spare time to better use as reservists in the Armed Forces. Being a reservist is as rewarding as it is challenging. You’ll be integrated into our regular forces, doing things you never pictured yourself doing, learning new skills and meeting people who, like you, want more from life.</p>

The kind of individuals required to operate successfully in these circumstances are not found in abundance. The selection process for entry into <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr> seeks to identify the qualities and potential of those suitable for service within <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr> accepts male volunteers who have no previous military service aged 18 to 32 or male volunteers who have had previous military service with any part of the Regular or Reserve Armed Forces (Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army, and Royal Air Force) up to the age of 34. Volunteers must be able to commit to considerable training demands and willing to deploy overseas.</p>

Females are not allowed to serve with tactical subunits. Appointments do exist in administrative roles and as Special Forces Communicators.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-uksfr-selection">What is <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr> selection?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr> Selection Course is tried and tested, the course is run twice per year. It is both physically and mentally demanding and is broken down into 2 main components:</p>

<h3 id="aptitude">Aptitude</h3>

<p>Aptitude is a progressively arduous phase, requiring greater expenditure of physical energy, designed to select volunteers with the right qualities. It is emphasized to stand any chance of success you must be physically fit at the start of the course. The qualities required are:</p>

<ul>
<li>physical and mentally robust. </li>
  <li>self confident. </li>
  <li>self disciplined </li>
  <li>able to work alone</li>
  <li>able to assimilate information and new skills</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="continuation">Continuation</h3>

<p>On passing aptitude you will undertake continuation training which is an intensive period of instruction and assessment on Special Forces tactics, techniques and procedures, including weapons and standard operating procedures (SOP’s). This is progressive with the emphasis on individuals assimilating new skills while under physical and mental pressure. At the end of the continuation you will be trained to an operationally deployable status.</p>

<h3 id="progressive-training">Progressive training</h3>

<p>Within 12 months of completing selection candidates will enter a period of probation which will require the completion of a basic parachute course and a communication course. On completion of these courses and the probation period candidates will be eligible for mobilization. Throughout your career training and skill development will be continuous as soldiers are required to maintain a high level of proficiency in a diverse range of skills.</p>

<h3 id="commitment">Commitment</h3>

<p>You will require a very high level of commitment as both aptitude and continuation are conducted over a set number of weekends and periods of continuous training totalling approximately 80 days over a 12 month period. Such commitment is dependant on the support of your employer and family.</p>

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr> provides an opportunity for soldiers to work within a unique, independent organization which takes pride in its heritage, role and professionalism. Service is physically and intellectually challenging, but the rewards are significant.</p>

<p>In addition to a strong sense of purpose in embracing the challenges of a complex world, UKSF (R) provides challenge and adventure with the additional benefit of Special Forces pay rates. It also provides an excellent grounding for those who aspire to serve with the Regular UKSF units.</p>

A member of the recruiting staff will then reply.</p>

<p>We look forward to you accepting this challenge and coming forward.</p>

<h2 id="physical-standards-needed-to-be-a-reservist">Physical standards needed to be a reservist</h2>

<p>A brief outline of the physical standards required on the initial phases of induction and aptitude</p>

<h3 id="fitness-required">Fitness required</h3>

<p>There is little doubt that the fitness you require to successfully pass aptitude is much higher than that normally required through the remainder of the Armed Forces. Amongst the many myths that surround <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr>, one of the most flawed in that <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr> are manned entirely by a particular brand of individual, capable of “superhuman” feats of endurance. Many individuals mistakenly believe that the level of fitness required is far beyond their capability.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-get-yourself-fit">How do you get yourself fit?</h3>

<p>So how does a civilian with no previous experience, soldier, sailor or airman and more to the point, how do you get yourself fit enough to pass the course? When should you start?  What training regime will best suit you and how hard should you train?</p>

<p>These questions are familiar to those that have previously attended selection and it’s a fair bet that each one would answer differently. Why? Well, it’s because of the human factor. It’s because we are all different and everyone begins his training for selection from a different start point and level of fitness. Everyone has very different levels of response to training and the gains each will achieve from whatever training regime embarked upon.</p>

<h3 id="induction-periods">Induction periods</h3>

<p>During the Recruit Selection and Induction process volunteers will be required to complete a risk reduction run and a number of other physical selection standards such as dynamic and static lifts, sit ups, press ups and a load carrying exercise (jerry can carry) to determine the volunteers physical fitness status. The risk reduction run is a 1.5 mile (2.4 km), carried out in running equipment and should be completed in 9.5 to 10.5 minutes. Volunteers will be given further advice on individual training programmes. As time is of the essence responsibility for physical development rests with the individual.</p>

<h3 id="build-up-phase">Build-up phase</h3>

<p>The weekend training periods of aptitude are devoted to physical training, loaded marches and progressive navigation exercises. There is no pass or fail criteria during this period with the exception of the Basic Combat Fitness Test-Infantry (BCFT-I), and a 24 kilometer loaded march which you must successfully complete in the time set to be allowed to continue. This demonstrates a level of fitness that you must possess to have a realistic chance of success and is a safety requirement that must be passed before allowing you to march individually on the hills.</p>

<p>The final week ‘Test Week’ by virtue on its name, is the crux of the aptitude phase, and a pass or fail criteria is rigorously implemented. Although the ‘Threshold Test’, the BCFT(I) is the minimum requirement to start the aptitude phase and is conducted on weekend 1, it gives you little indication of what is to come. It would be foolhardy not to take your preparation beyond this elementary requirement.</p>

<h3 id="threshold-test">Threshold test</h3>

<p>An 8-mile march with equipment and weapon, should pose no problem for you, least of all if you are contemplating service with <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr>. Almost all of the personnel failing at this early stage generally appear not to have considered marching speed, carrying a load and wearing combat boots. </p>

<p>Your level of fitness will count for nothing if your equipment is poorly fitted, your boots uncomfortable and if you are unaccustomed to carrying a bergan at a brisk marching pace. Poor preparation at this stage inevitably results in muscle injuries, painful blisters and bergan burns (caused by friction), all of which will impede or prevent your subsequent progress on the course. Those with no previous military experience need not be concerned at this time as you will receive training and instruction on clothing and equipment.</p>

<h3 id="loaded-march">Loaded march</h3>

<p>Is the traverse of a relatively high (in excess of 600-metres above sea level!) mountain feature. The march is pace led by Directing Staff (DS) and the time allowed to complete depends upon the weather conditions. If you maintain the pace set by the DS, navigation will not be an issue. You will however, have to be capable of sustaining a brisk pace.</p>

<p>As a guide, you will be expected to march a distance of 24 km in roughly 4 hours carrying a rifle and equipment weighing 20kg. Food and water are always in addition to this. Once again we find that many volunteers underestimate this stage. Good preparation guarantees success, as it does with the remainder of selection.</p>

<h3 id="swimming-test">Swimming test</h3>

<p>This will be conducted between the first and third aptitude weekend. You should be aware that swimming is an essential skill for the Special Forces soldier, who will often be required to swim confidently in deep open water and arrive at the destination ready to conduct operations. The <abbr title="United Kingdom Special Forces (Reserves)">UKSF(R)</abbr> swimming test is mandatory and reflects the basic patrol requirements that must be successfully completed. This is conducted in the swimming pool and calls for:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 10-metre “high” water entry followed by</li>
  <li>9 minutes treading water followed by</li>
  <li>a 500-metre swim wearing uniform using crawl or breast stroke</li>
  <li>a 10-metre underwater swim and</li>
  <li>the retrieval of a submerged object</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard is not unobtainable and the test should prove to be no problems for you when you come on selection. Unfortunately, some hopeful and extremely fit volunteers fail at this stage. By following the advice in the suggested swimming training programmes you should commence selection at a level of swimming proficiency far beyond the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>During ‘Test Week’ you will conduct a series of navigational exercises, over arduous terrain with the distances and equipment you carry increasing in weight over the course of the week. The various routes will take you over harsh, mountainous terrain and the daily distance will increase to 64 km on the final exercise. We are looking to see if you have the necessary resolve to push yourself. It will require huge amounts of determination and stamina, fighting against both the clock and the elements. Your progress will be carefully monitored and you must achieve the minimum time specified by the Directing Staff.</p>

<p>We do not support or recommend commercial physical development programmes or literature. Our advice is to attend the briefing day and be briefed by those that have passed the course, hear how they achieved it, what training programme suited them and what time frame is required. Based on this advice you will be better prepared and at the correct level of fitness to progress through the course.</p>

<p>We are not permitted to publish a full training programme however this will be made available on the Briefing and Induction day.</p>

<h2 id="future-management-of-seriously-injured-reserves">Future Management of seriously injured Reserves</h2>

<p>Non-mobilised reservists that are seriously injured whilst on duty will receive the most appropriate clinical care, this might now include facilities available through the Defence Medical Services.</p>

<p>Changes to the management of seriously injured Reserve Forces personnel have been implemented to ensure that the appropriate care is provided following a recent policy review. Mobilised Reservists are already eligible for the full range of Defence Medical Services (<abbr title="Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr>) healthcare. All Reservists while on duty (whether mobilised or not) are eligible for emergency treatment from the <abbr title="Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr> healthcare within the current structures of both <abbr title="Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr> and NHS and non-mobilised casualties requiring further treatment in the UK will transfer to NHS care.</p>

<p>Reservists who are not mobilised and have suffered a relatively serious injury during training, will receive the same healthcare, through <abbr title="Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr> or NHS, as mobilised Reservists and their Regular counterparts.</p>

<p>Reservists are eligible to access treatment in <abbr title="Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr> facilities if they are seriously injured while serving on duty, including conducting military training or other duties under the Reserve Forces Act 1996.</p>
