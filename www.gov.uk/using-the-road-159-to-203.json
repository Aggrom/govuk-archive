For the precise wording of the law, please refer to the various Acts and Regulations (as amended) indicated in the Code. Abbreviations are listed on the following page.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the provisions apply on all roads throughout Great Britain, although there are some exceptions. The definition of a road in England and Wales is \u2018any highway and any other road to which the public has access and includes bridges over which a road passes\u2019 (RTA 1988 sect 192(1)). In Scotland, there is a similar definition which is extended to include any way over which the public have a right of passage (R(S)A 1984 sect 151(1)).   </p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that references to \u2018road\u2019 therefore generally include footpaths, bridleways and cycle tracks, and many roadways and driveways on private land (including many car parks). In most cases, the law will apply to them and there may be additional rules for particular paths or ways. Some serious driving offences, including drink-driving offences, also apply to all public places, for example public car parks.</p>\n\n<p>Chronically Sick &amp; Disabled Persons Act 1970   CSDPA</p>\n\n<p>Functions of Traffic Wardens Order 1970    FTWO</p>\n\n<p>Greater London (General Powers) Act 1974    GL(GP)A</p>\n\n<p>Highway Act 1835 or 1980 (as indicated)   HA</p>\n\n<p>Horses (Protective Headgear for Young Riders) Act 1990    H(PHYR)A</p>\n\n<p>Horses (Protective Headgear for Young Riders) Regulations 1992 H(PHYR)R</p>\n\n<p>Motor Cycles (Eye Protectors) Regulations 1999    MC(EP)R</p>\n\n<p>Motor Cycles (Protective Helmets) Regulations 1998        MC(PH)R</p>\n\n<p>Motorways Traffic (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 1982    MT(E&amp;W)R</p>\n\n<p>Motorways Traffic (England &amp; Wales) Amended Regulations    MT(E&amp;W)(A)R</p>\n\n<p>Motorways Traffic (Scotland) Regulations 1995            MT(S)R</p>\n\n<p>Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999        MV(DL)R</p>\n\n<p>Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts) Regulations 1993    MV(WSB)R</p>\n\n<p>Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts) (Amendment) Regulations 2006                        MV(WSB)(A)R</p>\n\n<p>Motor Vehicles (Wearing of Seat Belts by Children in Front Seats) Regulations 1993            MV(WSBCFS)R</p>\n\n<p>New Roads and Streetworks Act 1991                NRSWA</p>\n\n<p>Pedal Cycles (Construction &amp; Use) Regulations 1983        PCUR</p>\n\n<p>Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000        PCC(S)A</p>\n\n<p>Police Reform Act 2002                        PRA</p>\n\n<p>Prohibition of Smoking in Certain Premises (Scotland)\n    Regulations 2006.
