<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are extensive trade and financial sanctions in place against Iran as a result of the UK’s foreign policy commitments and the imposition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and United Nations (<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>) sanctions and embargoes. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>an arms embargo and a prohibition on the supply of equipment that could be used for human rights abuses</li>
  <li>prohibitions on the sale, supply, transfer, import, transport or export of dual-use goods and technology</li>
  <li>prohibitions on the provision of brokering services and technical and financial assistance related to any goods and technology whose supply is prohibited; prohibitions on investment in Iranian entities engaged in manufacturing those items</li>
  <li>prohibitions on the sale, supply, transfer or export of key equipment and technology for the oil and gas industry (with a limited exemption for transactions required by, or obligations arising from, contracts that were in place before 27 October 2010). There are also specific exemptions on transactions for key equipment and technology for the petrochemical industry required by contracts which were in place before 23 January 2012</li>
  <li>prohibitions on investment in Iranian entities or bodies engaged in the exploration or production of crude oil and natural gas, the refining of fuels or the liquefaction of natural gas</li>
  <li>prohibitions on any new investment in the petrochemical sector in Iran or in Iranian or Iranian-owned enterprises engaged in that industry outside Iran</li>
  <li>prohibitions on the sale, supply, transfer or export to, and the purchase, import or transfer from Iran of gold, precious metals and diamonds. Also, the sale, supply, transfer or export of unissued or newly minted Iranian bank notes and coins to or for the benefit of the Central Bank of Iran</li>
  <li>asset freezes against listed individuals and entities and a prohibition of making economic resources available to them (including by the supply of goods and services which may be used to obtain funds)</li>
  <li>restrictions on transfers of funds to and from Iran, and restrictions on Iran’s access to the insurance and bond markets</li>
  <li>restrictions on providing certain services on Iranian ships and cargo aircraft</li>
  <li>prohibitions on the import, purchase or transport to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states from Iran of crude oil or petroleum products</li>
</ul>
<p>The restrictive measures apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>to acts carried out within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and to the activities of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> entities and nationals overseas</li>
  <li>to the supply of goods and services directly or indirectly to Iran and to Iranian-owned or controlled entities or bodies outside Iran</li>
</ul>
<p>The UK government does not encourage trade with, or investment in, Iran and has withdrawn all commercial support for trade. If you decide to trade with Iran, you do so at your own risk. Having weighed up the risks, the final decision on whether to trade with Iran lies with you. However, if your business dealings get into trouble, the government will not be able to assist.</p>

<p>This guide outlines relevant information about the restrictions on the supply of goods and related services to Iran only.</p>

<p>For information on financial sanctions, please refer to the HM Treasury website and for information on the restrictions on Iranian ships and cargo aircraft please contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). For restrictions on imports from Iran, please refer to the Import Licensing Branch (<abbr title="Import Licensing Branch">ILB</abbr>) part of the Department for Businss, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>).</p>

It replaces Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 961/2010.  <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:088:0001:0112:EN:PDF">Download the full text of  Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 267/2012 from the Europa website (PDF, 1.96MB).</a></p>

<p>Goods whose supply is prohibited for human rights reasons (including equipment and technology which may be used for the monitoring or interception of the internet and telecommunications and related services) are listed in Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 359/2011. </p>

<p>The Regulation contains a range of measures, including those detailed in the Annexes specified below.</p>

<h3 id="items-banned-for-export">Items banned for export</h3>

<p>Prohibitions are in place on items listed in Annexes I, II of the Regulation. This concerns the:</p>

<ul>
<li>sale, supply, transfer or export to Iran or to an Iranian entity or body outside Iran of listed dual-use goods and technology</li>
  <li>provision of brokering services, and the provision of technical and financial assistance, related to the listed goods and technology</li>
  <li>purchase, import or transport from Iran of listed items</li>
  <li>investment in and financing of any Iranian person, entity or body engaged in the manufacture of listed items</li>
</ul>
<p>Annex I is identical to Annex I of the Council Regulation 428/2009 (otherwise known as the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List). This is with the exception of certain items listed in Category 5 (telecommunications and information security) which are not subject to the prohibition.  The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> will continue to process licence applications for these Category 5 items in the usual way.</p>

<p>For more details about Council Regulation 428/2009, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/controls-on-dual-use-goods">Controls on Dual-Use Goods</a>. The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List forms part of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists.

<p>Annex II is a list of additional dual-use items with significant potential utility to Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</p>

<h3 id="licensable-items">Licensable items</h3>

<p>Annex III is a further list of dual-use items which may have utility to Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. </p>

<ul>
<li>A licence is required for the sale, supply, transfer or export to Iran or to an Iranian entity or body outside Iran of goods and technology listed in Annex IV</li>
  <li>A licence is required for the provison of brokering services, of technical or financial assistance related to those items, or for investment in Iranian entities engaged in manufacturing those items</li>
</ul>
<p>In line with the Written Minisiterial Statement issued on 9 November 2010 by Mark Prisk, Minister of State for Business and Enterprise, a licence for Annex III (previously Annex IV of Council Regulation 961/2010) items will only be issued in exceptional circumstances - such as for humanitarian end-use - where there is manifestly no risk to diversion to Iran’s nuclear activities. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/notices-to-exporters/2010/nte201040.doc">Download Notice to Exporters 2010/40 about change to licensing policy of Annex IV (now Annex III) listed items published on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (DOC, 492K).</a> </p>

<h3 id="oil--gas-restrictions">Oil &amp; Gas Restrictions </h3>

<p>Annex IV relates to the prohibitions of import, purchase or transport to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States from Iran of crude oil or petroleum products.</p>

<p>Annex V lists petrochemical products which are banned from import into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> if they originate in Iran or have been exported from Iran.</p>

<p>Annex VI ilists key equipment and technology for the oil and gas industry in Iran, the export or supply of which is prohibited. This includes equipment and technology for:</p>

<ul>
<li>the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas</li>
  <li>refining of crude oil and liquefaction of natural gas</li>
  <li>the petrochemical industry </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-measures">Other measures</h3>

<p>Annex VII is a listing of gold, precious metals and diamonds.</p>

<p>Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 267/2012 also specifies in Article 16 a prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly of newly printed or unissued Iranian denominated banknotes and minted coinage, to, or for the benefit of the Central Bank of Iran.</p>

<h2 id="restrictions-on-items-that-could-be-used-for-internal-repression-in-iran">Restrictions on items that could be used for internal repression in Iran</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> sanctions on Iran include human rights measures. These were originally adopted in Council Decision 2011/235/CFSP and implemented in Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 359/2011 on 12 April 2011.</p>

<p>Following a review, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Council have renewed the Decision for a further year and also made a number of amendments which were adopted in Council Decision 2012/168/CFSP and Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 264/2012. (which amends Regulation 359/2011). The Decision came into force on 23 March 2012 and the Regulation came into force on 24 March 2012.</p>

<h3 id="items-banned-for-export-1">Items banned for export</h3>

<p>Prohibitions are on place on items listed in Annex III of the Regulation 359/2011 (as amended by Regulation 264/2012):</p>

<ul>
<li>the sale, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly of equipment which might be used for internal repression to any person, entity or body in Iran or for use in Iran</li>
  <li>the provision (direct or indirect) of technical assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance related to the above equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the above listed provisions were previously contained in Annex III in Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 961/2010 which has now been repealed and replaced by Council Regulation No 267/2012. </p>

<h3 id="licensable-items-1">Licensable Items</h3>

<p>Annex IV is a of equipment, technology or software which may be used for monitoring or interception or telecommunications. A prior authorisation (licence) shall be required:</p>

<ul>
<li>to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly items as listed in Annex IV to any person, entity or body in Iran or for use in Iran</li>
  <li>for the provision of technical assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance related to the items listed in Annex IV to any person, entity or body in Iran or for use in Iran</li>
  <li>for the provision of telecommunication or internet monitoring or interception services of any kind to or for the direct or indirect benefit of Iran’s government, public bodies, corporations and agencies or any person or entity acting on their behalf or at their direction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="restrictions-on-exporting-to-or-financing-irans-oil-and-gas-industry">Restrictions on exporting to or financing Iran’s oil and gas industry</h2>

<p>If you are intending to export any items which are listed on Annex VI of Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 267/2012 or to provide brokering services or technical or financial assistance related to those items, you are advised to read this section carefully.</p>

<p>As of 27 October 2010, a range of restrictive measures which apply in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on exports to Iran’s oil and gas industry came into effect. These measures were updated on 23 March 2012. The measures target the industry in Iran and Iranian enterprises engaged in those activities outside Iran. The measures could apply to your business if you trade with Iran, or intend to trade in goods or technology relating to:</p>

<ul>
<li>exploration of crude oil and natural gas</li>
  <li>production of crude oil and natural gas</li>
  <li>refining of crude oil</li>
  <li>liquefaction of natural gas</li>
  <li>petrochemical industry</li>
</ul>
<p> In particular Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 267/2012, imposes a prohibition on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the sale, supply, transfer or export of key equipment and technology for the oil and gas industry as listed in Annex VI of the Regulation</li>
  <li>the provision of brokering services and of technical and financial assistance related to those goods and technology</li>
  <li>investment (including the granting of any loan or credit facility, the acquisition or extension of a participation and the creation of a joint venture) in any Iranian person, entity or body engaged in the exploration or production of crude oil and natural gas, the refining of fuels or the liquefaction of natural gas and petrochemicals</li>
</ul>
<p>To gain a fuller understanding, you are advised to <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:088:0001:0112:EN:PDF">download the full text of Council Regulation (No 267/2012 from the Europa website (PDF, 1.98MB)</a>.</p>

<p>You should refer to Annex VI in Council Regulation No 267/2012 before you directly or indirectly sell, supply, transfer or export any item from the extensive listing to any Iranian person, entity or body or for use in Iran. </p>

<h3 id="contractual-exemption">Contractual exemption</h3>

<p>There are specific exemptions from the restrictions on the Iranian oil and gas industry where the supply of goods and services is required by:</p>

<ul>
<li>a trade contract that was in force on or before the 26 October 2010, or is an obligation arising from such a contract.</li>
  <li>in the case of an investment, the contract must have been in place before 26 July 2010.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are additional exemptions for the sale, supply, transfer or export of key equipment and technology for the petrochemical industry provided contracts have been concluded before 23 January 2012.</p>

<p>In order to benefit from these exemptions you must notify the details of the proposed transaction to the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> at least 20 working days in advance. The notification must include sufficient details of the relevant contract and the associated transaction(s) to confirm that the exemption does indeed apply.</p>

<p>The completed form should be emailed to <a href="mailto:eco.oil&amp;gasnotifications@bis.gsi.gov.uk">eco.oil&amp;gasnotifications@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a> </p>

<p>If the goods and technology you intend to export are not listed on either Annex VI, there is no prohibition on their export under the oil and gas or petrochemcial provisions. However, you will need to check that the items are not controlled or prohibited under any other provision, such as the prohibition on the supply of dual-use goods. You should also check that the entity you are supplying is not subject to asset freeze provisions. </p>

<h3 id="fiscal-restrictions">Fiscal restrictions</h3>

<p>In addition to a range of measures to freeze funds and economic resources,  restrictions also apply to the financing of any of the prohibited activities relating to the exploration of crude oil and natural gas, production of crude oil and natural gas, refining, or liquefaction of natural gas, whether by an Iranian person, entity or body.</p>

<p>‘Financing’ includes investment, loans or the extension of credit.</p>

<p>For further information on financial restrictions, find <a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/fin_sanctions_index.htm">out about the Asset Freezing Unit on the HM Treasury website</a><a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/council_regulation_eu_961_251010.pdf">.</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-claim-a-contractual-exemption-for-specific-items-exported-to-iran">How to claim a contractual exemption for specific items exported to Iran</h2>

<h3 id="are-the-items-listed-in-annex-vi">Are the items listed in Annex VI?</h3>

<p>The first question to address in determining whether you can claim a contractual exemption is whether the items that you intend to supply, or for which you intend to provide technical or financial assistance, are listed in Annex VI of Council Regulation 267/2012. <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:088:0001:0112:EN:PDF">Download the full text of Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 267/2012 from the Europa website (PDF, 1.98MB).</a> </p>

<p>In most cases, you should be able to determine this yourself, but if you have tried this and really cannot do so, you can get advice from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s Control List Classification Advice Service.  </p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login">Apply for Control List Classification Service advice on the SPIRE website with the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>.</a> </p>

<p>Please be aware that the Control List Classification Advice Service can only advise whether or not goods or technology are listed in the Annexes to the Regulation. It cannot advise whether or not the contractual exemption applies to a specific transaction.  For guidance on how to determine whether the contractual exemption applies, see ‘Exemption’ below.</p>

<p>If the equipment does not feature on Annex VI, there is no bar to exporting or providing assistance under the oil and gas provisions, but you will need to consider further aspects before your export can proceed.  These are set out below.</p>

<p>If the equipment does feature on Annex VI, then you may be able to claim exemption from the prohibition - and thus proceed with the transaction - if you have a qualifying contract.</p>

<h3 id="exemption">Exemption</h3>

<p>The prohibitions do not apply to:</p>

<ul>
<li>transactions required by a trade contract concerning key equipment or technology in the exploration of crude oil and natural gas, production of crude oil and natural gas, refining, liquefaction of natural gas (listed in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex VI) concluded before 27 October 2010.</li>
  <li>ancillary contracts necessary for executing such oil and gas contracts or by a contract or agreement concluded before 26 July 2010  and relating to an investment in Iran made before 26 July 2010. </li>
  <li>transactions required by a contract contract concerning key equipment or technology for the petrochemical industry (listed in Part 3 of Annex VI) concluded before 24 March 2012</li>
  <li>ancillary contracts necessary for the execution of such petrochemical contracts or by a contract or agreement concluded before 23 January 2012 and relating to an investment in Iran made before 23 January 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case you also need to notify the relevant competent authority of such transactions at least 20 working days in advance. The UK competent authority is the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="notification-how-to-claim-the-contractual-exemption">Notification: how to claim the contractual exemption</h3>

<p>If you wish to supply equipment or technology or related assistance listed in Annex VI to Iran or to an Iranian entity you will therefore need to demonstrate that such a contract exists by notifying the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. The purpose of the notification is intended to give <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> the opportunity to consider and confirm whether the contract qualifies for the exemption - otherwise, the transaction will remain prohibited.</p>

<p>To claim the exemption, you will need to prove a number of key facts - chiefly that the obligation to supply the equipment or technology, or to provide related assistance or brokering services, arises from a contract that was in force on or before 27 October 2010 (for specified oil and gas equipment) and on or before 24 March 2012 (for specified petrochemical equipment).</p>

<p>The notification should be submitted to <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> at least 20 working days in advance of the date of transaction via email along with a copy or key excerpts of the relevant contract.  <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/forms/iran-sanctions-oilgas-form.doc%20">Download the Notification for Iran Oil &amp; Gas Contractual Exemption Form from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (DOC, 72K).</a></p>

<p>This form and any associated attachments should be sent to: <a href="mailto:eco.oil&amp;gasnotifications@bis.gsi.gov.uk">eco.oil&amp;gasnotifications@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Notifications received will be confirmed by receipt and a response authorising qualifying contracts, or confirming that your contract does not qualify, will be sent within 20 working days.</p>

<h3 id="what-sort-of-contracts-can-qualify">What sort of ‘contracts’ can qualify?</h3>

<p>Whilst a contract is no more than a binding agreement between two parties to provide goods or services for a consideration, for the purposes of the application of the exemption it will be necessary to provide robust evidence that it exists. Therefore, the contractual obligations must be clearly documented, and copies of such documents will need to be included with the notification to <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. Relevant contracts can come in many different forms including a ‘purchase order’ or invoice but must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be in written form (verbal contracts will not qualify)</li>
  <li>include consignor, consignee and customer / end-user details as appropriate</li>
  <li>have a date of issue</li>
  <li>provide details of the transaction including the equipment or technology, or technical or financial assistance, to be provided</li>
</ul>
<p>For more insight into when a contractual exemption might apply or not, see the page in this guide concerning frequently asked questions about sanctions on Iran.</p>

<p>You should be mindful that <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> is the point to which contracts for which exemption is to be claimed are notified, along with satisfactory supporting evidence. <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> then examines the claim, gives a view on whether, on the evidence provided, your contract qualifies and notifies you of that view. The prime responsibility however, lies with you to determine whether a claim for exemption is warranted before contacting the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. If you are unsure whether or not you have a qualifying contract you should seek your own legal advice. </p>

<h3 id="if-my-contract-is-approved-does-that-give-me-the-right-to-complete-the-transaction">If my contract is approved, does that give me the right to complete the transaction?</h3>

<p>Not necessarily.  If you know, have reason to suspect, or have been informed by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> that what you intend to supply might contribute to Iran’s WMD programme, then you will need to apply for an export licence from <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.  Such a licence may be refused regardless of whether you have a qualifying contract. For more details see the associated guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/beginners-guide-to-export-controls">End-Use Controls</a>.</p>

<p>Any supply to an Iranian person or entity listed in Annexes VIII or IX of the Regulation is also prohibited, because that would represent the provision of economic resources to one of those entities and this is prohibited under the financial sanctions against Iran for which HM Treasury is the competent authority.</p>

<h3 id="submitted-export-licence-applications">Submitted export licence applications</h3>

<p>The oil and gas restrictions are not a licensing regime.  The export of these goods is prohibited and you should not submit export licence applications for items listed in Annex VI. </p>

<p>However, if, for other reasons, you have already submitted a licence application that includes items listed in Annex VI, you will be advised that the export of those items is prohibited unless you can demonstrate contractual exemption. Please refer to the notification section above.  </p>

<h2 id="restrictions-on-arms-exports-and-end-use-controls-on-iran">Restrictions on arms exports and end-use controls on Iran</h2>

<h3 id="arms-embargo">Arms embargo</h3>

<p>There is an arms embargo imposed against Iran.</p>

<p>This embargo is a ban on the export or supply of ‘arms and related material’ (ie military weapons, ammunition and equipment). The UK interprets the arms embargo on Iran as covering all goods and items on the UK Military List (which forms a part of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists). For more information see the guide on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">UK Strategic Export Control Lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items.  </a></p>

<h3 id="end-use-controls">End-Use Controls</h3>

<p>If your items are not listed specifically as a result of specific sanctions regulations, you may still need a licence under so-called ‘End-Use Controls’. This aspect of export controls covers licensing of items that might potentially be used in a WMD programme or military goods.</p>

<p>These controls are outlined in Article 4 of Council Regulation 428/2009 (the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use Regulation) and in the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> 2008. For more details see the guide, <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/overview-of-export-control-legislation">Overview of export control legislation</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on End-Use Controls, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/weapons-of-mass-destruction-wmd-end-use-control">WMD End-Use Control</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes">Military End-Use Control guidance notes</a>.</p>

<p>The ‘Iran List’ provides a listing of organisations in Iran of potential concern. See the guide on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/iran-list-wmd-end-use-control">Iran List: WMD End-Use Control</a>. If you have any concerns about exporting to an end-user in Iran, you should consider seeking advice from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s End-User Advice Service. See more information about this service in the guide <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">do your goods need an export licence</a>.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-an-export-licence-to-iran">Applying for an export licence to Iran</h2>

<p>Exporters can apply for an export licence for their goods or for other transactions subject to control. All applications will be considered by the government on a case-by-case basis in line with the provisions of the Consolidated <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. Read the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/assessment-of-export-licence-applications-criteria-and-policy">assessment of export licence applications: criteria and policy</a>.</p>

<p>However, many of the restrictions against Iran are prohibitions. That means that there is a complete ban on supply to Iran. Licences will not normally be issued where there is a prohibition in place. While there are some limited exemptions to the prohibitions, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> would expect to issue an export licence only in exceptional circumstances in line with the relevant exemption and after careful assessment on a case-by-case basis against the Criteria.</p>

<p>Licences for items listed on Annex III of Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 267/2012 (previously Annex IV of Council Regulation 961/2010) will only be issued in exceptional circumstances as announced by Mark Prisk, Minister of State for Business and Enterprise on 9 November 2010.

<h2 id="iran-sanctions-key-legislation">Iran sanctions key legislation</h2>

<p>The arms embargo on Iran has been imposed by <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws, and adopted in the UK’s laws.</p>

<h3 id="un-security-council-resolutions">
<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Security Council Resolutions</h3>

<p><abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Resolution 1737 was adopted by the Security Council in December 2006. This embargo imposed a ban on the export to and import from Iran of certain technologies relating to nuclear weapons and missiles. This resolution has subsequently been extended, amended and modified by Resolution 1747 which extends the export ban to all arms and related material. Most recently the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> has imposed Resolution 1803(2008) and Resolution 1929 (2010) which further extends the embargo.</p>

<p>The Council of the European Union implemented <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737 by means of EC Regulation 423/2007 in February 2007. Following the adoption of UNSCR 1929, the European Council announced in its Declaration of 17 June 2010 that it would take further measures against Iran. These measures were confirmed by Council Decision 2010/413/CFSP of 26 July 2010.</p>
