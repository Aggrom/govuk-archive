<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>All seagoing vessels registered in the UK are assigned to a specific class, which defines their type of permitted use, determines which certification they must hold and specifies the inspection and survey regime required to comply with this certification. These classes are established and assigned by the Recognised Classification Societies, who also approve surveys and inspections.</p>

<p>This guide explains the main classes of UK-registered seagoing vessels, and gives outline details of the statutory certificates they must carry.</p>

<h2 id="certification-requirements-for-uk-vessels">Certification requirements for UK vessels</h2>

<p>The certificates that you must carry for UK-registered vessels vary according to their type, gross tonnage (<abbr title="gross tonnage">gt</abbr>), type of cargo and whether they are on a domestic or international voyage.</p>

<h2 id="merchant-ships-classification-and-certification">Merchant ships: classification and certification</h2>

<p>Merchant ships are classified by the type of cargo that they carry (general cargo, oil, chemicals, gas etc), their <abbr title="gross tonnage">gt</abbr> and the voyages they undertake, which can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>inshore, in the sea areas around the UK - for details of these, <a rel="external" href="http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/m.1747.pdf">download Marine Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Marine Shipping Notice">MSN</abbr>) 1747 The Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ships on Domestic Voyages) Regulations 2000 from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>) website (PDF, 35K)</a> </li>
  <li>short international - when the ship is never more than 200 nautical miles (nm) from a port or place of safety, and on which there is no more than 600nm between the final departure port and the first destination port</li>
  <li>long international - all other voyages between ports in two countries to which the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) applies</li>
</ul>
<p>The classes of merchant vessels are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Class VII - ships (other than those in Classes VII(A), VII(T), XI and XII) engaged on voyages, any of which are long international voyages</li>
  <li>Class VII(A) - ships employed as fish processing or canning factory ships and ships engaged in the carriage of persons employed in the fish processing or canning industries</li>
  <li>Class VII(T) - tankers engaged on voyages, any of which are long international voyages</li>
  <li>Class VIII - ships (other than ships of Classes VIII(T), IX, XI and XII) engaged only on short international voyages</li>
  <li>Class VIII(T) - tankers engaged on voyages, any of which are short international voyages</li>
  <li>Class VIII(A) - ships (other than ships of VIII(A)(T), IX, IX(A), IX(A)(T), XI and XII) engaged only on voyages which are not international voyages - this class includes small commercial vessels</li>
  <li>Class VIII(A)(T) - tankers engaged only on voyages which are not international voyages</li>

<h2 id="passenger-ships-classification-and-certification">Passenger ships: classification and certification</h2>

<p>Passenger-carrying ships are classified primarily on whether they operate inshore or on short or long international voyages. </p>

<p>The classes of passenger ships are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Class I - ships engaged on voyages any of which are long international voyages.</li>
  <li>Class II - ships engaged only on voyages any of which are short international voyages.</li>
  <li>Class II(A) - ships engaged on voyages of any kind other than international voyages, which are not ships of Classes III to VI(A).</li>
  <li>Class III - ships engaged only on voyages in the course of which they are at no time more than 70 miles by sea from their point of departure and not more than 18 miles from the coast of the UK and which are at sea only in favourable weather and during restricted periods.</li>
  <li>Class VI - ships engaged only on voyages with not more than 250 passengers on board. In favourable weather and during restricted periods, in the course of which the ships are at no time more than 15 miles from their point of departure, nor more than 3 miles from land.</li>
  <li>Class VI (A) - ships carrying not more than 50 passengers for a distance of not more than 6 miles. Voyages to or from isolated communities on the islands or coast of the UK and which do not proceed for a distance of more than 3 miles from land - this is subject to any conditions which the Secretary of State may impose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional classifications for inshore ships are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Class A - passenger ships engaged on domestic voyages other than voyages covered by Classes B, C and D</li>
  <li>Class B - a passenger ship engaged on domestic voyages in the course of which it is at no time more than 20 miles from the line of the coast</li>
  <li>Class C - a passenger ship engaged on domestic voyages in sea areas where the probability of exceeding 2.5 metres significant wave height is less than 10% over a one-year period for all-year round operation; or operating over a specific restricted period (eg summer) in the course of which it is at no time more than 15 miles from a place of refuge, nor more than 5 miles from the line of the coast</li>
  <li>Class D - a passenger ship engaged on domestic voyages in sea areas where the probability of exceeding 1.5 metres significant wave height is less than 10% over a one-year period for all-year round operation; or operating over a specific restricted period (eg summer) in the course of which it is at no time more than 15 miles from a place of refuge, nor more than 5 miles from the line of the coast</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="certification-for-passenger-ships">Certification for passenger ships</h3>

<ul>
<li>passenger ship safety certificate</li>
  <li>load line certificate required for passenger ships either operating in UK waters and of more than 80 gross tonnes (<abbr title="gross tonnage">gt</abbr>) or operating in non-UK waters and of 24 metres length (if keel was laid on or after 21 July 1968) or of more than 150gt</li>

<p>For information about requirements for the certification, see the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/shipsandcargoes/mcga-shipsregsandguidance/marinenotices.htm">guidance to legislation on the <abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> website</a></p>

<h2 id="small-commercial-vessels-and-pilot-boats-certification">Small commercial vessels and pilot boats certification</h2>

<p>The operation of small commercial vessels in the UK is covered by the Small Commercial Vessel Codes of Practice. The Codes define small commercial vessels as those of less than 24 metres load line length (or under 150 tonnes if built before 21 July 1968) which are engaged at sea and are not pleasure vessels.</p>

<p>These vessels are classed as Class VIII (A).</p>

<p>The Codes regulations and classifications apply to UK registered vessels and all other vessels which are registered or owned in another country but operate from a UK port while in UK waters.</p>

<p>Pleasure vessels are not covered by the Codes.</p>
