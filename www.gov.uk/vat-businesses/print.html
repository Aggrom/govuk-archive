<p>You can only charge <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if your business is registered for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is charged on things like: </p>

<ul>
<li>business sales - eg when you sell goods and services </li>
  <li>hiring or loaning goods to someone</li>
  <li>commission</li>
  <li>items sold to staff - eg canteen meals </li>
  <li>business goods used for personal reasons</li>
  <li>‘non-sales’ like <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/special-situations/index.htm" title="Bartering and part-exchanges and VAT">bartering, part-exchange</a> and gifts</li>
</ul>
<p>These are know as ‘taxable supplies’. There are different rules for <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/index.htm" title="VAT and international trade">imports and exports</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/vat/index.htm" title="Charities and VAT">charities.</a></p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses must:</p>

<ul>
<li>charge <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on their goods or services</li>
  <li>reclaim any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> they’ve paid on business related goods or services</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered business you must report to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) the amount of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you’ve charged and the amount of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you’ve paid. This is done through your <a href="/vat-returns" title="VAT Returns"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return</a> which is usually due every 3 months. </p>

<p>If you’ve charged more <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> than you’ve paid, you have to pay the difference to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. If you’ve paid less <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> than you’ve charged, you can reclaim the difference from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>


</article><article id="vat-rates"><header><h1>Part 2: VAT rates</h1>
  </header><p>There are 3 different rates of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and you must make sure you charge the right amount. Currently the rates are: </p>

<ul>
<li>standard rate - 20% </li>
  <li>reduced-rate - 5% </li>
  <li>zero rate - 0% </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Get a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/forms-rates/rates/goods-services.htm" title="Rates of VAT on different goods and services" rel="external">list of reduced or zero-rated goods and services.</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Standard rate</h3>

<p>Most goods and services are standard rate. You should charge this rate unless the goods or services are classed as reduced or zero-rated. </p>

<h3>Reduced rate</h3>

<p>When to charge this rate can depend on the item being provided but also the circumstance of the sale. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>children’s car seats and domestic fuel or power are always charged at 5% </li>
  <li>mobility aids for older people are only charged at 5% if they’re for someone over 60 and the goods are installed in their home </li>
</ul>
<h3>Zero rate</h3>

<p>Zero-rated means that the goods are still <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-taxable, but the rate of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you must charge your customers is 0%. Examples of zero-rated goods include:</p>

<ul>
<li>books and newspapers</li>
  <li>children’s clothes and shoes </li>
  <li>motorcycle helmets   </li>
</ul>
<p>You still have to record zero-rated transactions in your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounts and report them on your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return.  </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Rates can change and you must apply any changes to the rates from the date they change.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="when-to-charge-vat"><header><h1>Part 3: When to charge VAT</h1>
  </header><p>If a transaction is a standard, reduced or zero-rated taxable supply, you: </p>

<ul>
<li>must charge the right rate of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>must show the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> information on your invoice </li>
  <li>must show the transaction in your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account - a summary of your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> </li>
  <li>must show the amount on your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return </li>
  <li>may be able to reclaim the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> that relates to these sales </li>
</ul>
<p>You need to know the right rate of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> so you can charge it correctly and reclaim it on your purchases. </p>

<p>If you pay the wrong amount of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on a purchase, you can’t claim all of the amount you’ve paid back</p>


</article><article id="when-not-to-charge-vat"><header><h1>Part 4: When not to charge VAT</h1>
  </header><p>You can’t charge <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on exempt or ‘out of scope’ items. </p>

<h2>Exempt</h2>

<p>Exempt goods or services are supplies that you: </p>

<ul>
<li>can’t charge <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on</li>
  <li>must not include in your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> records </li>
</ul>
<p>If you buy or sell an exempt item you should still record the transaction in your general business accounts. Examples of exempt items include:</p>

<ul>
<li>insurance </li>
  <li>postage stamps or services </li>
  <li>health services provided by doctors </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Get a list of goods and services that are <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/forms-rates/rates/goods-services.htm" title="Rates of VAT on different goods and services" rel="external"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> exempt.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Out of scope</h2>

<p>Some goods and services are outside the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> tax system so you can’t charge or reclaim the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on them. For example, out of scope items include:</p>

<ul>
<li>goods or services you buy outside of the EU</li>
  <li>statutory fees - like the congestion charge or MOT testing </li>
  <li>goods you sell as part of a hobby - like stamps from a collection</li>
  <li>donations to a charity - if given without receiving anything in return </li>
</ul></article><article id="discounts-and-free-gifts"><header><h1>Part 5: Discounts and free gifts</h1>
  </header><h2>Discounts</h2>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> may have to be charged on discounts and deals. </p>
