<h2>Hazard perception</h2>

<p>‘The official guide to hazard perception’ is a comprehensive training DVD. It’s available from most high street book shops. You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1207773&amp;DI=588199&amp;trackid=004433" title="Order the guide to hazard perception from The Stationery Office">order it from The Stationery Office.</a></p>


</article><article id="what-to-bring-to-your-test"><header><h1>Part 3: What to bring to your test</h1>
  </header><p>You need to bring both parts of your driving licence - the photocard and the paper counterpart.</p>

<p>You must take your signed driving licence and a valid passport if you have an old-style paper licence.</p>

<p>No other form of photo ID will be accepted.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You test won’t go ahead and you’ll have to pay again if you don’t bring the right documents.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="how-the-test-works"><header><h1>Part 4: How the test works</h1>
  </header><p>The test takes around 1 hour 45 minutes and includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple-choice questions</li>
  <li>hazard perception</li>
</ul>
<h2>Multiple-choice questions</h2>

<p>You’ll be asked 100 questions in total. There are 25 questions in each of these 4 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>road procedure</li>
  <li>traffic signs and signals, car control, pedestrians and mechanical knowledge</li>
  <li>driving test, disabilities, and the law</li>
  <li>publications and instructional techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>The question and several possible answers will appear on a computer screen. Some will need more than one answer.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can move between questions and ‘flag’ questions that you want to come back to later.</p>
</div>

<p>You’re allowed up to 90 minutes for the multiple-choice part.</p>

<h3>How the multiple-choice scores work</h3>

<p>To pass the multiple-choice part you must get both:</p>

<ul>
<li>an overall score of at least 85 out of 100</li>
  <li>at least 20 out of 25 in each of the 4 categories</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll fail if you get an overall mark of 85 or higher, but don’t score high enough in each category.</p>
</div>

<h2>Hazard perception</h2>

<p>You’ll be shown a video clip about how the hazard perception part works.</p>

<p>You’ll then be shown 14 clips that feature everyday road scenes. There’ll be:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 developing hazard in 13 of the clips</li>
  <li>2 developing hazards in 1 of the clips</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A developing hazard is something that may cause you to take some action, such as changing speed or direction.</p>
</div>

<h3>How the hazard perception scores work</h3>

<p>You can get up to 5 points for each clip. You need to score at least 57 points out of 75 to pass this part.</p>

<p>The earlier you notice a developing hazard and make a response, the higher you score. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> </p>

<p>When you first see a parked car, it isn’t doing anything. When you get closer to it, you notice that its right-hand indicator starts to flash. The hazard is now developing and a response at this point would score marks.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You won’t score anything for a clip if you click continuously or in a pattern.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="your-test-result"><header><h1>Part 5: Your test result</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll get a pass certificate letter if you pass the test. You’ll need this when you book and take your <a href="/adi-part-2-test" title="Approved driving instructor (ADI) part 2 test">approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>) part 2 test</a>. </p>

<p>You have 2 years from passing the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 test to qualify as an <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>. You’ll need to take the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> part 1 test again if you haven’t qualified as an <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> by then.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There’s no limit on the number of times you can take the part 1 test if you don’t pass it.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="if-you-have-reading-difficulties"><header><h1>Part 6: If you have reading difficulties</h1>
  </header><p>You should tell the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) if you have dyslexia or other reading difficulties when you book your test. You can then ask for:</p>

<ul>
<li>an English voiceover</li>
  <li>extra time to take the multiple-choice part of the test</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proof of your reading difficulty</h2>

<p>You must send proof of your reading difficulty to the <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> if you need more than the normal time. The proof could be a letter from:</p>

<ul>
<li>a teacher or other education professional</li>
  <li>a doctor or other medical professional</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> will consider proof from someone independent who knows about your reading ability if you can’t get proof from one of these people, eg an employer.</p>
