<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is designed to highlight the basics of export control. Whether you are a new exporter investigating the possibility of exporting strategic goods, an overseas end-user, an academic or researcher affected by export controls or a non-governmental organisation or legal firm seeking more information, this guide will give you an overview of UK export controls.</p>

<p>This guide explains which trading activities and goods require a licence. It explains the types of licence that you can apply for, how to apply, and what compliance responsibilities you will have. Finally, it explains where you can go for help and further information.</p>

<h2 id="why-export-controls">Why export controls?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons why governments aim to control the export of goods, depending on the nature and destinations of the proposed export. The export of strategic goods and technology is the specific remit of the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>). Exports are controlled for various reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>concerns about internal repression, regional instability or other human rights violations</li>
  <li>concerns about the development of weapons of mass destruction</li>
  <li>foreign policy and international treaty commitments including as a result of the imposition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or United Nations trade sanctions or arms embargoes</li>
  <li>national and collective security of the UK and its allies</li>
</ul>
<p>Export controls are not unique to the UK. All countries should have some form of an export control policy, legislation and enforcement mechanisms. The UK has a well developed and coherent export control system based on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and national legislation. Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/overview-of-export-control-legislation">overview of export control legislation.</a></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> is only concerned with strategic goods. If you are planning to export other categories of goods such as arts, antiques, medicines or animal products, you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/export-and-import-licences-for-controlled-goods-and-trading-with-certain-countries">Import and export licences for controlled goods.</a></p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-a-licence">Do I need a licence?</h2>

<p>Whether or not you need an export licence for your goods will be determined by four factors, the:</p>

<ul>
<li>nature of the goods due to be exported</li>
  <li>destination concerned</li>
  <li>ultimate end use of the goods</li>
  <li>licensability of trade activities</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nature-of-goods">Nature of goods</h3>

<p>The following checklist outlines the broad categories of goods which are likely to be controlled:</p>

<ul>
<li>most items that have been specially designed or modified for military use and their components</li>
  <li>dual-use items - those that can be used for civil or military purposes - which meet certain specified technical standards and some of their components</li>
  <li>associated technology and software</li>
  <li>goods that might be used for torture</li>
  <li>radioactive sources</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason why these types of goods are controlled is because, they are listed on one of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists. For more information and to download the lists, see the guide on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">UK Strategic Export Control Lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items</a>.</p>

<p>The Control Lists are a listing of items for which a licence is required from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. The Consolidated List is compiled from seven lists in various pieces of international legislation. The main elements of the Consolidated List are the UK Military List and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List.</p>

<p>Depending on your goods, you will need to consult the relevant list and determine the relevant ‘rating’ or classification of your products, before applying for a licence.</p>

<p>If your goods are military, dual-use or technology/software, see the guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">strategic exports: when to request an export licence.</a></p>

<p>You should remember that the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> is concerned with goods of a ‘strategic’ nature such as military or civilian (dual-use) goods that can be used for military purposes. Export controls on other categories of goods are the responsibility of other departments. For further information see: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">Import and export licences for controlled goods.</a></p>

<h3 id="destinations">Destinations</h3>

<p>If your items are on the UK Military List or are more sensitive items on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List (ie on Annex IV of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use Regulation), then you will need a licence for all destinations - including <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>If your goods are less sensitive items on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List (Annex I items), then you will only need a licence for export outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Other items may well require a licence for destination countries that are subject to embargoes or sanctions.</p>

<h3 id="end-usecatch-all">End-use/’catch all’</h3>

<p>If your goods are not listed on the UK Strategic Export Control Lists, you may still need a licence under End-Use Controls. This applies if the goods are likely to be sent to an end-user where there are concerns about the possible use of the goods in a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme. For example, cryogenic equipment could be used in a nuclear weapons facility.</p>

<p>Components that are not designed for military use but which are going into military goods in an embargoed destination are also covered by the End-Use Controls.</p>

<p>See the guides <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">Military End-Use Control guidance notes</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/weapons-of-mass-destruction-wmd-end-use-control">Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) End-Use Control</a>.</p>

<h3 id="licensable-trade-activities">Licensable trade activities</h3>

<p>You may also need a licence if you are arranging or involved in the transfer of goods between two overseas countries. This is known as ‘trafficking and brokering’.</p>

<p>Read the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-controls-on-controlled-military-goods">trafficking and brokering (trade controls)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-licence-do-i-need">What licence do I need?</h2>

<p>There are a variety of different types of licences that you may be able to use to export your goods. The main categories of licences issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> are outlined briefly below.</p>

<h3 id="open-general-export-licences">Open General Export Licences</h3>

<p>Open General Export Licences (<abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr>) are available for less restricted exports to less restricted destinations. <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> are pre-published licences with set terms and conditions which you must adhere to. There are currently over 40 <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> available which cover a wide range of circumstances. Some are for military goods and others are for dual-use goods. A small number of <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> cover both.</p>

<p>Being an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> holder can potentially benefit your business by saving you time and money.</p>

<p>Before using, you will need to pre-register for each licence you intend to use. You will also need to carefully read and understand the relevant <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> you intend to use. You will need to make sure that you can meet all the outlined terms and conditions of the licence - eg that you only export to the exact destination allowed or that you keep the necessary records.</p>

<p>To check whether there is an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> that covers the export you wish to make, you can use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.co.uk/ogelChecker/"><abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> Checker (registration required)</a>. </p>

<p>As a registered <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> user, you will be subject to regular <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> Compliance Audits. Read the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology">compliance and enforcement of export controls</a>.</p>

<h3 id="standard-individual-export-licences-siels">Standard Individual Export Licences (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences">SIELs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If your goods, technology, software, destination or situation is not covered by an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr>, you will need to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>. <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences">SIELs</abbr> are company and consignee specific, for a set quantity and/or value of goods. You will need to provide support documentation such as End-User Undertakings with with the application.</p>

<h3 id="open-individual-export-licences-oiels">Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> also issue an Open Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>) which is designed to cover long-term contracts, projects and repeat business. This is a concessionary form of licence which is company specific, but not necessarily consignee specific. There is no set quantity or value of goods, although conditions covering this may be set on the licence. Under an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, you will receive regular compliance audits from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, so minimal support documentation is needed.</p>

<p>You will usually need to establish a track record of exporting before you can apply for an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>. It should replace at least 20 <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> applications a year.</p>

<h3 id="other-types-of-licences">Other types of licences</h3>

<p>There are also licences covering transhipment and trade control (trafficking and brokering) activities, as well as a global projects licence.</p>

<p>For more details about all licence types issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> read <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/licences-export-trade-control-and-transhipment">Licences: export, trade control and transhipment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h2>

<p>All licence applications and <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> registrations should be made electronically via the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s central online licensing system, SPIRE. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login">apply for an export licence using SPIRE on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr> website.</a></p>
</div>

<p>If you are new to using SPIRE, you can read guidance about the system such as how to create a company account and log-in details in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/spire-the-basics">SPIRE: an overview</a>.</p>

<p>When making your application, you must attach all necessary documentation, including technical specifications and End User Undertakings. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/end-user-and-consignee-undertakings-for-siels-and-oiels">end-user and consignee undertakings for <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences">SIELs</abbr> and OIELs</a>.</p>

<p>Almost half of all export licence applications have to be returned due to incomplete or inaccurate applications which can cause delays in processing. Therefore it is vital that before applying you read about the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/submitting-export-licence-applications-correctly">common pitfalls to avoid in export licence applications</a>.</p>

<p>A step-by-step explanation of the stages involved in making your application, including information on licensing targets is available in the guide on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-control-licensing-process-and-how-to-appeal">export control licensing process and how to appeal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="advisory-services">Advisory services</h3>

<p>On SPIRE you can also make a Control List Classification Service or End-User Advice Service request. You should note that these are both advisory services only and not licensing.</p>

<p>For more information about both these services see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">Do your goods need an export licence?</a></p>

<h2 id="responsibilities-and-obligations">Responsibilities and obligations</h2>

<p>As an exporter, you have various responsibilities. You need to ensure that you have solid export control systems and procedures in place in terms of record keeping, training and lines of responsibility.</p>

<p>Businesses that have registered to use <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> for exporting items or who have been granted an Open Individual Export Licence are subject to regular compliance visits. Read the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology">compliance and enforcement of export controls</a>.</p>

Penalties range from de-registration of your licence to fines or even a potential prison term if you do not adhere to your export control obligations.

<h3 id="eco-searchable-database">
<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> searchable database</h3>

<p>Export control statistical and report information is available on <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s searchable database. This tool provides quarterly licensing reports as well as the option to produce bespoke reports of licences issued, refused and revoked, licence processing times and refusals. You can also <a rel="external" href="https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/sdb/SDBHOME">find quarterly licence reports</a> on the Strategic Export Controls: Reports and Statistics website.</p>

<h3 id="advisory-services-and-tools">Advisory services and tools</h3>

<p>If you are unsure whether your goods need an export licence, you can either ‘self-rate’ or make use of the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s advisory services.</p>

<p>To assist you in ‘self-rating’, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> provides two tools which are designed to help you in identifying the ‘rating’ entry number of your particular goods on a UK Strategic Export Control List.</p>

<p>The Control List Classification Search Tool is available via <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s SPIRE export licensing database. It is designed to help you search on previous ‘rating’ assessments made by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s Technical Assessment Unit. By using the tool, you can get an indication of whether your items are listed on a Control List and what the ‘rating’ entry for your particular goods might be.</p>

<p>The search tool is designed to work in conjunction with the Goods Checker Database. This is a separate website which enables you to perform key word searches on the specific wording of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.co.uk/goodschecker/">use the Goods Checker</a> on the Checker Tools website (registration required).</p>

<p>If you are unable to ‘self-rate’, you can make a Control List Classification Service request online via the SPIRE database. This is a non-statuatory advice service which does not constitute the issuing of an actual licence but advises you of the ‘rating’ entry of your goods on the UK Strategic Export Control Lists.</p>

<p>If you are already aware that your goods are not listed on a UK Strategic Export Control List or are subject to sanctions and embargoes, but you have concerns about end-use, then you can submit an End-User Advice Service request via the SPIRE database.</p>

<p>Make either a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/controlled-goods-export-licence-all-uk">Control List Classification Service or End-User Advice Service request</a> on the SPIRE website with <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>. </p>

<p>For more information about these services, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">Do your goods need an export licence?</a></p>

<h3 id="ogel-checker-database">
<abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> Checker Database</h3>

<p>This is a web-based search tool to help exporters find out whether there are any <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> they may be able to use when exporting their goods, software or technology. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.co.uk/ogelChecker">use the <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> checker on the Checker Tools website (registration required).</a></p>
