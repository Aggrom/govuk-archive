<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are a grower or farmer, you may use seed that you have saved for your own use to grow and harvest a crop - this is known as Farm Saved Seed (<abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Under section nine of the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare all their use of <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> and pay for their use of eligible varieties. These royalty payments support continued investment in improved varieties, bred for UK conditions.</p>

<p>This guide explains which <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> species are eligible for payment, and how growers and farmers can ensure they have complied with the <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> rules. It also explains how to declare and make payments for <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> online, and offers helpful sources of further information. You can also find out what Plant Breeders’ Rights (<abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>) are and how they may apply to your business.</p>

<h2 id="plant-breeders-rights-and-compliance-with-fss-rules">Plant Breeders’ Rights and compliance with <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> rules</h2>

<p>Plant breeding has vastly improved the yield, quality and performance of agricultural crops in the UK. It remains a vital industry to keep Great Britain internationally competitive.</p>

<p>Plant Breeders’ Rights give the breeder legal rights over the plant varieties they have developed and allow them to charge royalties for using these ‘protected’ varieties. If you are a breeder, this can provide funding for your work.</p>

<p>In the UK, <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> are administered by the Food and Environmental Research Agency (<abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr>) Plant Variety Rights Team in Cambridge.</p>

<p><abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> is seed planted on a farmer’s own land using seed harvested from their own holding. Your ‘own holding’ may comprise of more than one farm, as long as all holdings are managed under the same business. By law, you cannot market, purchase, transfer or give seed from one business to another for subsequent re-planting.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/plant-breeders-rights">Plant Breeders’ Rights (<abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-comply-with-the-fss-rules">How to comply with the <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> rules</h3>

<p>You must declare all your use of <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> to the British Society of Plant Breeders (<abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>) and pay royalties on eligible varieties.</p>

<p>The legal requirement to declare applies whether the seed has been processed or taken straight from the barn.</p>

<p>If you receive an <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> declaration form from the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>, you are legally obliged to complete and return it to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Used 100 per cent certified seed - you should simply declare this, sign the form and return it to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>. You need take no further action.</li>
  <li>Had all your <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> processed via a registered seed processor, and have already paid to use eligible varieties - you should declare this, provide the relevant details, sign the form and return it to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>. You need take no further action.</li>
  <li>Used <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> which has not been paid for via a registered processor - eg if it has been self-processed or sown straight from the barn, you must declare your use of that seed and make any payment due direct to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="farm-saved-seed-and-cereals">Farm Saved Seed and cereals</h2>

<p>Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare and pay for all eligible varieties of <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> they use to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> collects royalties on <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> from growers for the following cereals:</p>

<ul>
<li>oats</li>
  <li>barley</li>
  <li>rice</li>
  <li>canary grass</li>
  <li>rye</li>
  <li>triticale</li>
  <li>wheat</li>
  <li>durum wheat</li>
  <li>spelt wheat</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> and the UK farming unions have agreed that you do not need to pay for the genuine use of certain older varieties as <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr>. These formerly zero-rated varieties now qualify for a 100 per cent instant refund:</p>

<ul>
<li>winter wheat</li>
  <li>winter barley</li>
  <li>spring barley</li>
  <li>fresco</li>
  <li>halcyon</li>
  <li>chariot</li>
  <li>haven</li>
  <li>intro</li>
  <li>dandy</li>

  <li>soissons</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bspb.co.uk/fssd/paymentrates_combinable.html">find current payment rates and eligible varieties for combinable crops on the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="certification-marketing-packaging-and-labelling-of-cereal-seed">Certification, marketing, packaging and labelling of cereal seed</h3>

<p>If you produce and/or market cereal seed, your seed must be certified by <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> before it can be marketed. If you attempt to market seed that has not been certified, you could face legal action.</p>

<p>To be certified, the seed must be a variety on the UK National List or in the European Community Common Catalogue. For information on national listing, see the guide on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-lists-of-agricultural-and-vegetable-crops">agricultural and vegetable crops: the National Lists</a>.</p>

<p>Your crop must also be inspected and a sample from your seed lot must be tested. <abbr title="National Institute of Agricultural Botany">NIAB</abbr> deals with all the applications for seed certification. You must lodge a crop inspection report with <abbr title="National Institute of Agricultural Botany">NIAB</abbr> within one month of receiving it.</p>

<p>You must be registered with <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> before you can market seed covered by the cereal seed regulations. Packages of seed must be properly sealed and labelled, usually by a licensed seed sampler.</p>

<h2 id="farm-saved-seed-and-fodder-plants">Farm Saved Seed and fodder plants</h2>

<p>Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare and pay for all eligible varieties of <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> they use to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare and pay for all eligible varieties of <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> they use to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> collects royalties on <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> from growers of eligible potato varieties.</p>

<p><abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> potato rates for each eligible potato variety are set by the variety owners. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bspb.co.uk/fssd/paymentrates_potatoes.html">Find information about payment rates and eligible varieties for potatoes on the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Under plant health regulations, potatoes can only be sown as <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> for one generation after certified seed. Growers who have purchased certified seed of potato varieties eligible for <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> payments will automatically receive an <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> declaration form to complete and return to <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> the following year.</p>

<p>Under the Plant Varieties Act 1997, farmers must declare all <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> they use to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> and pay for eligible varieties. The <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> collects royalties on <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> from growers of beet.</p>

<h3 id="certification-marketing-packaging-and-labelling-of-beet-seeds">Certification, marketing, packaging and labelling of beet seeds</h3>

<p>If you produce and/or market beet seed, your seed must be certified by the <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> before it can be marketed. To be certified, the seed must be a variety on the UK National List or in the European Community Common Catalogue. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-lists-of-agricultural-and-vegetable-crops">agricultural and vegetable crops: the National Lists</a>.</p>

<p>Your crop must also be inspected and a sample from your seed lot must be tested. <abbr title="National Institute of Agricultural Botany">NIAB</abbr> deals with all applications for seed certification. You must lodge a crop inspection report with <abbr title="National Institute of Agricultural Botany">NIAB</abbr> within one month of receiving it.</p>

<p>If certification is withdrawn from a seed lot, you must notify anyone you have marketed the seed to within seven days of receiving the notice. You must be registered with <abbr title="Food and Environmental Research Agency">Fera</abbr> before you can market seed covered by the beet seed regulations.</p>

<p>Packages of seed must be properly sealed and labelled, usually by a licensed seed sampler.</p>

<p>You may face legal action if you do not comply with the regulations.</p>

<h2 id="declaring-and-paying-for-farm-saved-seed">Declaring and paying for Farm Saved Seed</h2>

<p>There are several key <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> rules that farmers must follow. As a farmer, you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must declare all the <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> you use, whether it is eligible for payment or zero-rated. You must pay for eligible varieties. However, small farmers - as defined under EU law - are exempt and do not have to declare or pay for their use of <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Can only use <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> that has been produced and saved within your own business - ie land farmed as the same business.</li>
  <li>Cannot sell, buy, barter or transfer <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> outside your own holding.</li>
</ul>
<p>These <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> rules always apply, whether the seed has been processed or taken straight from the barn.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-fss-use">Reporting <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> use</h3>

<p>You can report your <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> use to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> using any of these four methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>send back the declaration form in the envelope provided</li>
  <li>email the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> at <a href="mailto:enquiries@bspb.co.uk">enquiries@bspb.co.uk</a>

</ul>
<h3 id="who-sets-the-payment-rates-on-fss">Who sets the payment rates on <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr>?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> payment rates for each crop species are agreed annually between the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> and farming unions, taking into account trends in the use of certified <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> and average royalty rates on certified seed. The exception is potatoes.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> publishes details of eligible varieties and payment rates annually, and automatically calculates and invoices any outstanding payments.</p>

<h3 id="who-collects-fss-payments-and-where-does-the-money-go">Who collects <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> payments and where does the money go?</h3>

<p><abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> collects <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> payments on behalf of plant breeders. Administration costs for the UK system amount to just seven pence per £1 collected, significantly less than equivalent systems in other EU member states. The remaining income is disbursed to individual plant breeders.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-farmers-pay-bspb-to-collect-fss-payments">How can farmers pay <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> to collect <abbr title="Farm Saved Seed">FSS</abbr> payments?</h3>

<p>There are two ways to pay <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> for using eligible seed varieties:</p>

<ul>
<li>via your National Association of Agricultural Contractors or <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>-registered seed processor as a component of the processing invoice at a tonnage rate - most farmers pay this way</li>
  <li>direct to the <abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> at a hectarage rate - for farmers who have not paid through their seed processor, or who have sown straight from the barn</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr> publishes tonnage and hectarage rates annually.</p>
