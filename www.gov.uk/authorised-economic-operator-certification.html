<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Authorised Economic Operator (<abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr>) certificate is an internationally recognised quality mark indicating that your role in the international supply chain is secure, and that your customs controls and procedures are efficient and compliant.</p>

<p><abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> status is not mandatory. It is a commercial decision as it gives quicker access to certain simplified customs procedures and in some cases the right to ‘fast-track’ your shipments through certain HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) safety and security procedures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> status is for businesses that are established in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, actively involved in customs operations and international trade and have an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme">Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>)</a> number. In some circumstances, airline or shipping companies established outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> may also be eligible for <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> status. The European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>)’s <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> database allows anyone to check who holds a certificate, which type it is, and the date and country of issue.</p>

<p>This guide explains the benefits that an <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> certificate can bring you, who can apply for one, criteria you have to meet to be eligible, and how to apply.</p>

<h2 id="aeo-news">
<abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> news</h2>

<p>Under data protection requirements, holders of an <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> authorisation need to give permission for some limited data to be shared with third country customs authorities. This will enable their <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> status in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to be recognised and benefits to be applied. The C118 <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> Self-Assessment Questionnaire requires that new applicants give their consent to publication and exchange of <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> data</p>

<h3 id="financial-solvency-criteria">Financial solvency criteria</h3>

<p>Recent experience has shown that some <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> applicants, to enable them to meet the <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> financial solvency criteria, have referred to a ‘letter of comfort’ type document.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, examples seen so far are not acceptable to <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Legal services have drawn up an example of a form of legal ‘guarantee’ which is acceptable for the purpose of a parent company covering certain debts of a UK legal entity. This document would need to be presented during the audit process.</p>

<p>Businesses involved in the import or export of fish can apply for <abbr title="Approved Economic Operator">APEO</abbr> status but must hold, or be in the process of obtaining, <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> status and should use application form C115 for Approved Economic Operator (<abbr title="Approved Economic Operator">APEO</abbr>). <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_PROD1_030334">Download application form for an <abbr title="Approved Economic Operator">APEO</abbr> certificate from the <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 67K)</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from the business benefits of <abbr title="Approved Economic Operator">APEO</abbr> status, it is an important element in the fisheries control system. For more information, see the guide on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. </p>

<p>You can also request <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> draft Guidance v6 via email from the <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> Team by emailing them at <a href="mailto:AEOTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">AEOTeam@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the authorisation criteria of your <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> certificate, the benefits can include easier access to certain customs simplifications, some easing in customs security and safety controls, or both.</p>

<p>A Customs Simplifications <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> certificate (<abbr title="Customs Simplifications AEO certificate">AEOC</abbr>), which is issued to any business that fulfils the specified criteria in the areas of:</p>

<ul>
<li>customs compliance</li>
  <li>record-keeping standards</li>
  <li>financial solvency</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hold <abbr title="Customs Simplifications AEO certificate">AEOC</abbr> status it will speed up the process of authorisation if you apply for any of the following customs procedures:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Local Clearance Procedure under <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Freight Simplified Procedures (<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>) and the National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>)</li>
  <li>simplified declaration procedure under <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> and <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>
</li>
  <li>simplifications for regular shipping services</li>
</ul>
<p>A Security and Safety <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> certificate (<abbr title="Security and Safety AEO certificate">AEOS</abbr>) is issued to any business that fulfils all of the above criteria and also maintains appropriate security and safety standards. You’ll benefit from:</p>

<ul>
<li>a lower risk score used to determine the frequency of customs physical and documentary checks</li>
  <li>consignments may be fast-tracked through customs control</li>
  <li>reduced requirements for the mandatory pre-arrival/pre-departure Entry Summary Declarations (<abbr title="Entry Summary Declarations">ENS</abbr>) or Exit Summary Declarations (<abbr title="Exit Summary Declarations">EXS</abbr>)  which carriers must make</li>
  <li>potential for future reciprocal arrangements and mutual recognition with countries outside the European Community, for example, USA or trading partners that adopt the World Customs Organisation (WCO) Safe framework</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on <abbr title="Entry Summary Declarations">ENS</abbr>, see the guide on the Import Control System. For the detail on <abbr title="Exit Summary Declarations">EXS</abbr>, see the guide on export declarations and the National Export System.</p>

<p>A Combined Customs Simplifications/Security and Safety <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> certificate (<abbr title="Combined Customs Simplifications/Security and Safety AEO certificate">AEOF</abbr>) is available to any business which meets all the relevant criteria for both types of certificate and which wants to receive the benefits of both types of <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Whichever certificate you hold, you’ll benefit from:</p>

<ul>
<li>recognised status across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an industry ‘kite mark’, which is a useful marketing tool</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aeos-and-the-security-amendments-to-the-customs-code">
<abbr title="Authorised Economic Operators">AEOs</abbr> and the security amendments to the Customs Code</h3>

<p>The security amendment to the Customs Code aims to ensure an equal level of protection in terms of risk analysis and customs controls for all goods brought into or out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For practical examples on the documentation required and the reduced requirements for an <abbr title="Security and Safety AEO certificate">AEOS</abbr> or <abbr title="Combined Customs Simplifications/Security and Safety AEO certificate">AEOF</abbr>, <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/ecip/model_transactions/index_en.htm">find import, export and transit scenarios on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="airlines-and-shipping-companies">Airlines and shipping companies</h3>

<p>If you’re an airline or shipping company established outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and already benefit from the simplifications in drawing up manifests then you’re deemed to have met the criteria for:</p>

<ul>
<li>record of compliance</li>
  <li>customs brokers and agents</li>
  <li>management and record-keeping systems</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, however, you must also be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a holder of an appropriate internationally recognised security and/or safety certificate</li>
  <li>a regulated agent</li>
  <li>a holder of a certificate issued in a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country if it’s accepted in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hold an internationally recognised security and/or safety certificate, then any criteria you had to meet for that certificate also count as meeting the corresponding criteria necessary for an <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> security and safety certificate.</p>

Each legal entity will receive a separate certificate and authorisation number.</p>
