It used to be called the State Second Pension or State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (<abbr title="State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme">SERPS</abbr>).

  </header><p>You can get Additional State Pension if you’re employed by a company and earning over £5,564.</p>

<p>You may also be able to get Additional State Pension if you’re getting some benefits, for instance, if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>looking after children under 12 years old and claiming Child Benefit</li>
  <li>caring for a sick or disabled person for more than 20 hours a week and claiming Carer’s Credit</li>
  <li>a registered foster carer and claiming Carer’s Credit</li>
  <li>getting illness or disability benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t normally get Additional State Pension for when you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>self-employed</li>
  <li>unemployed</li>
  <li>in full-time training</li>
</ul>

  </header><h2>Contracting out of the Additional State Pension</h2>

<p>You can contract out of the Additional State Pension by joining a company, stakeholder or personal pension instead.</p>

<h3>Company pension</h3>

<p>Both you and your employer will pay lower, reduced rate National Insurance contributions. When you retire, you’ll get a pension from your employer’s (or company) scheme</p>

<h3>Stakeholder or personal pension</h3>

<p>You won’t pay lower National Insurance contributions. Instead, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will pay a rebate of your National Insurance contributions directly into your pension once a year.</p>

<h2>Changes to pensions contracted out on a defined contribution (or money purchase) basis from 2012</h2>

<p>The rules for contracting out of the Additional State Pension on a defined contribution basis will change in 2012. </p>

<h3>If you haven’t already contracted out</h3>

<p>The changes mean that you won’t be able to contract out of the Additional State Pension and get one of the following instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>a money-purchase company pension</li>
  <li>a personal pension</li>
  <li>a stakeholder pension</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll still be able to contract out of the Additional State Pension into a defined benefit company pension.</p>

<h3>If you’re already contracted out</h3>

<p>If you’re already contracted out into a money-purchase company pension, personal or stakeholder pension, you can continue (until 5 April 2012) to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make your own contributions to your pension</li>
  <li>benefit from any employer contributions to your pension</li>
  <li>benefit from lower NI contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re contracted out through one of these schemes on 6 April 2012, you’ll automatically be brought back into the Additional State Pension and may, depending on your earnings, begin to contribute to Additional State Pension from this date. </p>
