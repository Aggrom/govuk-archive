<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This guidance is to be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/rents-lettings-and-tenancies">series on rents, lettings and tenancies</a> which includes the latest statistical releases and sets of live tables.</p>

<h2 id="rent">Rent</h2>

<h3 id="local-authority-rent-levels">Local authority rent levels</h3>

<p>Information on how much local authorities charge for their properties is collected through the Housing Revenue Account Subsidy Claim Form up until April 2012. Following the move to Housing Revenue Account self-financing, local authorities are no longer required to complete the Subsidy Claim Form. To ensure that key data on rent levels and stock composition are still collected, the Local Authority Housing Statistics (<abbr title="Local Authority Housing Statistics">LAHS</abbr>) return captures this information for the first time in 2011 to 2012. This provides an overlap in the local authority rent data collected.</p>

<p>The following tables are based on information collected from local authorities from the Housing Revenue Account Second Subsidy Claim Form and the Local Authority Housing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table 701 gives the average rents by regions for local authority housing</li>
  <li>Table 702 gives the average rents by local authority district for local authority housing</li>
  <li>Chart 705 shows the rent increases for the United Kingdom as a whole separating with the rate above the Retail Prices Index separately identified</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-registered-provider-rent-levels">Private Registered Provider rent levels</h3>

<p>Data on the cost of renting Private Registered Provider (housing association) properties comes from the Statistical Data Return (<abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr>) managed by the Homes and Communities Agency (<abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency">HCA</abbr>). This replaced the Regulatory and Statistical Return (<abbr title="Regulatory and Statistical Return">RSR</abbr>) managed by the Tenants Services Authority (TSA) when the <abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency">HCA</abbr>  took over responsibility for the regulation of social housing providers in England from the TSA on 1 April 2012. The <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> is an annual return that has to be completed by all private Registered Providers, although smaller providers have a shorter form to complete.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> captures a wide variety of information from each Private Registered Provider (<abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>) about all properties owned by the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>. More information about the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/news/statistical-data-return">Homes and Communities Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>The following live table gives the average rents by district for all <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> lettings based on the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> (and its predecessor, <abbr title="Regulatory and Statistical Return">RSR</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Table 704 gives Private Registered Provider average weekly rents, by district</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-continuous-recording-system-core">The Continuous Recording system (<abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The Continuous Recording system (referred to as <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr>) collects rents charged for newly let Private Registered Provider and local authority properties. <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr> is a national information source that records information on the characteristics of both housing association and local authority new social housing tenants and the homes they rent and buy. <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr> provides an invaluable source of information about new lets, sales and tenants, for example, household characteristics, economic status, ethnicity, primary reason for housing, source of referral and previous tenure of occupant. In addition, since information regarding housing costs is also recorded, broad assessments of housing affordability are also possible through <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Up until April 2004 only Private Registered Provider lettings and sales were covered by <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr>. After that date coverage was extended to include lettings of local authority (council) housing. <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr> covers all new tenancy agreements, including tenants who are new to the sector and tenants who are moving properties either within the Registered Provider or between Registered Providers. <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr> also captures information about the types of tenancy agreements and previous tenure of the new tenants. As of April 2009 TNS Research International (TNS-RI) are responsible for managing <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The main difference between <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr>, the Statistical Data Return and the Local Authority Housing Statistics return is that <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr> captures information on the rents paid for new tenancies only, whereas the <abbr title="Statistical Data Return">SDR</abbr> and <abbr title="Local Authority Housing Statistics">LAHS</abbr> cover all properties including new and existing tenancies.</p>

<h2 id="private-sector-rent-levels">Private sector rent levels</h2>

<p>Private sector (free market) rent levels are available at regional level only. The source for this information is the English Housing Survey. In April 2008 the Survey of English Housing was integrated with the English House Condition Survey to form the new English Housing Survey and data for 2008 to 2009 onwards will therefore be from the English Housing Survey.</p>

<p>Data on private rents and further information is available in the English Housing Survey section.</p>

<p>The Valuation Office Agency publishes statistics on the private rental market for England. They provide mean (average), median, lower quartile, and upper quartile gross monthly rent paid (ignoring any adjustment for services not eligible for housing benefit), for a number of bedroom/room categories for each local authority in England.</p>

<p>The Valuation Office Agency Rent Officers work within the private rented sector in England, providing valuation services for local authorities, landlords and tenants. Their main statutory functions are to:</p>

<p>Determine and publish monthly Local Housing Allowance rates for every local authority in England: Local Housing Allowance applies to those private sector tenants who make a new claim for housing benefit or have changed address on or after 7 April 2008. Rent Officers publish 152 sets of Local Housing Allowance rates every month.</p>

<p>Provide Local Reference Rent scheme Housing Benefit determinations to local authorities: People who have been claiming housing benefit prior to 7 April 2008, continue to receive the benefit based on a range of valuations provided to local authorities by the Rent Officer.</p>

<p>Provide ‘Fair Rent’ registrations: Rent Officers can register a Fair Rent for most private sector tenancies which started before 15 January 1989 under the Rent Act 1977. They can also register a Fair Rent under the Rent (Agriculture) Act. A Fair Rent is the maximum rent that can be charged for the tenancy.</p>

<p>Further information is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/">Valuation Office Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="lettings-and-tenancies-in-the-social-sector">Lettings and tenancies in the social sector</h2>

<p>Local authority lettings data include information on: the housing register (waiting lists); Choice-Based Lettings scheme; nominations; and mobility schemes.</p>

<p>Until 2010 to 2011, these were collected annually from the Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix (HSSA) return. From 2011 to 2012, they are collected annually from the Local Authority Housing Statistics return. The latest copy of this return and the full range of data that we collect can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/local-authority-housing-data">Local authority housing data section</a>.</p>

<p>The following live tables contain information on new lettings collected by <abbr title="Continuous Recording system">CORE</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table 750 gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by household type</li>
  <li>Table 751 gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by age of gender of household reference person</li>
  <li>Table 752 gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by economic status of household reference person</li>
  <li>Table 753 gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by ethnic origin of household reference person</li>
  <li>Table 754 gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by nationality of household reference person.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discontinued-tables">Discontinued tables</h2>

<p>In 2008 the Survey of English Housing was merged with the English House Condition Survey to form the English Housing Survey. As a result, a number of Housing Statistics Live Tables are no longer being updated with data from the Survey of English Housing or other surveys. Tables based on data from the English Housing Survey can instead be found at the English Housing Survey Household Live Tables page.</p>

<p>Please note that a number of methodological changes were introduced at the time of the merger, particularly in relation to the derivation of rents, which mean that a direct comparison of English Housing Survey and Survey of English Housing data is not always possible. Details of these changes can be found in Appendix C of the English Housing Survey Household Report 2008-09.</p>

<p>Copies of reports and further information are available in the English Housing Survey section.</p>

<p>As a result, the following tables have been archived and are available upon request from <a href="mailto:housing.statistics@communities.gsi.gov.uk">housing.statistics@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table 715: rents and rent types, by tenure and region, from 1994</li>
  <li>Table 718: household units receiving housing benefit, average benefit, from 1992</li>
  <li>Table 731: private tenancies and rents, by type of tenancy</li>
  <li>Chart 732: private and local authority rents and tenancies, by tenancy type, latest 2 years comparison (chart)</li>
  <li>Chart 733: private tenancies by tenancy type (chart)</li>
  <li>Table 734: private rents, by tenancy type and region</li>
  <li>Table 740: private sector rent index (Q2 2000=100)</li>
</ul>
<p>Live tables relating to registered fair rents and rent determinations have also been removed from this page. The following tables have been archived and are available upon request from <a href="mailto:housing.statistics@communities.gsi.gov.uk">housing.statistics@communities.gsi.gov.uk</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table 706: rent appeals and outcomes, England, London, Rest of England, Wales</li>
  <li>Table 711: registered fair rents, England, Wales, London</li>
  <li>Table 712: registered fair rents, England, Wales, London (quarterly)</li>
  <li>Table 713: rent determinations by rent officers in housing benefit cases England, London, Rest of England, Wales</li>
  <li>Table 714: rent determinations by rent officers in housing benefit cases, England, London, Rest of England, Wales (quarterly)</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistics relating to the private rental market can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/">Valuation Office Agency website</a>. The Valuation Office Agency is also responsible for the monitoring and control of Fair Rents and provide the Electronic Rent Register.</p>

<p>The following tables relating to rent and housing benefit have also been discontinued:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table 735: rent paid before deduction of housing benefit, by tenure and age of head of household reference person</li>
  <li>Table 736: rent paid after deduction of housing benefit, by tenure and age of head of household reference person</li>
  <li>Table 737: rent paid after deduction of housing benefit, by tenure and disposable income of household reference person and partner</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistics on housing benefit can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/">Department for Work and Pensions website</a>.</p>

<p>As set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/local-statistics-written-ministerial-statement">Written Ministerial Statement</a> on 18 September 2012, the Department no longer publishes statistics at a regional level. This follows the abolition of regional government by the Coalition who do not believe that regions provide a coherent or meaningful framework for assessing public policy. Instead, our published statistics present, where relevant, other sub-national geographies which are more aligned with public policy. If required, the published data by local authority can be used to compile figures relating to the old regional government boundaries by users. 
As a result, the following tables are no longer being updated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table 601 gives the number of local authority lettings information for: the number of new lettings to homeless and other households; number related to exchanges and transfers; and number of secure and non secure tenancies</li>
  <li>Table 703 gives private Registered Provider average weekly rents, by region</li>
</ul>
