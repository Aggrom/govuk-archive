<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This guidance is to be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/rents-lettings-and-tenancies">series on rents, lettings and tenancies</a> which includes the latest statistical releases and sets of live tables.</p>

<h2 id="rent">Rent</h2>

<h3 id="social-rent-levels">Social rent levels</h3>

<p>Information on how much local authorities charge for their properties is collected through the Housing Revenue Account Subsidy Claim Form up until April 2012. Data on the cost of renting private Registered Provider (housing association) properties comes from two sources managed by the Tenants Services Authority:</p>

<p>The Regulatory and Statistical Return (RSR) for rents charged for all private Registered Provider properties. The RSR is an annual return that has to be completed by all private Registered Providers, although smaller providers have a shorter form to complete.
The Continuous Recording system (referred to as CORE) for rents charged for newly let Registered Provider properties.</p>

<h3 id="private-registered-provider-rent-levels">Private Registered Provider rent levels</h3>

<p>The Regulatory and Statistical Return (RSR) captures a wide variety of information from each private Registered Provider (pRP) about all properties owned by the pRP. From 2012 this is being replaced by a new survey, NROSH+. It is expected that the key information required to keep the live tables up to date will be sourced from NROSH+.</p>

<p>Full information collected in the RSR is available on the Tenant Services Authority website (external link).</p>

<p>The following live tables give the average rents by region/district for all pRP lettings based on the RSR:</p>

<p>Table 703: Gives pivate Registered Provider average weekly rents, by region</p>

<p>Table 704: Gives private Registered Provider average weekly rents, by district</p>

<p>COntinuous REcording system (CORE) is a national information source that records information on the characteristics of both housing association and local authority new social housing tenants and the homes they rent and buy. Policy makers and practitioners regard the system as an essential tool for monitoring housing costs, assessing affordability and developing policy.</p>

<p>CORE provides an invaluable source of information about new lets, sales and tenants, for example, household characteristics, economic status, ethnicity, primary reason for housing, source of referral and previous tenure of occupant. In addition, since information regarding housing costs is also recorded, broad assessments of housing affordability are also possible through CORE. Information from CORE is therefore used by a range of organisations to inform funding, regulatory and other policy decisions and contributes to the wider policy debate. The extension of CORE to the local authority sector is working towards a complete and consistent set of figures countrywide.</p>

<p>As of April 2009 TNS Research International (TNS-RI) are responsible for managing CORE.</p>

<p>Up until April 2004 only housing association lettings and sales were covered by CORE. After that date coverage was extended to include lettings of local authority (council) housing. Another change in April 2004 was that a single combined lettings log was introduced to replace the previous ‘General Needs’ log and the ‘Supported Housing’ log. In 2011/12 additional changes were made to cover the Affordable Rent lettings.</p>

<p>CORE covers all new tenancy agreements, including tenants who are new to the sector and tenants who are moving properties either within the same housing association or between housing associations. CORE also captures information about the types of tenancy agreements and previous tenure of the new tenants.</p>

<p>The main difference between CORE and the RSR is that CORE captures information on the rents paid for new tenancies only, whereas the RSR covers all private Registered Provider properties including new and existing tenancies.</p>

<h2 id="local-authority-rent-levels">Local authority rent levels</h2>

<p>To complete the picture on social renting the following tables are based on information collected from local authorities from the Housing Revenue Account Second Subsidy Claim Form:</p>

<p>Table 701: Gives the average rents by regions for local authority housing</p>

<p>Table 702: Gives the average rents by local authority district for local authority housing</p>

<p>Chart 705: Shows the rent increases for the United Kingdom as a whole separating with the rate above the Retail Prices Index separately identified.</p>

<h2 id="private-sector-rent-levels">Private sector rent levels</h2>

<p>Private sector (free market) rent levels are available at regional level only. The source for this information is the English Housing Survey. In April 2008 the Survey of English Housing was integrated with the English House Condition Survey to form the new English Housing Survey and data for 2008/09 onwards will therefore be from the English Housing Survey.</p>

<h3 id="data-on-private-rents-and-further-information-is-available-in-the-english-housing-survey-section">Data on private rents and further information is available in the English Housing Survey section.</h3>

<p>The Valuation Office Agency publishes statistics on the private rental market for England. They provide mean (average), median, lower quartile, and upper quartile gross monthly rent paid (ignoring any adjustment for services not eligible for housing benefit), for a number of bedroom/room categories for each local authority in England.</p>

<p>The Valuation Office Agency Rent Officers work within the private rented sector in England, providing valuation services for local authorities, landlords and tenants. Their main statutory functions are to:</p>

<p>Determine and publish monthly Local Housing Allowance rates for every local authority in England: Local Housing Allowance applies to those private sector tenants who make a new claim for housing benefit or have changed address on or after 7 April 2008. Rent Officers publish 152 sets of Local Housing Allowance rates every month.
Provide Local Reference Rent scheme Housing Benefit determinations to local authorities: People who have been claiming housing benefit prior to 7 April 2008, continue to receive the benefit based on a range of valuations provided to local authorities by the Rent Officer.
Provide ‘Fair Rent’ registrations: Rent Officers can register a Fair Rent for most private sector tenancies which started before 15 January 1989 under the Rent Act 1977. They can also register a Fair Rent under the Rent (Agriculture) Act. A Fair Rent is the maximum rent that can be charged for the tenancy.
Further information is available on the Valuation Office Agency website (external link).</p>

<h2 id="lettings-and-tenancies-in-the-social-sector">Lettings and tenancies in the social sector</h2>

<p>Local authority lettings data include information on: the housing register (waiting lists); Choice-Based Lettings scheme; nominations; and mobility schemes.</p>

<p>These are collected annually from the Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix (HSSA) return. The latest copy of this return and the full range of data that we collect can be found in the Local authority housing strategy and business plan data section.</p>

<p>Table 601: Gives the number of local authority lettings information for: the number of new lettings to homeless and others households; number related to exchanges and transfers; and number of secure and non secure tenancies.</p>

<p>The following live tables contain information on new lettings collected by CORE:</p>

<p>Table 750: Gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by household type</p>

<p>Table 751: Gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by age of gender of household reference person</p>

<p>Table 752: Gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by economic status of household reference person</p>

<p>Table 753: Gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by ethnic origin of household reference person</p>

<p>Table 754: Gives general needs social lettings made by private Registered Providers and local authority landlords, by nationality of household reference person.</p>

<h2 id="discontinued-tables">Discontinued tables</h2>

<p>In 2008 the Survey of English Housing was merged with the English House Condition Survey to form the English Housing Survey. As a result, a number of Housing Statistics Live Tables are no longer being updated with data from the Survey of English Housing or other surveys. Tables based on data from the English Housing Survey can instead be found at the English Housing Survey Household Live Tables page.</p>

<p>Please note that a number of methodological changes were introduced at the time of the merger, particularly in relation to the derivation of rents, which mean that a direct comparison of English Housing Survey and Survey of English Housing data is not always possible. Details of these changes can be found in Appendix C of the English Housing Survey Household Report 2008-09.</p>

<p>Copies of reports and further information are available in the English Housing Survey section.</p>

<p>As a result, the following tables have been archived and are available upon request from housing.statistics@communities.gsi.gov.uk:</p>

<p>Table 715: Rents and rent types, by tenure and region, from 1994
Table 718: Household units receiving housing benefit, average benefit, from 1992
Table 731: Private tenancies and rents, by type of tenancy
Chart 732: Private and local authority rents and tenancies, by tenancy type, latest 2 years comparison (chart)
Chart 733: Private tenancies by tenancy type (chart)
Table 734: Private rents, by tenancy type and region
Table 740: Private sector rent index (Q2 2000=100)</p>

<p>Live tables relating to registered fair rents and rent determinations have also been removed from this page. The following tables have been archived and are available upon request from housing.statistics@communities.gsi.gov.uk:</p>

<p>Table 706: Rent appeals and outcomes, England, London, Rest of England, Wales
Table 711: Registered fair rents, England, Wales, London
Table 712: Registered fair rents, England, Wales, London (quarterly)
Table 713: Rent determinations by rent officers in housing benefit cases England, London, Rest of England, Wales
Table 714: Rent determinations by rent officers in housing benefit cases, England, London, Rest of England, Wales (quarterly)</p>

<p>Statistics relating to the private rental market can be found on the Valuation Office Agency website (external link). The Valuation Office Agency is also responsible for the monitoring and control of Fair Rents and provide the Electronic Rent Register.</p>

<p>The following tables relating to rent and housing benefit have also been discontinued:</p>

<p>Table 735: Rent paid before deduction of housing benefit, by tenure and age of head of household reference person
Table 736: Rent paid after deduction of housing benefit, by tenure and age of head of household reference person
Table 737: Rent paid after deduction of housing benefit, by tenure and disposable income of household reference person and partner</p>

<p>Statistics on housing benefit can be found on the Department for Work and Pensions website (external link).</p>
