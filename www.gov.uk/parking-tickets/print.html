  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can get a parking ticket from:</p>

<ul>
<li>local councils</li>
  <li>the police</li>
  <li>Transport for London</li>
  <li>private companies</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ticket types</h2>
<p>The most common type of parking ticket is a Penalty Charge Notice (<abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr>). These are issued by local councils and Transport for London.</p>

<p>In most cases, you have 28 days to <a href="paying-a-ticket" title="Parking tickets: Paying">pay</a> or <a href="challenging-a-ticket" title="Parking tickets: Challenging a ticket">challenge</a> the ticket. <a href="/pay-parking-fine" title="Pay a parking fine">Find out how to pay.</a></p>

<p>Other types of parking ticket are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed Penalty Notices (<abbr title="Fixed Penalty Notices">FPNs</abbr>): issued by the police</li>
  <li>Excess or Standard Charge Notices (<abbr title="Excess Charge Notices">ECNs</abbr> and <abbr title="Standard Charge Notices">SCNs</abbr>): issued by some local councils</li>
</ul>
<p>Private companies can issue parking tickets and may call them <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notices">PCNs</abbr>. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notices">PCNs</abbr> issued by a council.</p>

<h2>Driving points</h2>
<p>If you get a <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr>, <abbr title="Excess Charge Notice">ECN</abbr> or <abbr title="Standard Charge Notice">SCN</abbr> you won’t get any points on your driving licence.</p>

<p>You also won’t get points for most parking <abbr title="Fixed Penalty Notices">FPNs</abbr> issued by the police.</p>

  </header><h2>Penalty Charge Notices issued by local councils</h2>

<p>The cost of a Penalty Charge Notice (<abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr>) parking ticket goes up the longer you don’t <a href="/pay-parking-fine" title="Pay a parking fine">pay it:</a> </p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>If you pay within 14 days, the penalty charge is reduced by 50% (or 21 days if your car was caught on camera and the <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr> is posted to you).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you pay after 14 days but within 28 days you pay the full amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t pay within 28 days, the council will send you a reminder (called a ‘Notice to Owner’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t pay within 28 days of getting the reminder, the council may increase the penalty charge by 50%.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think the <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr> is wrong, you can <a href="challenging-a-ticket" title="Parking tickets: How to appeal">challenge</a> it.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A £60 <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr> will cost you £30 if paid within 14 days, £60 if paid within 56 days, and up to £90 if paid after 56 days.</p>
</div>

<h2>Fixed Penalty Notice (<abbr title="Fixed Penalty Notice">FPN</abbr>)</h2>
<p>You have 28 days to pay an <abbr title="Fixed Penalty Notice">FPN</abbr> or ask for a hearing in court if you want to <a href="challenging-a-ticket" title="Parking tickets: appealing">appeal</a> it. After this, the fine increases by 50%.</p>

<p>If you pay the fine, you won’t be prosecuted and no record of your offence will be kept.</p>

<p>If you ignore it, you’ll receive a court summons.</p>

<h2>Excess or Standard Charge Notice (<abbr title="Excess Charge Notice">ECN</abbr> or <abbr title="Standard Charge Notice">SCN</abbr>)</h2>
<p>You usually have 28 days to pay an <abbr title="Excess Charge Notice">ECN</abbr> or <abbr title="Standard Charge Notice">SCN</abbr>. In most cases, the fine is reduced by 50% if you pay it within 14 days.</p>

<h2>Ways to pay</h2>
<p>These are usually listed on the ticket. The main ways are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/pay-parking-fine" title="Pay a parking fine">online</a> </li>
  <li>by credit or debit card over the phone</li>
  <li>in person at your council’s customer service offices</li>
  <li>by cheque or postal order</li>
</ul></article><article id="challenging-a-ticket"><header><h1>Part 3: Challenging a ticket</h1>
  </header><h2>Penalty Charge Notice (<abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr>)</h2>
<p>If you think the ticket is wrong, you can challenge it:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>If you challenge it within 28 days, this is called an ‘informal challenge’. You need to write to your council or <a href="/appeal-parking-fine" title="Appeal a parking fine">challenge it online</a>. If you challenge it within 14 days, and the council turns you down, the council may give you more time to pay only 50% of the penalty charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the council sends you a ‘Notice to Owner’, you can challenge it. This is called a ‘formal challenge’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council has 56 days to consider your formal challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the council agrees with you, it will cancel the fine. If it turns your challenge down, it will send you a ‘Notice of Rejection’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you disagree with the ‘Notice of Rejection’, you have 28 days to appeal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can appeal to the:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.trafficpenaltytribunal.gov.uk/site/index.php" title="Traffic Penalty Tribunal">Traffic Penalty Tribunal</a> for <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notices">PCNs</abbr> issued in England (outside London)</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.patas.gov.uk/default.htm" title="Parking and Traffic Appeals Service">Parking and Traffic Appeals service (PATAS)</a> for <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notices">PCNs</abbr> issued in London</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixed Penalty Notice (<abbr title="Fixed Penalty Notice">FPN</abbr>)</h2>
<p>To challenge an <abbr title="Fixed Penalty Notice">FPN</abbr>, you need to go to a magistrate’s court. The back of the ticket will tell you how to do this. </p>

<p>You’ll be sent a summons with a date to attend a court hearing.</p>

<h2>Excess or Standard Charge Notice (<abbr title="Excess Charge Notice">ECN</abbr> and <abbr title="Standard Charge Notice">SCN</abbr>)</h2>
<p>You appeal to the local council who issued the <abbr title="Excess Charge Notice">ECN</abbr> or <abbr title="Standard Charge Notice">SCN</abbr>. Some councils let you <a href="/appeal-parking-fine" title="Appeal a parking fine">appeal online</a>.</p>
