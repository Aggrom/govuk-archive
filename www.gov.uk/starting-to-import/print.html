<p>Some businesses use <a href="/freight-forwarders" title="Freight forwarders">freight forwarding agents</a> to help them with their import procedures. </p>

</article><article id="importing-from-the-eu"><header><h1>Part 2: Importing from the EU</h1>
  </header><h2>Commodity codes</h2>
<p>You need a <a href="/finding-commodity-codes" title="Find a commodity code">commodity code</a> for all imports from other EU countries. The code classifies your goods for tax and regulations. </p>

<h2>Paying VAT for EU imports</h2>

<p>If you import from another European Union (EU) country you must add these acquisitions to your usual VAT return and <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/vat-online/submit.htm" title="submit your VAT return">submit your return online</a> every quarter. </p>

<p>If you import goods worth more than  £250,000 you’ll also have to fill in an <a href="/specialist/introduction-to-intrastat" title="Intrastat Declaration">Intrastat Declaration.</a></p>

<p>You’ll have to pay VAT at UK rates for goods you import from another EU country. </p>

<h2>Paying duty on imports from EU countries</h2>
<p>You don’t have to pay duty on goods that have been produced in the EU and are then imported to the UK. These goods are ‘in free circulation’.</p>

<p>This also covers goods from outside the EU if duty has already been paid on them.
For example, a French company imports bicycles from China and pays duty on them. They are now in free circulation and you can import them to the UK without paying further duties.</p>

</article><article id="importing-from-noneu-countries"><header><h1>Part 3: Importing from non-EU countries</h1>
  </header><h2>Commodity codes</h2>
<p>You need a <a href="/finding-commodity-codes" title="find a commodity code">commodity code</a> for all imports from non-EU countries. The code classifies your goods for tax and regulations. </p>

<h2>Import declarations to customs</h2>
<p>All imports from outside the European Union (EU) must be declared to HMRC, using <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_CL_001193" title="Form C88">form C88.</a> </p>

<p>You submit your form through <a href="/specialist/chief-trader-import-and-export-processing-system" title="CHIEF system">CHIEF</a> (Single Administrative Document).</p>

<p>You’ll need to classify your goods according to the <a href="/trade-tariff" title="UK Trade Tariff">UK Trade Tariff</a> which also lists the duty charges, tax, custom rules and paperwork for imports from non-EU countries. </p>

<p>You can use a use <a href="/freight-forwarders" title="Freight forwarders">freight forwarding agent</a> to make the declaration for you. </p>

<p>If your goods go through another EU country before coming to the UK, your supplier or the business responsible for transport must make an Entry Summary Declaration in the country. Check that this is done because in some cases the receiving business can be responsible for it. </p>

<p>In some cases you can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_009345&amp;propertyType=document" title="apply for simplified import procedures">apply for simplified import procedures</a> through Community transit.</p>

<h2>Paying duty and VAT on imports from non-EU countries</h2>
<p>You normally have to pay duty on goods imported from non-EU countries when they’re first brought into the EU. </p>

<p>The amount of duty you pay depends on how the goods are classified under the UK Trade Tariff and how they’ll be used. </p>

<p>You may be able to apply for <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000180&amp;propertyType=document" title="reduced or zero rate duty">reduced or zero rate duty</a> for goods from certain countries as long as you can prove their origin.  </p>

<p>Your goods will not be released by customs until you’ve paid all duty and UK VAT. </p>

<p>It is possible to import goods from non-EU countries without paying duty as long as they stay in a ‘bonded warehouse.’ These warehouses are places exempt from duty. For example, you could import goods from the USA, store them in a bonded warehouse in the UK and move them into a bonded warehouse in Spain without paying duty.  </p>
