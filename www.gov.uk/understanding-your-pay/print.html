</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>When you start work, your employer should tell you how much you’ll be paid and how often. They should also tell you:</p>

<ul>
<li>the day or date you’ll be paid, eg each Friday or the last day of the month</li>
  <li>how you’ll be paid, eg cash, cheque or bank transfer</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re an employee (not a contractor or a freelance worker), you have the <a href="/payslips-your-rights" title="right to a payslip">right to a payslip</a>, which shows your wages and any deductions like tax or trade union subscriptions.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re not sure whether your an employee or a worker, read the information on <a href="/employment-status" title="your employment status">your employment status</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You might need to know how to work out your weekly pay if you have to claim payments for redundancy or compensation from your employer.</p>

<h2>Part-time workers</h2>
<p>If you’re a part-time worker, you must get at least the same hourly pay rate as a full-time worker doing a similar job.</p>


</article><article id="working-out-your-pay"><header><h1>Part 2: Working out your pay</h1>
  </header><p>Knowing how to work out your weekly pay is important because it’s used to work out how much you should get for:</p>

<ul>
<li>redundancy pay and pay during time off for job-hunting if you’re made redundant</li>
  <li>pay during your notice period</li>
  <li>holiday pay </li>
  <li>guarantee pay for work (you get this if your employer can’t provide you with work, but your contract says they have to pay you anyway)</li>
  <li>compensation awarded by Employment Tribunals</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>What you’re entitled to depends on <a href="/employment-status" title="your work status">your work status</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re paid weekly and your pay doesn’t vary, you don’t need to calculate your weekly pay. </p>

<p>If your pay varies or you’re not paid weekly, you have to use a 12-week period for working it out.</p>

<h3>The 12-week period</h3>

<p>This is where you work out your weekly pay by getting an average figure for a 12-week period. The period of time you use varies if you’re calculating your pay for a specific reason.</p>

<h3>Redundancy</h3>

<p>To work out your pay during time off for job-hunting if you’re being made redundant, use the 12-week period leading up to the day you got your redundancy notice.</p>

<h3>Notice pay</h3>

<p>If you want to know what your notice pay should be, use the 12-weeks leading up to the first day of the notice period.</p>

<h3>Paid annual leave</h3>

<p>Work this out using the 12 weeks leading up to your holiday.</p>

<h3>Guarantee payments</h3>

<p>Use the 12 weeks leading up to when your payment is due. If you no longer work for that employer, use the last 12 weeks of your employment with them.</p>

<p>If you’ve worked for your employer for less than 12 weeks, you should be allowed to calculate your average weekly pay using:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of hours you would have worked</li>
  <li>the hours of other workers doing a similar job for your employer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working out your weekly figure</h3>

<p>Add up the total amount of pay for the period and divide it by 12 to get the weekly figure. You do this even if you’ve had to use a period of more than 12 weeks.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Bonuses can also be included - read the information on how to <a href="pay-calculations-if-you-work-shifts-or-get-bonuses" title="work out your pay with bonuses">work out your pay with bonuses</a> for help.</p>
</div>

<h2>Overtime</h2>

<p>If your contract says your employer has to pay you overtime, this can be included in your calculations.</p>

<h2>Work done for a previous employer</h2>

<p>You can include pay for work done for a previous employer if you’re calculating your average weekly pay and you didn’t have a gap in employment when you changed jobs.</p>

<h2>If you don’t have normal working hours</h2>

<p>If you do shift or rota work, working out your weekly pay can be more complicated - read the advice on <a href="pay-calculations-if-you-work-shifts-or-get-bonuses" title="calculations if you work shifts">calculations if you work shifts</a>.</p>

</article><article id="pay-calculations-if-you-work-shifts-or-get-bonuses"><header><h1>Part 3: Pay calculations if you work shifts or get bonuses</h1>
  </header><p>If your pay or working hours vary from week to week, the calculations for working out your weekly pay are more complicated.</p>

<h2>If your pay varies</h2>

<p>Pay can vary depending on the amount of work you do, because of:</p>

<ul>
<li>bonuses</li>
  <li>commission</li>
  <li>‘piece-work’ - where you’re paid by the amount of work you do, rather than by the hour</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the case, to work out your weekly pay you need to work out your average hourly rate over a 12-week period. </p>

<p>To do this, work out your total pay for the 12 weeks first. You can include overtime and bonuses. There are special calculations for bonuses.</p>

<h2>Quarterly bonuses</h2>

<p>If you get a quarterly bonus you can include a proportion of it in your calculations. Here’s what to do:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Divide the amount by 13 (the number of weeks in a quarter of a year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply this figure by 12 (the number of weeks your pay is averaged across).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>If you get a quarterly bonus of £260:</p>

<ul>
<li>divide £260 by 13 weeks = £20</li>
  <li>multiply £20 by 12 weeks = £240</li>
</ul>
<p>You can include a bonus of £240 as part of your 12-week total.</p>
</div>

<h2>Annual bonuses</h2>

<p>If you get an annual bonus here’s what you need to do.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Divide the amount by 52 (the number of weeks in a year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply this by 12.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>If you get an annual bonus of £5,200:</p>

<ul>
<li>divide £5,200 by 52 weeks = £100 per week</li>
  <li>multiply £100 by 12 weeks = £1,200</li>
</ul>
<p>You can include a bonus of £1,200 as part of your 12-week total.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you’ve worked out your total pay for the 12-week period, work out the average hourly rate by dividing the total by the number of hours you worked in the 12-week period. </p>

<p>To work out your weekly wage, multiply your hourly rate by the average number of hours you worked each week in the 12-week period.</p>

<h2>If you do shift or rota work</h2>

<p>Your week’s pay will be the average number of hours you work at an average pay rate over a 12-week period.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Your pay is £6 per hour and you work 3, 9-hour shifts, then you have 3 days off. </p>

<p>On weekends you’re paid £9 per hour. At the start of the 12-week period, your first day at work is a Monday. Here’s how you work out your pay.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Work out how many hours you did over the 12-week period (42, 9-hour shifts = 378 hours).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide this by 12 to work out your average weekly hours: 378 divided by 12 = 31.5 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate your pay for the weekday shifts. You’d have worked 30 weekday 9-hour shifts at £6 per hour. 30 shifts x 9 hours = 270 hours. Multiply this by £6 to get the total you were paid for your weekday shifts: £1620.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide £1620 by 12 to get the weekly figure: £135.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate your pay for weekends. You’d have worked 12 weekend 9-hour shifts at £9 per hour. 12 shifts x 9 hours = 108 hours. Multiply this by £9 to get the weekend total: £972</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide this by 12 to get the weekly figure: £81 per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the weekday and weekend figures together: £135 + £81 = £216. This is your weekly rate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

</article><article id="performancerelated-pay"><header><h1>Part 4: Performance-related pay</h1>
  </header><p>If you get performance-related pay your employer should base it on clear, measurable targets - they should tell you about these.</p>

<p>There are 2 main types of performance pay:</p>

<ul>
<li>short-term schemes, like bonus payments or sales commission</li>
  <li>long-term schemes, like company shares</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you have problems</h2>

<p>If you don’t get a bonus or commission you’re owed and you think there’s been a mistake:</p>

<ul>
<li>speak to your employer to see if there’s been a misunderstanding</li>
  <li>ask them set out in writing how they’ve calculated your pay</li>
  <li>keep copies of any letters and notes of any meetings</li>
</ul>
<p>If a bonus or commission is included in your contract, non-payment is a breach of contract - read the advice on <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="workplace disputes">workplace disputes</a> if you need help. </p>

<p>Also, non-payment of bonuses may be covered legally under:</p>

<ul>
<li>unlawful deductions from wages (eg you’re entitled to payment but it hasn’t been given)</li>
  <li>unlawful discrimination (your employer must not discriminate against particular groups, for example giving smaller bonuses to women) </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also get advice from <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461" title="ACAS (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)"><abbr title="the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">ACAS</abbr> (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service),</a> <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm#searchbox" title="Citizens Advice">Citizens Advice</a> or your trade union representative.</p>


</article><article id="deductions-from-your-pay"><header><h1>Part 5: Deductions from your pay</h1>
  </header><p>Your employer isn’t allowed to make deductions unless:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s required or allowed by law, eg National Insurance, income tax or student loan repayments</li>
  <li>you agree in writing </li>
  <li>your contract says they can</li>
  <li>there’s a statutory payment due to a public authority </li>
  <li>you haven’t worked due to taking part in a strike or industrial action</li>
  <li>there’s been an earlier overpayment of wages or expenses</li>
  <li>it’s a result of a court order</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>A deduction can’t reduce your pay below the <a href="/national-minimum-wage-rates" title="National Minimum Wage">National Minimum Wage</a> rate, even if you’ve agreed to it.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you work in retail (eg shops, restaurants)</h3>

<p>Your employer can’t take more than 10% from your gross pay (pay before tax and National Insurance) each pay period to cover any shortfalls.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>There’s a shortfall of £50 in your till and your employer wants to deduct this from your earnings. </p>

<p>You’re paid £250 gross per week. Your employer can take 10% of your gross earnings, which is £25.</p>

<p>They must only take £25 one week and then make another deduction from your next pay cheque for £25.</p>

<p>If you leave your job, they can take the full amount owed from your final pay</p>
</div>

<h2>If you haven’t been paid in full</h2>

<p>Speak to your employer first to try to sort the problem informally. </p>

<p>If this doesn’t work, talk to <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461" title="ACAS (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)"><abbr title="the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">ACAS</abbr> (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service),</a> <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm#searchbox" title="Citizens Advice">Citizens Advice</a> or your trade union representative.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You have the right to go to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment Tribunal">Employment Tribunal</a> to get your money.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you quit your job</h2>

<p>Check your contract to see if your employer is allowed to withhold your pay. Normally you’re entitled to be paid everything you earned up to the point you finished.</p>

<p>If you’re forced to resign as a result of your employer refusing to pay you, you might be able to make a constructive dismissal claim in an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment Tribunal">Employment Tribunal</a>.</p>
