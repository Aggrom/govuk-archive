</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Employers might monitor workers. This could be done in various ways, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>CCTV</li>
  <li>drug testing</li>
  <li>bag searches</li>
  <li>checking a worker’s emails or the websites they look at</li>
</ul>
<p>Data protection law covers any monitoring that involves taking data, images or drug testing.</p>

<p>If workers are unhappy about being monitored, they can check their staff handbook or contract to see if the employer is allowed to do this. </p>

<p>If they’re not, the worker might be able to resign and claim unfair (‘constructive’) dismissal. But this is a last resort - they should try to sort the problem out first - read the advice to help <a href="/solve-workplace-dispute" title="solve a workplace dispute">solve a workplace dispute</a>.</p>

<h2>Searches</h2>

<p>Employers should have a written policy on searching. Searches should:</p>

<ul>
<li>respect privacy</li>
  <li>be done by a member of the same sex</li>
  <li>be done with a witness present</li>
</ul>
<p>If a search or drug test is badly handled, workers might have a claim for discrimination, assault or false imprisonment. </p>

</article><article id="drug-testing"><header><h1>Part 2: Drug testing</h1>
  </header><p>Employers have to have consent if they want to test for drugs. Usually this is when they have a full contractual health and safety policy, which should be in the contract or staff handbook.</p>

<p>Employers should:</p>

<ul>
<li>limit testing to employees that need to be tested</li>
  <li>ensure the tests are random</li>
  <li>not single out particular employees for testing unless this is justified by the nature of their jobs</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Workers can’t be made to take a drugs test but if they refuse when the employer has good grounds for testing, they may face disciplinary action.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="email-cctv-and-other-monitoring"><header><h1>Part 3: Email, CCTV and other monitoring</h1>
  </header><p>Employers must explain the amount of monitoring clearly in the staff handbook or contract. They should tell workers:</p>

<ul>
<li>if they’re being monitored</li>
  <li>what counts as a reasonable number of personal emails and phone calls</li>
  <li>if personal emails and calls are not allowed</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of monitoring could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>looking at which websites workers have visited</li>
  <li>CCTV in the building</li>
  <li>checking workers’ bags as they leave</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers are not allowed to monitor workers everywhere (not in the toilet, for example). If they don’t respect this they could be in breach of the <a href="/data-protection" title="data protection">Data Protection Act</a>.</p>
