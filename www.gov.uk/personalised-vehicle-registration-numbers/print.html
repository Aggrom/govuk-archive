</article><article id="assigning-a-personalised-number-to-a-vehicle"><header><h1>Part 3: Assigning a personalised number to a vehicle</h1>
  </header><p>If you’ve bought a personalised registration number, you’ll need to apply to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> to assign it to a vehicle. It can only be used on a vehicle that’s registered (or about to be registered), taxed and used in Great Britain.</p>

<h2>How to assign your personalised number to a vehicle</h2>

<p>Send your application to your <a href="/dvla-offices" title="Find your nearest DVLA office">nearest <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> office.</a></p>

<p>You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>the V750 certificate of entitlement or V778 retention document signed by the person named on the top of the certificate</li>
  <li>the registration certificate (V5C) or the new keeper supplement with a completed V62 ‘application for a vehicle registration certificate V5C’ form</li>
  <li>an MOT test certificate for cars and motorcycles over 3 years old (1 year for heavy goods vehicles)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">

  <li>make the vehicle look newer than it actually is</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> 
You can’t put a ‘07’ registration number onto a 2003 registered vehicle, but you could choose any prefix range from ‘A’ to ‘T’.</p>
</div>

<h2>Adding a nominee or taxing your vehicle when you assign the number</h2>

<p>You can add a nominee when assigning the registration number by:</p>

<ul>
<li>completing section 2 of the V750 or V778</li>
  <li>enclosing the £25 nominee fee by cheque or postal order payable to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> (do not send cash)</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>If they don’t need to inspect your vehicle, they should approve your application within 2 weeks and send you:</p>

<ul>
<li>a new tax disc showing the new registration number</li>
