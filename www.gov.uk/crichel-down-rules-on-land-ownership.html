<p>The Crichel Down Rules require government departments, under certain circumstances, to offer back surplus land to the former owner or the former owner’s successors at the current market value. The Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) is obliged to consider the potential application of the Crichel Down Rules to all of its surplus sites.</p>

<p>If the rules apply and no exceptions from the rules are applicable to a site then <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> will offer that site (or the relevant parts of it) back to former owners, or their successors, ahead of any offer to the open market, in accordance with the rules.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is currently in the process of reviewing the application of the rules to some sites and will be obliged to complete that process in full for that site before any offers from the open market can be considered.</p>

<p>The publication of a site on this website is not intended to indicate nor serve as any conclusion or view as to the application of the rules to a site.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compulsory-purchase-and-the-crichel-down-rules-circular-06-2004">latest Crichel Down Rules</a> were published on 31 October 2004 under part 2 of ODPM Circular 06/2004.</p>

<h2 id="advertised-properties">Advertised properties</h2>

<p>Most major disposals appear on our website or more detailed information can be obtained from the regional office. We do not produce a publication of all UK sites for sale. </p>

<h2 id="how-the-dio-sells-the-ministry-of-defence-mods-surplus-land-and-property">How the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> sells the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>)’s surplus land and property</h2>

<p>As a government department, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> works within Treasury guidelines when selling property assets. It is usual policy to sell surplus property on the open market by tender or by auction. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> may instruct Agents to act on its behalf when selling land and property but <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> will also sell sites direct. Sites suitable for redevelopment are generally sold with the benefit of planning permission and/or with clawback/overage provisions in order to optimise receipts for the benefit of the taxpayer.</p>

<p>Due to the high interest in surplus property, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> does not provide UK wide or regional lists of properties for sale. For more detailed information on specific surplus properties please contact the appropriate <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Regional Office with your request. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is under an obligation to dispose of property at market value unless there are very exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="sale-of-individual-buildings">Sale of individual buildings</h3>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> rarely sells bunkers (sometimes known as Uniters). Occasionally the Home Office has such facilities for sale. </p>

<p>Surplus portable buildings are sold by an agency of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> - the Disposal Services Authority (<abbr title="Disposal Services Authority">DSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you have seen an empty <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> property and would like advice about its availability, please contact the appropriate <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Regional Office with details of the property, including its address, description and grid reference if possible. A <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> representative will then investigate if it is <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> property and if applicable check its availability and advise on the method of sale.</p>

<h3 id="sale-of-mod-estates">Sale of <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> estates</h3>

<p><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s policy on estate sizes is that an estate should be no larger than necessary to meet operational needs of the Armed Forces. To this end, the overall size of the estate is kept under continual review and the rationalisation of land holdings and timely sale of surplus property remains a key priority.</p>

<p>The majority of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s Married Quarters (<abbr title="Married Quarters">MQs</abbr>) (now known as Service Family Accommodation) in England &amp; Wales were sold to Annington Property Limited in 1996 and then leased back by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. As properties become surplus to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s requirements, they are surrendered to Annington Homes Ltd. who in turn, sell or lease them individually to the public.</p>

<p>Occasionally <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> sells residential property in England and Wales directly to the public. Information about the property <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> currently has for sale, can be obtained from the appropriate <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Regional Office.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has retained ownership of the residential <abbr title="Married Quarter">MQ</abbr> estate in Scotland and <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> normally sells any surplus <abbr title="Married Quarters">MQs</abbr> directly to the public. For information about the properties <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> currently have for sale, please view on the appropriate webpages or contact the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> office in Scotland.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="Married Quarters">MQs</abbr> attracted a legal charge to protect the discount given to service personnel. This has now expired. If purchasers or mortgage lenders specifically want to have the legal charge lifted, they should contact the appropriate <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> regional office who can make the necessary arrangements for a fee to cover our legal costs.</p>

<h3 id="sale-of-pieces-of-land">Sale of pieces of land</h3>

<p>If you believe <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> owns a small piece of land which you are interested in purchasing, contact the appropriate <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Regional Office with details of the area of land, including its address, description and grid reference if possible. A <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> representative will then investigate if it is <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> property and check availability and if applicable, advise on the method of sale.</p>

<h3 id="sale-of-property-overseas">Sale of property overseas</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> does not generally own land or property overseas, any land or property that is occupied by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, is provided by the host country. Upon <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> vacating an overseas site, it is handed back to the host country.</p>

<h3 id="contamination">Contamination</h3>

<p>All <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> properties for disposal that have been used for a military purpose ie chemicals or explosive storage, would normally have a Land Quality Assessment (<abbr title="Land Quality Assessment">LQA</abbr>), to assess the level of any contamination. The prospective purchaser would be fully informed prior to the sale.</p>

<h3 id="clawbackoverage-requirements">Clawback/overage requirements</h3>

<p>The standard clawback clause, together with worked examples and guidance notes, is available in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/33578/20120517PI08_11ClawbackReviewRevisedFinalU.pdf">Policy Instruction 02/09</a>. It is strongly recommended that prospective purchasers read and understand it.</p>

<h3 id="affordable-housing">Affordable housing</h3>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> works closely with the Local Planning Authority whose policies determine the level of need for affordable housing allocated and the Homes and Communities Agency (<abbr title="Homes and Communities Agency">HCA</abbr>), the regeneration agency of the government for England and Wales. </p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> also works closely with the Welsh Development Agency, the Scottish and Northern Ireland structures and/or Registered Social Landlords if they express an interest in a particular site. However, Treasury rules provide that unless there are exceptional circumstances sites must be transferred at market value.</p>

<h3 id="freedom-of-information-act">Freedom of Information Act</h3>

<p>Under the Freedom of Information (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) Act, everyone has the right to access information held by the public sector subject with clearly defined exemptions and conditions. There is a requirement to consider discretionary disclosure in the public interest even when an exemption applies. There is also a duty to publish information.</p>
