<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The European Fisheries Fund (<abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>) provides financial assistance to help fishermen and vessel managers implement the latest reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy. It supports improvements to fishing vessels and fisheries practices to help move towards a more sustainable future.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-european-fisheries-fund">What is the European Fisheries Fund?</h2>

<p>The government has set aside approximately £38 million from the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> between 2007-13 to help the fisheries industry adapt to changing requirements under the Common Fisheries Policy. This funding is broken down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Axis 1: measures for the adaptation of the European Community fishing fleet</li>
  <li>Axis 2: measures for investments in aquaculture and processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products</li>
  <li>Axis 3: measures of common interest</li>
  <li>Axis 4: measures of the sustainable development of fisheries areas</li>
  <li>Axis 5: technical assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/eff_apply.htm">application forms for the different <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> Axes on the Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>The types of project eligible for grant aid through the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>improvements to non-mandatory onboard safety</li>
  <li>modernising fishing vessels - for example, to reduce discards, improve gear selectivity, improve on-board hygiene and minimize environmental impact</li>
  <li>improvements to product quality</li>
  <li>marketing of fisheries products</li>
  <li>improvements to processing and port facilities</li>
  <li>support for the diversification of aquaculture</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> programme is competitive, and only projects which most effectively meet its aims will be awarded a grant. Grants are not awarded for projects that will increase fishing efforts.</p>

<p>Any work that starts before a decision has been made on an application is automatically not eligible for a grant.</p>

<p>For advice on the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> or to find out if your project is eligible, you can call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505, email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a> or write to:</p>

<h2 id="applying-to-the-eff-for-smaller-projects">Applying to the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> for smaller projects</h2>

<p>To apply for funding under the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> of less than £100,000, you should submit the relevant application form to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>. The application form you should use should match the Axis of the fund you wish to apply to. </p>

<p>For more information on the different Axes of the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, see the following page in this guide on ‘What is the European Fisheries Fund?’</p>

<p>Unless you are applying for less than £20,000, you should also send a simple statement of the business justification for your project, covering the following five questions. Justify your answer as much as possible, with perhaps several paragraphs under each question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you consider any alternative way of meeting your basic project needs?</li>
  <li>If finance became even tighter in general, could you do anything useful by spending only part of your total project cost?</li>
  <li>Have you investigated full commercial funding for your project?</li>
  <li>Are you able to make a rough prediction of the effect of the project on your gross profit?</li>
  <li>Apart from profit, are there other benefits of the investment, including those to your workers, the industry, the wider community or the environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>You should make sure that you describe all the costs and benefits of your project without double counting.</p>

<p>For advice on applying to the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, you should contact the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<h2 id="applying-to-the-eff-for-larger-projects">Applying to the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> for larger projects</h2>

<p>To apply for funding under the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> for more than £100,000, you should submit the relevant application form to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>. The application form you should use should match the Axis of the fund you wish to apply to. </p>

<p>For more information on the Axis, see the following page in this guide on ‘What is the European Fisheries Fund?’</p>

<p>The same criteria apply as for smaller projects - you will need need to provide answers to the following five questions in your application for funding. Justify your answer as much as possible, with perhaps several paragraphs under each question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you consider any alternative way of meeting your basic project needs?</li>
  <li>If finance became even tighter in general, could you do anything useful by spending only part of your total project cost?</li>
  <li>Have you investigated full commercial funding for your project?</li>
  <li>Are you able to make a rough prediction of the effect of the project on your gross profit?</li>
  <li>Apart from profit, are there other benefits of the investment, including those to your workers, the industry, the wider community or the environment?</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as answering these five questions, you should also cover the following in full:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rationale for the project: a statement of your general requirement for funding, independent of the actual solution you plan to adopt. This should be supported by evidence, meeting <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound">SMART</abbr> objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound) wherever possible</li>
  <li>Options: you must submit a formal investment appraisal, including a statement of all the possible options that could satisfy at least your minimum requirements. All options should then be subject to at least a cursory cost-benefit assessment</li>
  <li>Additionality: why your project would not go ahead without <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> support, and evidence that you can afford to pay for the project up front before funding can be claimed</li>
  <li>Production efficiency: how your project will increase the productivity of the UK fisheries sector</li>
  <li>Labour market effects: how your project will support employment in the sector</li>
  <li>Other costs and benefits: for example, environmental benefits, increased health and safety or improvements to the local tourism industry</li>
  <li>Risk: major risks to your project and how you plan to mitigate these. Large projects may compile a risk register attempting to quantify risks, involving pre- and post- mitigation estimates.</li>
  <li>Feasibility, quotes and contract arrangements.</li>
  <li>Project management: how you will plan, resource, manage and appraise the project.</li>
  <li>Legal compliance: including environmental and health and safety legislation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are submitting an application for funding for a project worth more than £100,000 you will also need to submit a business case with your application. See the page on ‘writing a business case and investment appraisal for European Fisheries Fund funding’</p>

<p>For further advice, call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-business-case-and-investment-appraisal-for-the-eff">Writing a business case and investment appraisal for the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you are applying to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> for funding through the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> for more than £100,000, you will need to submit a brief business case (around five pages is recommended) and a simple investment appraisal, to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> along with the relevant application form.</p>

<p>For substantial applications of more than £1 million you should submit a developed business case of at least 10 pages, with separate spreadsheet calculation, and a detailed investment appraisal along with the relevant application form.</p>

<p>For information on the different Axes, see the following page on ‘What is the European Fisheries Fund?’</p>

<p>Your business case should be a summary of all the issues that have been addressed in your application. See the guides on ‘applying to the European Fisheries Fund for smaller projects’ and ‘applying to the European Fisheries Fund for larger projects’.</p>

<p>The case should be able to support your project on a standalone basis. Ranges or estimates should only be used where there is significant uncertainty.</p>

<h3 id="investment-appraisals">Investment appraisals</h3>

<p>An investment appraisal is a cost-benefit assessment of all the possible options.</p>

<p>If it has proved possible to quantify the key economic benefits in your case, you can calculate a present value of these benefits according to the 
<a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/green_book_complete.pdf">Green Book</a> convention. This can then be set against present value costs (sometimes called a discounted cash flow calculation), and a cost benefit ratio - or true net present value - can be calculated.</p>

<p>You should then add in any non-quantified elements and wider costs and benefits to form an investment appraisal.</p>

<p>If you are applying to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> for funding under the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, you should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should make the calculation over the expected life of the investment (the appraisal period) and include both initial and recurring costs - typically running costs. Running costs should be all the additional costs associated with the investment - eg labour, maintenance and utilities.</li>
  <li>Depreciation, cost of capital and profit should be excluded from the present value calculation. There are no exceptions to this rule.</li>
  <li>The proportion of cost that is being grant-supported is irrelevant to the value for money calculation. The assessment is for the project as a whole.</li>
  <li>Capital and running costs expressed in real terms (constant or current prices) should be discounted at a cumulative 3.5% per annum to reflect the social rate of time preference (for very long-term projects a lower rate is applicable after thirty years). The same procedure is done for quantified benefits over the appraisal period.</li>
</ul>
<p>For advice, call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="timescales-for-eff-applications">Timescales for <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> applications</h2>

<p>Once your <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> funding application form is received, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team has 15 days to tell you whether your project is eligible, or to ask you for further information.</p>

<p>Depending on how complicated your project is, they might need to ask for expert advice before assessing your application. This can take up to 4 weeks. Once they have the relevant expert advice they will write to you within 2 weeks and tell you whether your project is eligible, or ask you to provide more information.</p>

<p>If your application is considered complex, it will normally go to the selection panel. Your local area facilitator or the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team will be able to advise you whether this is likely to happen.</p>

<p>You can call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2505 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a>.</p>
