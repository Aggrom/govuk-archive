<h2 id="what-is-the-european-fisheries-fund">What is the European Fisheries Fund?</h2>

<p>The government has set aside approximately £38 million from the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> between 2007 and 2013 to help the fisheries industry adapt to changing requirements under the Common Fisheries Policy. This funding is broken down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Axis 1: Measures for the adaptation of the European Community fishing fleet</li>
  <li>Axis 2: Measures for investments in aquaculture and processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products</li>
  <li>Axis 3: Measures of common interest</li>
  <li>Axis 4: Measures of the sustainable development of fisheries areas</li>
</ul>
<p>The Axis 4 programme is delivered through fisheries local action groups (FLAGs) who represent different area. These FLAGs have been set up in six areas in England, covering around 20 per cent of the English coastline. <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/eff_axis4.htm">Read more about Axis 4 on the Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h2 id="who-can-apply">Who can apply?</h2>

<p>You, as the applicant, must sign the application form, even if you had help completing it as you will be responsible for making sure that all of the terms and conditions of the grant are met.</p>

<p>The different funding streams are available to different people or sectors. For example, Axis 1 is available to vessel owners in the private sector, but Axis 2 aquaculture projects are available to micro, small or medium sized in the public or private sector.</p>

<h2 id="when-can-you-apply">When can you apply?</h2>

<p>You can apply at any time until 31 December 2013, which is the end of the programme. If your application is for a large amount of money or is more complicated, your form and business case may have to be assessed by a selection panel. The panels are usually held 3 times a year.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> may have to close the programme earlier if the allocated funds have been used up.</p>

<h2 id="what-things-may-be-eligible-for-a-grant">What things may be eligible for a grant?</h2>

<p>The kinds of projects that are eligible for a grant vary depending on the axis.</p>

<ul>
<li>Axis 1 is aimed at improvements to on board safety, working conditions, hygience, product quality, selectivity of fishing gear, energy efficiency and engine replacement</li>
  <li>Axis 2 is aimed at investments in aquaculture and processing, and for marketing of fishery and aquaculture products so may include buildings, equipment, fees, infrastructure and vehicles</li>
  <li>Axis 3 is aimed at common interests so may include advertising and promotion, equipment, products not intended for human consumption and VAT</li>
</ul>
<p>Grants are not awarded for projects that will increase fishing efforts.</p>

<p>Any work that starts before a decision has been made on an application is automatically not eligible for a grant.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-grant-will-i-get">How much grant will I get?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> programme is competitive, and only projects that most effectively meet its aims will be awarded a grant.</p>

<p>You will receive a percentage of the total eligible cost of your project if you are successful. The amount you receive depends on your type or project, and your location. The different axes have different requirements both in terms of minimum and maximum grants you can apply for, and the percentages available.</p>

<ul>
<li>Axis 1 has a £500 minimum and £60,000 maximum (except engine replacements where the maximum is £100,000), and the maximum percentage you will receive wil be between 20 and 60 per cent</li>
  <li>Axis 2 has a £400 minimum and three maximums depending on the type of project, and the maximum percentage you will receive will be between 80 and 100 per cent, 20 and 40 per cent, and 20 and 40 per cent</li>
  <li>Axis 3 has 5 different kinds of projects with their own minimums and maximums, and different maximum percentages depending on the applicant (public or private), and location (Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly or the rest of England)</li>
</ul>
<p>For advice on the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> or to find out if your project is eligible, you can call the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2694 or 0191 376 2676, email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a> or write to:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-for-funding">How to apply for funding</h2>

<p>You should submit the relevant application form to the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>. You should use the application form that matches the appropriate axis of the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your application must include a detailed business case that shows that your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>has quantified outputs and clear and attainable targets</li>
  <li>will provide an additional and sustainable benefit to the fishing industry</li>
  <li>has a justified need for grant</li>
  <li>will provide good value for money</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a full description of your project</li>
  <li>why the work is needed</li>
  <li>the benefits of the project</li>
  <li>financial, environmental and other benefits</li>
  <li>a cost-benefit analysis</li>
  <li>an analysis of quotes</li>
  <li>the results you expect from the project</li>
  <li>how you will monitor the project</li>
  <li>how you will manage risks to delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>Smaller projects just require a simple statement of costs and benefits with the appropriate number of quotes along with copies of your company accounts will be sufficient for the projects involving:</p>

<ul>
<li>improvements to working conditions</li>
  <li>safety equipment additional to that required by Maritime and Coastguard Agency rules</li>
  <li>facilities to maximise fish quality where the costs are less than £1,250</li>
  <li>the adoption of sustainable catching methods where the costs are less than £1,250 (in this case, we will also need the details of your current and future fishing position)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should make sure that you describe all the costs and benefits of your project without double counting.</p>

<p>For advice on applying to the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, you should contact the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> Business Relations Team on 0191 376 2694 or 0191 376 2676 or email them at <a href="mailto:eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk">eff.projects@marinemanagement.org.uk</a></p>

<p>The offer letter sets out details of the conditions of the grant and any agreed performance targets and outputs for the project. You must comply with the conditions along with details of eligible expenditure to allow us to pay your grant claims.</p>

<p>There are some general conditions that apply to all grants, as well as conditions specific to your project. <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/forms/eff/conditions.pdf">Read the general conditions of <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> grant for projects in England on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF 93KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Your application will be treated as commercially confidential throughout the assessment stage. Once approved, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will make some details public – the name of the applicant, the amount approved, the nature of the project. By accepting the offer you are agreeing that this information can be made public.</p>

<h3 id="supporting-documentation-for-eff-claims">Supporting documentation for <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> claims</h3>

<p>All claims must be accompanied by a progress report. If the progress report for your project is not satisfactory, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> may not be able to pay your claim.</p>

<p>You must submit the originals of all invoices and other sales dockets in support of each item listed in Section 2(c)1 of the claim form – the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will retain all original documents. If you cannot, for a legitimate reason, provide originals, you must provide copies which are certified by the supplier as true copies of the originals.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> requires a BACs remittance or bank statement showing payment of each of the invoices in order to verify payment of the items.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> also ask you to number the invoices in the order they are listed. You will be required to demonstrate that services or goods are costed at market rates and that documentation has a probative value similar to receipts that will satisfy the scheme’s auditors for payments in kind.</p>

<p>Some expenditure incurred in non-capital projects may not involve invoices. In such cases, you must provide appropriate documentation to confirm that the expenditure was incurred and defrayed, such as rail tickets for attendance at trade fairs.
For claims in respect of structural work, a statement from an independent architect or surveyor on letter headed paper is required, confirming that the work has been carried out in accordance with the terms of the original application. Where the work has not been carried out in accordance with such terms, give reasons for the differences and refer to dates on which modifications were authorised by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>.</p>
