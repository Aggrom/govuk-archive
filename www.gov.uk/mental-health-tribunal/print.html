  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply to the mental health tribunal if you disagree with a decision to ‘section’ or detain someone in a psychiatric hospital.</p>

<p>The tribunal can release (‘discharge’) the patient or recommend they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>transferred to a local hospital</li>
  <li>considered for treatment in the community</li>
</ul>
<p>The patient is sometimes allowed some time out of the hospital, to see if they’re ready for life in the community.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The tribunal deals with cases in England and Wales. <a href="http://www.mhtscotland.gov.uk/mhts/Home/Welcome_to_the_Mental_Health_Tribunal" title="Scotland" rel="external">Scotland</a> has its own tribunal.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other applications</h2>

<p>You can also apply to the tribunal if you disagree with:</p>

<ul>
<li>a community treatment order</li>
  <li>the conditions placed on a discharge from the hospital</li>
</ul>
<h2>When you can apply</h2>

<p>You can apply at different times, depending on how the patient was detained.</p>

<p>The rules are complicated, but generally the time-limits are:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Type of detention</th>
      <th>Period of detention</th>
      <th>When you can appeal</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Admitted for assessment</td>
      <td>Up to 28 days</td>
      <td>Within first 14 days</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Admitted for treatment</td>
      <td>Up to 6 months, but can be renewed</td>
      <td>Once every 6 months</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Ordered by court</td>
      <td>Up to 6 months, but can be renewed</td>
      <td>After 6 months, then once every 6 months</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The tribunal will automatically look at the cases of patients that have not been reviewed for some time. These are called ‘referrals’.</p>

<h2>Help and advice</h2>

<p>Patients are entitled to <a href="/legal-aid" title="legal aid">legal aid</a> and can get free legal representation.</p>

<p>If you’re a relative of the patient, you can represent yourself or get legal help.</p>

<h2>Before the hearing</h2>

<p>The tribunal’s doctor will examine the patient before the hearing, and the tribunal will send you copies of any reports about the patient.</p>

<p>Your legal representative may ask for an independent psychiatric report.</p>

<h2>Who will be at the hearing</h2>

<p>Hearings are usually held in the hospital and attended by:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 tribunal members (including the tribunal doctor)</li>
  <li>the patient</li>
  <li>their hospital doctor, ward nurse and social worker</li>
</ul>
<p>You can bring a legal representative and a relative.</p>

<p>Your representative may also arrange for witnesses or experts to attend, to speak for the patient.</p>

<h2>What happens at the hearing</h2>

<p>The doctor, nurse and social worker usually give evidence first.</p>

<p>The patient can also give evidence, if they wish.</p>

<p>You, or your legal representative, will have the chance to ask questions.</p>

<p>The tribunal normally makes a decision at the end of the hearing on whether the patient should be discharged.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The tribunal sometimes has to move the hearing to another date if it needs more information or reports.</p>
</div>
