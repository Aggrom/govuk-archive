  </header><h2>Statutory Paternity Leave</h2>

<p>Eligible employees get either 1 or 2 weeks consecutive leave - even if they have more than one child (eg twins). </p>

<p>Leave can’t start before the birth. The start date must be one of the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>the actual date of birth</li>
  <li>an agreed number of days after the birth</li>
  <li>an agreed number of days after the expected week of childbirth</li>
</ul>
<p>Leave must finish within 56 days of the birth (or due date if the baby is early). The start and end dates are different if the employee is <a href="/paternity-leave-pay-employees/adoption" title="Adoption">adopting</a>.</p>

<h2>Statutory Paternity Pay</h2>

<p>Statutory Paternity Pay for eligible employees is either £135.45 a week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower). </p>

<p>Paternity pay can only be paid while the employee is on paternity leave. Tax and National Insurance need to be deducted.</p>
