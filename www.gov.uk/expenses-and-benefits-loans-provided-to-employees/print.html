  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing loans to your employees or their relatives, you have certain National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>There are different rules depending on whether you provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘beneficial loans’, which are interest-free, or at a rate below <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/interest-beneficial.htm" title="HMRC's official interest rate"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s official interest rate</a>
</li>
  <li>loans you write off</li>
</ul>
<h3>Beneficial loans</h3>

<p>The rules cover beneficial loans advanced, arranged, facilitated, guaranteed or taken over from someone else by:</p>

<ul>
<li>you (the employer)</li>
  <li>a company or partnership you control</li>
  <li>a company or partnership that controls your business</li>
  <li>a person with a material interest in your business</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees/technical-guidance" title="technical guidance">technical guidance</a> for what to do in more complicated situations, eg if you use third-party arrangements to make a loan to your employee.</p>


</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You might not have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax and National Insurance on <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees/overview" title="beneficial loans">beneficial loans</a>.</p>

<p>A beneficial loan is exempt if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide it in the normal course of a domestic or family relationship as an individual (not as a company you control, even if you are the sole owner and employee)</li>
  <li>provide loans with a combined outstanding value to an employee of less than £5,000 throughout the whole tax year</li>
  <li>provide it to an employee for a fixed and invariable period, and at a fixed and invariable rate that was equal to or higher than <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/interest-beneficial.htm" title="HMRC's official interest rate"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s official interest rate</a> when the loan was taken out</li>
  <li>provide it under identical terms and conditions to the general public as well (this mostly applies to commercial lenders)</li>
  <li>provide ‘qualifying loans’ for which all of the interest qualifies for tax relief – see the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees/technical-guidance" title="technical guidance">technical guidance</a> for an explanation of this complex area</li>
  <li>provide it to employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 per year (if they aren’t directors)</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the loans you provide <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees" title="aren't exempt">aren’t exempt</a>, you have to report the costs to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and deduct or pay National Insurance on them.</p>

<h2>Beneficial loans</h2>

<p>If you or your business provides a beneficial loan, as defined in the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees/overview" title="overview">overview</a>, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section H</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees/work-out-the-value" title="value of the benefit">value of the benefit</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Loans you write off</h2>

<p>You always have to report and pay on loans to employees that you write off, whether or not they are classed as beneficial loans.</p>
