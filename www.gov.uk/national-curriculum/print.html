  </header><p>The national curriculum is a set of subjects and standards used by <a href="/types-of-school" title="Types of school">primary and secondary schools</a> so children learn the same things. It covers what subjects are taught and the standards children should reach in each subject.</p>

<p>Other <a href="/types-of-school" title="Types of school">types of school</a> like <a href="/types-of-school/academies" title="Academies">academies</a> and <a href="/types-of-school/private-schools" title="Private schools">private schools</a> don’t have to follow the national curriculum. Academies must teach a broad and balanced curriculum including English, maths and science. They must also teach religious education.</p>

<h2>Key stages</h2>

<p>The national curriculum is organised into blocks of years called ‘key stages’ (KS). At the end of each key stage, your child’s teacher will formally assess their performance to measure your child’s progress.</p>

<h3>Levels of attainment</h3>

<p>For each subject there’s a ‘programme of study’. It describes what children should learn. There are also ‘attainment targets’ - usually split into 8 levels for each subject. You’ll get a school report at the end of the year telling you what level your child is at. <a rel="external" href="http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/index.aspx" title="National Curriculum online">Read more about what children will learn.</a></p>

</article><article id="early-years-foundation-scheme"><header><h1>Part 2: Early Years Foundation Scheme</h1>
  </header><p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DCSF-00261-2008" title="Early Years Foundation Scheme">Early Years Foundation Scheme</a> sets standards for the learning, development and care of children from birth to 5. </p>

<p>All childminders, preschools and nurseries must follow the scheme. It has levels of development most children can be expected to reach by age 5. There may be tests but these will will only be used to help teachers know how each child is doing.</p>

<p>There are 6 areas that Early Years concentrates on:</p>

<ul>
<li>personal, social and emotional development</li>
  <li>communication, language and literacy</li>
  <li>problem solving, reasoning and numeracy</li>
  <li>knowledge and understanding of the world</li>
  <li>physical development</li>
  <li>creative development</li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching is often done through play, where the child learns about subjects and other people through games.</p>

<h2>Early Years profile</h2>

<p>Towards the end of Early Years, the teacher records each child’s development by watching the child playing and in the classroom. The completed assessment is known as the ‘Early Years profile’. This is used to help the Year 1 teacher plan lessons for the children.</p>

<h2>Tests and assessments</h2>

<h3>Year 1 phonics screening check</h3>

<p>Your child will read 40 words out loud to a teacher who’ll then assess whether your child needs extra help with the mechanics of reading.</p>

<h3>Key Stage 1</h3>

<p>Key Stage 1 tests cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>reading</li>
  <li>writing</li>
  <li>maths</li>
  <li>science</li>
</ul>
<p>The tests are taken when the school chooses. You’ll get the results but they’re only used to help the teacher assess your child’s work.</p>

<h3>Key Stage 2</h3>

<p>Key Stage 2 tests cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>English: reading and spelling</li>
  <li>maths (including mental arithmetic)</li>
  <li>science (only schools selected to participate in a national sample)</li>
</ul>
<p>The tests are taken on set days in mid-May and last under 5.5 hours. You will get the results of these tests.</p>

<h3>Key Stage 4</h3>

<p>During Key Stage 4 most pupils work towards national qualifications - usually GCSEs.</p>

<p>Subjects children have to study:</p>

<ul>
<li>English</li>
  <li>maths</li>
  <li>science</li>
  <li>information and communication technology (<abbr title="Information and communication technology">ICT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>physical education</li>
  <li>citizenship</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools must also offer at least 1 subject from each of these areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>arts</li>
  <li>design and technology</li>
  <li>humanities</li>
  <li>modern foreign languages</li>
</ul></article><article id="other-compulsory-subjects"><header><h1>Part 5: Other compulsory subjects</h1>

<ul>
<li>careers education (year 9 onwards)</li>
  <li>citizenship</li>
  <li>information and communication technology (ICT)</li>
  <li>physical education</li>
  <li>sex and relationships education (year 7 onwards)</li>
  <li>religious education</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sex and relationship education</h2>

<p>Compulsory from age 11 onwards, sex and relationship education (<abbr title="Sex and relationship education">SRE</abbr>) involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. The importance of stable relationships (eg marriage) and family life are emphasised. <abbr title="Sex and relationship education">SRE</abbr> doesn’t promote early sexual activity and it doesn’t promote any particular sexual orientation.</p>

<p>Some elements of sex and relationship education are mandatory - these are part of the national curriculum for science. Parents can withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.</p>

<h2>Religious education</h2>

<p>Schools also have to teach religious education but parents can withdraw their children for all or part of the lessons. Local councils are responsible for deciding on a syllabus.</p>
