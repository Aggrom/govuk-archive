  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="what-corrections-can-be-made"><header><h1>Part 1: What corrections can be made</h1>
  </header><p>Corrections can only be made when the information in a marriage register is wrong (eg a mistake was made when recording a person’s occupation). </p>

<p>You can’t apply for a correction to show new information if circumstances change after the marriage.</p>

<p>You’ll need to find out if the mistake was made when entering information in the marriage register or just on the marriage certificate. To do this contact:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="/register-offices" title="Find your register office">register office</a> where your civil marriage took place</li>
  <li>the officer who was responsible for registering your religious marriage or the person who is responsible now</li>
</ul>
<h2>If the mistake is only on the marriage certificate</h2>

<p>If the details in the register are correct, and the mistake was made when copying the details from the register onto the certificate, you can <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate" title="Order a copy of a birth, death or marriage certificate">order a new copy</a> of the certificate.</p>

<h2>If the mistake is in the original registration</h2>

<p>You’ll need to <a href="/correct-marriage-registration/how-to-apply" title="How to apply">apply</a> to the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) to make this correction.</p>

<p>The original information will always be shown in the marriage register. After the correction has been authorised, a note will be added to the margin of the register. This will explain what the correct information is and when the correction was made. </p>

<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>If you want further advice on applying to make a correction, contact the <a href="/register-offices" title="Find your register office">register office</a> or the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>.</p>

  </header><p>If the mistake is in the register, you’ll need to complete an application form and send it to the General Register Office (GRO). </p>

</div>

<p>Any correction to a marriage entry needs to be authorised by GRO before it goes ahead at a register office or at any religious building.</p>

<h2>Proving the record is wrong</h2>

<p>You’ll need to provide original or <a href="/certifying-a-document" title="Certifying a document">certified</a> documents to show what the correct information should have been at the time of the marriage. Send them to the register office team or to the person dealing with your correction at the religious building. They will then forward copies to GRO. This prevents your original documents from getting lost in the post. </p>

<p>The documents should have been valid at the time of the marriage or just before. You can’t use documents from after the date of the marriage to make a correction to a marriage entry.</p>

<p>Documents you can send in include a:</p>

<ul>
<li>passport</li>
  <li>photocard driving licence</li>
  <li>bank, building society or credit card statement dated within 3 months before the marriage</li>
  <li>letter from a hospital or doctor</li>
  <li>letter from a government department</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you can’t send in proof, corrections can’t usually be made.</p>
</div>

<h2>Witnessing the correction</h2>
<p>There must always be 2 witnesses to a correction to a marriage record - they can be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the people who got married </li>
  <li>nominated by the people who got married </li>
</ul>
<p>Witnesses don’t have to have been at the original marriage. However, they do need to know about the information that’s going to be corrected.</p>

<h2>How much it costs</h2>

<p>It’s free to make a correction to the register. </p>

<p>It costs £9.25 to <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate" title="Order a copy of a birth, death or marriage certificate">get a new certificate</a> that shows the correction note. </p>

</article><article id="how-long-applications-take"><header><h1>Part 4: How long applications take</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re making an application to the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) and there are no problems with your application, you should receive a reply within 5 working days.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr> asks you for more information, each further reply from them may take up to 20 working days.</p>

<p>Applications may take longer to process in exceptional circumstances. </p>


</article><article id="when-the-correction-has-been-approved"><header><h1>Part 5: When the correction has been approved</h1>
  </header><p>When the General Register Office (<abbr title="General Register Office">GRO</abbr>) has approved the correction, it will send authorisation and details of the correction to the register office or religious building. You’ll then need to arrange for whoever is going to witness the correction to attend the register office or religious building to witness the correction being carried out.</p>

<p>After the correction has been carried out you can <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate" title="Order a copy of a birth, death or marriage certificate">buy a new marriage certificate</a> that shows the original information along with a note of the corrected details. </p>
