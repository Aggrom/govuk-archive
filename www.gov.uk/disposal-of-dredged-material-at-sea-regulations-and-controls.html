<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Organisations like harbour authorities, port and marina operators and developers need to dredge, periodically, in order to deepen harbour and navigation channels or prepare the seabed before laying cables or pipelines. The disposal of this dredged material at sea is, however, strictly controlled under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (<abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr>) licensing system because it is potentially very damaging to marine life and the marine environment.</p>

<p>The type of licence required and the cost depends on whether the operation is classified as ‘capital’ or ‘maintenance’ dredging. <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licences usually only last for one year, but in some cases longer term licences are available for ongoing dredging operations.</p>

<h2 id="disposing-of-materials-at-sea">Disposing of materials at sea</h2>

<p>Disposing of materials at sea can pose a serious threat to marine life and the marine environment so it is strictly controlled and requires a licence granted under <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr>. In most cases, disposing of materials at sea also requires consent under the Coast Protection Act 1949 (<abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Most forms of disposal at sea are now prohibited, with the exception of material dredged from harbours and ports. But even this is strictly controlled and is only allowed where the dredged material can’t be used beneficially, for example to replenish beaches.</p>

<p>If the dredged material cannot be used beneficially then it is disposed of at licensed disposal sites. There are over 200 sites in the waters around the UK, of which about 100 are in use at any one time. To find out where these are in England and Wales you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/licensing/marine/activities/disposal.htm">find disposal of dredged materials information on the Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<p>As well as dredged material there are other types of waste that may be considered for disposal at sea, including fish waste from processing plants.</p>

<h3 id="fepa-licence-exemptions">
<abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licence exemptions</h3>

<p>There is, however, a range of material-depositing activities that are exempt from the <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licensing requirements. These include the deposit of:</p>

<ul>
<li>scientific instruments</li>
  <li>fishing gear</li>
  <li>material on the site of drilling for oil and gas</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/licensing/marine/activities.htm">read a detailed list of exemptions from <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licensing on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-future-of-marine-licensing">The future of marine licensing</h3>

<p>From spring 2011, the marine licensing system will be simplified and the existing <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> and <abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr> systems will be replaced by a single licensing system. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/licensing/how/decision_making.htm">find out about the new marine licensing system on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="waste-management-licences">Waste management licences</h3>

<p>As long as you have the correct <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licence - or the materials you deposit are exempt from <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licensing - you will not need to get a waste management licence from the Environment Agency.</p>

<h2 id="disposing-of-dredged-materials">Disposing of dredged materials</h2>

<p>Dredging may be carried out periodically by harbour authorities, port and marina operators, dredging companies, developers and the marine aggregate industry for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating navigational channels</li>
  <li>maintaining a safe depth of water for navigational purposes</li>
  <li>restoring an adequate flow of water to lessen the risk of flooding</li>
  <li>removing areas of seabed during construction works</li>
  <li>preparing the seabed before laying cables and pipelines</li>
  <li>extracting marine aggregates like sand and gravel</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> issues licences for the disposal of dredged material at sea under <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr>. The charge for a <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> disposal licence varies depending on the type and quantity of the material dredged. This is known as the licence band. Different charges also apply depending on whether the material is classified as ‘capital’ or ‘maintenance’ dredgings - see the next page in this guide on <strong>capital or maintenance dredging</strong>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://marinemanagement.org.uk/licensing/marine/activities/dredging.htm">check the cost of a <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> disposal licence on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="how-the-mmo-treats-licence-applications">How the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> treats licence applications</h3>

<p>By defining each dredged material, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> then knows how to treat an application for a licence, although it is not always straightforward. There may be cases, for example, where a capital dredging operation includes a small amount of maintenance dredging and the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> decides that both materials can be disposed of at the same site. They may regard all the material as capital and include it on a single licence but if they can’t be disposed of together, separate licences will be required.</p>

<p>If the dredged material is destined for a beneficial purpose, like enhancing or conserving habitats, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will issue a ‘beneficial use’ licence. These typically cost significantly less than disposal licences.</p>

<h2 id="capital-or-maintenance-dredging">Capital or maintenance dredging</h2>

<p>Dredging operations are classed as either ‘capital’ or ‘maintenance’ for licensing purposes.</p>

<h3 id="capital-dredgings">Capital dredgings</h3>

<p>Capital dredgings refer to materials excavated from a seabed area which has not been dredged for ten years.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance-dredgings">Maintenance dredgings</h3>

<p>Maintenance dredgings come from:</p>

<ul>
<li>areas where the seabed level is no lower after dredging than it has been for the past ten years</li>
  <li>areas where there is evidence that dredging has taken place during the last ten years to the proposed level or lower</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="costs">Costs</h3>

<p>Licence costs for capital dredgings disposal are generally more expensive than maintenance dredgings because:</p>

<ul>
<li>capital dredging is often associated with other works, which means the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> needs to consult with other regulators before issuing a licence</li>
  <li>capital dredging may generate material that hasn’t been categorised before, which is likely to need more thorough monitoring to validate dispersal predictions and environmental impact</li>
  <li>the quantity of capital material dredged or the characteristics of the sediment may mean that a new disposal site has to be designated</li>
  <li>there is often a need to examine whether the capital material can be used beneficially or to lessen the effects of the dredging</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://marinemanagement.org.uk/licensing/marine/activities/dredging.htm">read a detailed comparison of the costs of capital and maintenance dredging licences on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="contaminated-dredged-marine-sediments">Contaminated dredged marine sediments</h2>

<p>Historic and ongoing contamination of bottom sediments has been caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>mining and other industries in river catchments</li>
  <li>industrial shipping and other activities at the coast, in estuaries and particularly within ports</li>
</ul>
<p>Contaminated sediments can pose environmental and social risks. But it is increasingly necessary to dredge these sediments to create new and improved port facilities that can accommodate large vessels and the expansion of associated maritime trade.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-contaminated-dredged-marine-sediment">Disposing of contaminated dredged marine sediment</h3>

<p>Before applying for a licence to dispose of contaminated marine sediments, you should consider whether there are alternative or beneficial uses for the sediments. If there are, and they will take place in the marine environment, they require a <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> ‘beneficial use’ licence.</p>

<p>If it is not possible for the sediments to be used in this way, the port authority carrying out the proposed dredging must apply for a <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> disposal licence to dump the material at sea at a designated disposal site.</p>

<p>Before the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will issue a licence, the impact of displacing and disposing the sediments must be thoroughly assessed. This assessment will include identifying whether an area is affected by the presence of contaminants, such as metals or tributyltin.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/marine/legislation/sediment/index.htm">find out about the management of contaminated marine sediments on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h2 id="licences-for-longer-term-dredging">Licences for longer-term dredging</h2>

<p>Most dredging campaigns are only carried out periodically and licence extensions are only granted in certain circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="ongoing-dredging">Ongoing dredging</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will consider licensing on-going dredging operations on a longer-term basis. On-going operations include large-scale capital projects, or instances where a broadly similar amount of dredged maintenance material from the same licensed area is removed on an annual basis.</p>

<h3 id="conditions-of-longer-term-licensing">Conditions of longer-term licensing</h3>

<p>Before issuing longer-term licences, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> needs to be satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the material being disposed of is consistently uncontaminated</li>
  <li>there would be no viable alternative method of disposal, which would prevent the material from needing to be disposed of at sea, during the period of the licence</li>
  <li>ongoing monitoring and inspection of the operation does not raise new concerns about its potential impact on the marine environment and other uses of the sea</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="duration-of-longer-term-licences">Duration of longer-term licences</h3>

<p>Longer-term licences are available to cover three years in one-year periods. But consideration must be given every year during the period of the licence to alternative methods of disposing of the material, with a view to reducing the overall quantity of material licensed.</p>

<p>There are also further conditions depending on whether the operation is classed as capital or maintenance dredging.</p>

<p>For a longer-term licence to be issued for disposing of capital dredgings, the operation must be scheduled to continue for more than 12 months.</p>

<p>For a longer-term licence to be issued for disposing of maintenance dredgings:</p>

<ul>
<li>the current and previous two licences must have been issued for the same dredged area, with any variations in the licensed quantity of material for disposal not exceeding plus or minus 25%</li>
  <li>the results of sample analysis - including samples obtained for the previous three licence applications - must show that the levels of contaminants are acceptable, and that the nature of the dredged material and the sensitivity of the disposal area do not give cause for special consideration</li>
  <li>there has to have been full compliance with the terms and conditions of the current licence</li>
</ul>
<p>When the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> issues a licence, they advise the licensee on whether they meet the conditions for a longer-term licence. If not, they issue a standard licence, except where an application has been refused.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/licensing/marine/fees.htm">check the cost of longer-term licences on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="cpa-consents-and-fepa-licences">
<abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr> consents and <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licences</h2>

<p>The current system of <abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr> consents and <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licensing is used to protect the offshore environment.</p>

<h3 id="cpa-consents">
<abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr> consents</h3>

<p><abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr> consent is required for:</p>

<ul>

<p><abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr> consent normally lasts for three years. But if you need a <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licence as well as <abbr title="Coast Protection Act 1949">CPA</abbr> consent, you can choose to have the duration of the consent changed so that they both expire at the same time.

<h3 id="fepa-licences">
<abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licences</h3>

<p><abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licences are mainly used to permit construction within the marine environment and to control deposits of articles into the sea or tidal waters. You can <a rel="external" href="http://marinemanagement.org.uk/licensing/index.htm">get details of the activities a <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licence is needed for on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> licences for dredging usually last for one year, but longer-term licences may also be issued - see the page in this guide on <strong>licences for longer-term dredging</strong>.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Food and Environment Protection Act 1985">FEPA</abbr> ‘beneficial use’ licence will be issued if dredged material can be put to beneficial use in the marine environment instead of being dumped.
