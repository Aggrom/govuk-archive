<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Open General Export Licences (<abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr>) are pre-published export licences issued by the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>). They are the most flexible type of strategic export licence, as long as all pre-set conditions can be met. They allow the export of specified controlled items (identified by a ‘control list entry’ heading) to specific destinations. </p>

<p>For more background, read the overview guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/open-general-licences-an-overview">Open General Licences</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> issues a wide range of <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr>, including for military goods.  </p>

<p>If you can meet all <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> licensing conditions, you do not need to apply for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/licences-export-trade-control-and-transhipment">Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL)</a>. If however you cannot and the goods are still controlled then you will need to apply for a SIEL. </p>

<p>All <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> holders are subject to regular <a href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology">compliance audits</a> conducted by <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="your-responsibilities-in-using-an-ogel">Your responsibilities in using an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Before using any <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> for your export purposes, you should first check that you can meet all its defined terms and conditions. To do so, you can use the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk"><abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> Checker database</a>. You should also know the control list classification or ‘rating’ of your product. If you are unsure what this is, you should consult the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">UK Strategic Export Control Lists</a>. For more information, see guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dual-use-open-general-export-licences-explained">strategic exports: when to request an export licence</a>.</p>

<p>It is also your responsibility as the exporter to:</p>

<ul>
<li>register to use <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> on <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s export licensing database, <a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk">SPIRE</a>
</li>
  <li>use <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> within all pre-defined terms and conditions</li>
  <li>keep up-to-date with any <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> amendments - eg changes to permitted or excluded destinations or goods</li>
  <li>be prepared for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology">compliance audits</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>This <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> allows, subject to certain conditions, the export or transfer of military goods or technology under the US-UK Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty from the UK to the US. </p>

<p>This permission is with the limitation that the licence is only used by members of the ‘Approved Community’ and provided that the ultimate end-user of the goods or technology is the US or UK Government.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-approved-community-and-how-do-i-get-onto-the-list">What is the ‘Approved Community’ and how do I get onto the list?</h3>

<p>Organisations that comprise the UK ‘Approved Community’ are defined by Article 4(1) of the treaty. <a rel="external" href="http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/treaties/index.html">Download a copy of the US-UK Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty on the US Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls website.</a></p>

<p>To qualify for membership of the ‘Approved Community’, private companies must satisfy the UK and US due diligence approval process and meet specific security requirements. This includes adhering to the relevant provisions of the UK Government’s <abbr title="Security Policy Framework">SPF</abbr>. The process for applying for ‘Approved Community’ status is described on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence (MOD)">MOD</abbr> website in Industrial Secruity Notice 2012-01. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/CorporatePublications/SecurityandIntelligencePublications/PSyA/IndustrySecurityNoticesisns.htm">Download Industrial Security Notices published on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence (MOD)">MOD</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>This guidance is issued in the context of the <abbr title="Security Policy Framework">SPF</abbr> published by the Cabinet Office. The Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty provisions in the <abbr title="Security Policy Framework">SPF</abbr> can only be accessed by non-Governmental entities in the DTCT (US-UK Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty) ‘Approved Community’ via the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence (MOD)">MOD</abbr> Defence Equipment &amp; Support Infrastructure Security website after formal registration, which is a mandated condition of ‘Approved Community’ membership.

This document concerns the procedures in four different scenarios when a UK ‘Approved Community’ facility wishes to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>re-transfer items to a ‘Non-Approved Community’  entity in the UK</li>
  <li>re-export items to a ‘Non-Approved Community’ entity overseas for return to a UK ‘Approved Community’ entity</li>
  <li>re-export to a ‘Non-Approved Community’ entity overseas for its end-use</li>
  <li>re-export by an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence (MOD)">MOD</abbr> entity to a ‘Non-Approved Community’ entity overseas for its end-use</li>

<p>The guidance document above also outlines what steps ‘Approved Community’ companies need to take to obtain approval from the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence (MOD)">MOD</abbr> using the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence (MOD)">MOD</abbr> Form 680 procedure.
