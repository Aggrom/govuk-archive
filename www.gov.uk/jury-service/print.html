  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>By law, you must do jury service when asked. It will be as local as possible to where you live.</p>

<p>When you’re sent a ‘jury summons’, you must complete and return it within 7 days.</p>

<p>Once your jury service is confirmed, you must turn up on the agreed start date. If you don’t, you could be fined £1,000.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Jury service is unpaid but you can claim for food and drink, travel and loss of earnings.</p>
</div>

<h2>When you can’t do jury service</h2>

<p>There are some situations when you can’t be on a jury - eg if you’ve been in prison in the last 10 years. These are listed in the summons.</p>

<h2>How long jury service lasts</h2>

<p>Jury service usually lasts for up to 10 working days - but can be longer.</p>

<p>Many trials last only 2 or 3 days, so you may be on a jury for another trial.</p>

</article><article id="taking-time-off-work"><header><h1>Part 2: Taking time off work</h1>
  </header><p>Give a copy of the letter confirming your jury service to your employer. </p>

<p>Your employer must let you have time off work - however, they can ask you to delay your jury service if your absence will have a serious effect on business.</p>

<h2>Wages during jury service</h2>
<p>Your employer doesn’t have to pay you but you can <a href="what-you-can-claim" title="What you can claim for during jury service">claim for loss of earnings</a> from the court.</p>

<p>Your employer must fill out a Certificate of Loss of Earnings which you get with the letter confirming your jury service. You then send it as part of your claim for expenses once you’ve completed jury service.</p>

<h2>Problems with your employer</h2>

<p>You can complain to an <a href="/employment-tribunals" title="Employment tribunals">employment tribunal</a> if you’re unreasonably refused time off for jury service.</p>

<p>If you’re sacked because you do jury service you may be able to claim unfair dismissal. However, if your employer asks you to delay jury service and you refuse, you may not be able to claim unfair dismissal.</p>

</article><article id="delaying-or-being-excused-from-jury-service"><header><h1>Part 3: Delaying or being excused from jury service</h1>
  </header><p>You may be able to delay (‘defer’) your jury service - eg if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a holiday booked</li>
  <li>are having an operation</li>
</ul>
<p>You must state on the summons when you’re available for jury service in the following 12 months.</p>

<p>You can only defer jury service once in that 12-month period.</p>

<p>If you can’t do jury service at any time during the 12 months you must state the reason. You normally have to give evidence - like a letter from your doctor about a medical condition you have.</p>

</article><article id="discussing-the-trial"><header><h1>Part 4: Discussing the trial</h1>
  </header><p>Don’t discuss the case with anyone, except other jury members in the jury deliberation room.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Even when the trial’s over you mustn’t discuss the case, even with family members.</p>
</div>

<p>Don’t post comments about the trial on social media websites like Facebook or Twitter - even after the trial’s finished. This is contempt of court and you can be fined or sent to prison.</p>

<h2>If anyone approaches you about the trial</h2>

<p>If you’re approached tell a court official - or a police officer if it happens outside court.</p>

<h2>If you find the trial distressing</h2>

<p>You may be upset by the trial and want to speak to someone privately. Speak to court staff who can give you advice.</p>

<p>You could also contact the charity <a rel="external" href="http://www.samaritans.org/" title="Samaritans">Samaritans.</a></p>


</article><article id="what-you-can-claim"><header><h1>Part 5: What you can claim</h1>
  </header><p>You can normally claim for:</p>

<ul>
<li>travel</li>
  <li>lunch and refreshments</li>
  <li>loss of earnings and other expenses - eg employing a child-minder or carer (outside your usual care arrangements)</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial support and benefits (like Jobseeker’s Allowance) are unaffected for the first 8 weeks while on jury service.</p>

<p>There’s a maximum daily amount you can claim each day for loss of earnings and other expenses.</p>

  </header><p>Make your claim for expenses at the end of your jury service - and no more than 3 months later. </p>

<p>If the trial’s likely to last a long time (eg several months) the court can make special arrangements for payment. </p>

<p>Fill in the claim form included in your jury pack (which you’re given at the start of jury service) and return it to the court with all relevant receipts.</p>

<p>You should also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Certificate of Loss of Earnings if you’re working or on benefits (completed by your employer or benefits office)</li>
  <li>evidence of loss of earnings if you’re self-employed - eg the previous year’s tax return</li>
</ul>
<p>You will usually be paid 7 to 10 working days after submitting your claim form.</p>
