</div>

<p>You may have been able to get <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> before 31 January 2011 if you couldn’t work because of illness or disability.</p>

</h2>

<p><abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> is being phased out. This means <a href="/severe-disablement-allowance/further-information" title="further information">Jobcentre Plus will review your <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> claim</a>.

<p>Since 31 January 2011 it hasn’t been possible for people with existing entitlement to <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> to make a further claim, eg after working.

  </header><h2>Review of your Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> is being phased out. Jobcentre Plus will review your <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> claim to check if you’re capable of work or can get <a href="/employment-support-allowance" title="Employment and Support Allowance">Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</a> instead.</p>

<p>Your benefit claim will not be reviewed if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re already getting <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you are due to reach State Pension age before 6 April 2014</li>
</ul>
<h2>How your claim will be reviewed</h2>

<p>Jobcentre Plus will write to you when your benefit claim is going to be reviewed. Not everyone will be contacted at the same time. This process started in October 2010 and is expected to be completed in 2014.</p>

<h3>Questionnaire</h3>

<p>Jobcentre Plus will send you a questionnaire to complete. This questionnaire will ask about how your long term health condition or disability affects your ability to complete everyday tasks.</p>

<p>You must complete this questionnaire with as much detail as possible and return it by the date requested. If you do not, your benefit claim may be affected.</p>

<h3>Work Capability Assessment</h3>

<p>The information you give will be used to decide if you need to attend a face-to-face assessment. This is called Work Capability Assessment. This assessment will help find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>what you’re able to do</li>
  <li>whether you might be capable of work</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re asked to attend an assessment, you must go and take part fully. If you don’t, your benefit claim may be affected.</p>

<h2>If the review finds that you’re capable of working</h2>

<p>If the assessment finds that you’re capable of working, Jobcentre Plus will call you. They will discuss what benefits you might be able to claim, eg Jobseeker’s Allowance. They will also write to you.</p>

<h2>If the review finds you’re entitled to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you’re entitled to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, Jobcentre Plus will call you to let you know. They will also write to you.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> claim will be transferred automatically to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>. There will be no break in the payments you get.</p>

<p>Depending on how severe your disability or health condition is, you will be placed in one of two groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work Related Activity Group</li>
  <li>Support Group</li>
</ul>
<h3>Work Related Activity Group</h3>

<p>If you’re placed in the Work Related Activity Group, you will get support to help you prepare for suitable work.</p>

<p>Your benefit may be affected if you don’t take part in the work-related support.</p>

<h3>Support Group</h3>

<p>If you are severely disabled or have the most severe health conditions you will be placed in the Support Group. You will not be expected to look for work and will get the extra support you need.</p>

<p>You will not have to take up any work-related support unless you want to.</p>

<h2>If your circumstances change</h2>

<p>Tell <a rel="external" href="http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=2&amp;lang=en" title="contact Jobcentre Plus">Jobcentre Plus</a> if your circumstances change. Some examples of the changes you need to report include:</p>

<ul>
<li>doing any work, including voluntary work</li>
  <li>starting training and getting a training allowance</li>
  <li>changing your address</li>
  <li>going abroad</li>
