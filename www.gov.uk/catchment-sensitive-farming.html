<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Pollution from farming is a major contributor to water pollution. The aim of the Catchment Sensitive Farming (<abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr>) Programme in England is to reduce pollution from farming in surface waters, groundwaters and other aquatic habitats, both in the immediate catchment and further downstream.</p>

<p>The information on these pages will explain the problems that diffuse water pollution can cause, and how you can reduce it by managing the use of soils, fertilisers, manures and pesticides.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> Programme is delivered primarily via the <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> Project (formerly known as the England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative (<abbr title="England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative">ECSFDI</abbr>). <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> supports farms through targeted, small capital grants (through the Capital Grants Scheme) and free training, information and advice focussing primarily in priority catchments identified within River Basin Districts across England and working with local and national partners in catchments and national partnerships.</p>

<p>This guide will also explain how <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> and Nitrate Vulnerable Zones interrelate. The guide also includes an interactive advice and guidance tool on <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="water-pollution-from-farming-and-how-to-reduce-it">Water pollution from farming, and how to reduce it</h2>

<p>Diffuse water pollution is caused by pollutants being washed into water courses, water bodies or groundwater over a large area from many sources.</p>

<p>Agriculture is the single largest source of diffuse water pollution, particularly through:</p>

<ul>
<li>nutrients and faecal contaminants from fertilisers and manure/ livestock management</li>
  <li>sediment from soil erosion and bank disturbance</li>
  <li>pesticides (plant protection products - <abbr title="plant protection products">PPPs</abbr> and veterinarian products eg sheep dips) from handling and applying the chemicals</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the harmful elements entering our waters, agriculture accounts for approximately:</p>

<ul>
<li>about two thirds of nitrogen that leads to over-enrichment and acidification of sensitive soils, habitats and fresh water</li>
  <li>between 10% and 60% of the phosphate leves in water</li>
  <li>76% of the sediments in rivers</li>
</ul>
<p>These numbers will vary considerably between different catchment throughout the country</p>

<h3 id="harmful-effects-of-water-pollution-from-farming">Harmful effects of water pollution from farming</h3>

<p>Water pollution from farming can affect rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwaters, and add to the loss of species diversity. Nitrates, pesticides and faecal indicator organisms can prevent water from being used for drinking, recreation and shellfishery harvesting.</p>

<p>Nitrate pollution in both ground and surface waters is of particular concern because excess nitrate must be removed to make water safe for human consumption. High levels of nitrates (and also phosphates) can harm water quality. High phosphorous and nitrogen levels can cause eutrophication, which is the enrichment of water by nutrients, causing algae to grow quicker thereby disturbing the balance of organisms present in the water. This can ultimately lead to sections of waterbody being killed off through oxygen removal.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-water-pollution-from-farming">Reducing water pollution from farming</h3>

<p>The Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (<abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>) regulations aim to reduce the impact of nitrates impacting on designated waters.  These regulations only apply to those farms located within or partially within the designated zones - around 70% of England. Farms outside of <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> need not comply with these specific requirements, so have a much reduced regulatory burden in dealing with nitrates. However, it is in your best interests to tackle it through voluntary schemes such as the <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> project. See the guide on NVZs.</p>

<p>To help reduce the risk of polluting water you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <abbr title="plant protection products">PPPs</abbr> carefully and ensure they primarily make contact with target species. You need to minimise risks to water by carefully planning application, considering weather, drainflow, soil conditions and field situation to reduce the risk of pesticides reaching water. You need to organise filling, washdown and handling to prevent pesticides reaching water. You can read how to minimise the environmental impacts from pesticides on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.voluntaryinitiative.org.uk">Voluntary Initiative website</a>. You can also download the Voluntary Initiative’s advice on best practice for catchments with key pesticides from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264243&amp;id=264244">Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 498KB)</a>
</li>
  <li>manage soil correctly. Well-managed soils reduce the risk of soil erosion and pesticide/phosphate loss from surface run-off or in sediment. See the guide on soil use. You can find a practical guide to soil assessment on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/soils.aspx">Think Soils website</a>
</li>
  <li>ensure that dirty water from a treated area cannot run off and directly enter a watercourse, ie reduc the connectivity between high risk activities and source rivers and lakes. Much can be done to prevent this through track, machinery and buffer management</li>
  <li>follow the Code of Good Agricultural Practice and cross compliance requirements.</li>
  <li>dispose of sheep dip compounds properly. Sheep dip is usually highly toxic to aquatic life and can cause serious environmental damage. The Groundwater Regulations 1998 apply to sheep dipping and disposal of used dip. For advice on what you should do before, during and after dipping to protect groundwater, download the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) groundwater protection code on the use and disposal of sheep dip compounds from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=2219&amp;id=15589"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 207KB)</a> or download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s checklist of the key points of the code to groundwater protection from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=2219&amp;id=65845"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 21KB)</a>
</li>
  <li>manage nutrient and manure applications to focus these valuable resources on growing crops rather than running off into adjacent waterways. You can read <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s fertiliser recommendations handbook on the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?id=2RRVTHNXTS.88UEOT33RAD2A"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>.</li>
  <li>seek further support for making the most of livestock manures and other fertilisers for crop growth on the PLANET website. You can find a Nutrient management Plan on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nutrientmanagement.org">Tried &amp; Tested website</a>
</li>
  <li>search for best farming practice guidance on the <a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/epages/eapublications.storefront/4a85189f006e01e0273fc0a80296066a/Product/View/GEHO0908BOMP&amp;2DE&amp;2DE#">Environment Agency website</a>
</li>
  <li>read the step by fertiliser/manure planning system called ‘Tried and Tested’. To request a copy you can find contact details for Tried and Tested on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nutrientmanagement.org/contact-us/">Tried and Tested website</a>, or download a copy of the Tried and Tested fertiliser/manure planning system from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=253484&amp;id=253485"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 1.57MB)</a>.</li>
  <li>seek advice and support through funding.</li>

<h2 id="catchment-sensitive-farming-project">Catchment Sensitive Farming Project</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> Project is a voluntary initiative delivered jointly between <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, the Environment Agency and Natural England.</p>

<p><abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> means managing land in a way that keeps emissions of agricultural pollutants such as nutrients, sediment and pesticides, to levels that will not harm the ecology and other uses of surface waters, groundwaters and other aquatic habitats.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-key-aspects-of-csf">What are the key aspects of <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr>?</h3>

<p>Through free training, information and advice (one-to-one farm visits and group events) and the Capital Grant Scheme the <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> Project aims to ensure the following practices are adopted:</p>

<ul>
<li>managing the use of fertilisers, manures and pesticides efficiently and using best practice</li>
  <li>best practice machinery and livestock management, appropriate cropping and cultivation to improve soil structure and rain infiltration, helping to avoid run-off and erosion</li>
  <li>protecting watercourses from faecal contamination, sedimentation and pesticides</li>
  <li>reducing stocking density on land highly connected to water courses or at high risk of soil compaction and erosion/run-off</li>
  <li>managing stock on farms to avoid compaction and poaching of land and bankside erosion</li>
  <li>separating clean and dirty water on farms in order to improve the efficiency of manure storage and to reduce the risk of dirty/contaminated water entering watercourses</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about what is available under <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/farming/csf/default.aspx">Natural England <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> website</a> and also find <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s information about <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> behaviours and practices on the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=95393&amp;id=264236"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="catchment-sensitive-farming-and-capital-grants-scheme">Catchment Sensitive Farming and Capital Grants Scheme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> project is a partnership between <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, Natural England and the Environment Agency.</p>

<p><abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> seeks to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture by encouraging farmers to adopt best practice voluntarily.</p>

<p><abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> is operating in priority catchments covering over 46% of the total utilisable agricultural area in England, either with support from Catchment Sensitive Farming Officers (<abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming Officers">CSFOs</abbr>) or with support delivered in partnership with local organisations, called strategic partnerships.</p>

<p>Its assistance takes two forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Capital Grants Scheme</li>
  <li>training, information and advice</li>
</ul>
<p>The Capital Grants Scheme will be available in 2012-13 and is targeted to areas within the priority catchments. £10.5 million is available for the scheme in 2012-13.</p>

<p>The scheme aims to help farmers and land mangers within those catchments to tackle diffuse water pollution from agriculture. Grants of up to £10,000 for infrastructure investments such as roofing over manure or slurry stores continue to be awarded on a competitive basis to eligible farmers. Securing an agreement is therefore not guaranteed and acceptance depends on the quality of all applications.</p>

<h2 id="catchment-sensitive-farming-cross-compliance-and-statutory-management-requirements">Catchment Sensitive Farming, cross compliance and Statutory Management Requirements</h2>

<p>Even if you are not receiving a single farm payment, you need to comply with the Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>) under cross compliance that relate to <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="smr-2---groundwater">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 2 - groundwater</h3>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 2 aims to protect groundwater by controlling how you discharge or dispose of potentially harmful and polluting materials such as sheep dip, pesticides, ammonia or biocides. If you handle, store or dispose of listed substances, <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 2 applies to you.</p>

<h3 id="smr-3---sewage-sludge">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 3 - sewage sludge</h3>

<p>The use of sewage sludge on farms is covered by <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 3. If you use sewage sludge on your land, <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 3 aims to ensure that there is no risk to human, animal or plant health and no harmful effects on soil.</p>

<p>You are restricted in how much sludge you can spread and when you should apply it. For example, you must not spread slurry on water-logged soil, or within 2 metres of the centre of a hedgerow or watercourse.</p>

<p>To find out more, see the guides on sewage sludge, slurry and silage and the Single Payment Scheme (SPS).</p>

<h3 id="smr-4---nitrate-vulnerable-zones">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 4 - Nitrate Vulnerable Zones</h3>

<p>These requirements aim to reduce the water pollution caused by nitrates from farms. It applies to you if your land is within an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>. </p>

<p>The Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008 came into force in England on 1 January 2009. The new rules are part of cross compliance as an <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr>. However, they are underpinned by separate legislation so are relevant to those not receiving <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> payments. Download the Environment Agency’s Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008 FAQs from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264237&amp;id=264238"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 89KB)</a>.</p>

<p>If you are claiming payment under the <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>, you could still be responsible for complying with the Regulations, even if you are not the occupier of the land. See the guide on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS).</p>

<p>For more details about cross compliance and <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>, see the guides on cross compliance: the basics, Statutory Management Requirements (SMR) and the Single Payment Scheme (SPS).</p>

<h2 id="catchment-sensitive-farming-and-nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Catchment Sensitive Farming and Nitrate Vulnerable Zones</h2>

<p>Farmers and land managers are legally required to tackle nitrate pollution and follow the requirements of the Nitrate Action Plan in <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>. Raised concentrations of nitrates can seriously affect the health and diversity of fresh and marine waters, and the plants and animals that live in them.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> areas have been chosen specifically to deal with nitrates, whereas Catchment Sensitive Farming (<abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr>) catchments consider the entire range of agricultural pollutants and their impact on sensitive aquatic habitats.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> are designated in accordance with the European Union legislation in the Nitrate Directive, which runs in conjunction with the Water Framework Directive, which lays down standards for other water pollutants. The Environment Agency enforces regulations under the <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> action plans, whilst the <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> Project uses a non-regulatory voluntary approach, using incentives, training and advice to encourage farmers to make beneficial changes. However, farmers within priority <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> catchments can often get training, advice and support enabling them to comply with <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> regulations.</p>

<p>Whereas the <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> action plan relates to a series of Environment Agency regulations, the <abbr title="England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative">ECSFDI</abbr> uses a voluntary approach, using incentives and advice to encourage farmers to make beneficial changes. However, farmers within priority <abbr title="Catchment Sensitive Farming">CSF</abbr> catchments can often get advice and support enabling them to comply with <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> regulations.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-nvzs">What are <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> are designated areas of land which drain to waters polluted by nitrates from agricultural land. These areas account for approximately 70% of England. If your land is in an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>, you need to follow rules set out in the Action Programme for <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> Action Programme promotes best practice in how you use and store fertiliser and manure through a regulatory approach. This builds on the guidelines set out in the Code for Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water. You can download the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) guide to water, air and soil protection from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=252412&amp;id=252413"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 1.37MB)</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr> are also covered by Statutory Management Requirement (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr>) 4 under cross compliance. You can also find out more in the guide on Statutory Management Requirements (SMR).</p>

<p>The Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008 are also part of cross compliance. You can download the Envionment Agency’s Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008 FAQs from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264237&amp;id=264238"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 89KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that if you are claiming payments under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>), you could still be responsible for complying with the Regulations, even if you are not the occupier of the land. See the guide on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS).</p>

<h3 id="land-outside-of-the-nvzs">Land outside of the <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Even if your land is outside the <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>, you should still follow the voluntary codes of good practice to protect the environment. They will help you to prevent nitrate levels rising to the point where regulation becomes necessary, as well as helping to reduce other pollution such as phosphate losses and microbiological contamination of bathing waters.</p>
