</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Buying or selling a home normally takes 2 to 3 months. If you’re part of a chain of buyers and sellers, the process can take longer.</p>

<p>There are several steps you’ll need to follow: </p>

<ul>
<li>sellers must provide an <a href="/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates" title="Buying or selling your home: Energy Performance Certificates">Energy Performance Certificate</a> for the property</li>
  <li>if a seller is using an <a href="/buy-sell-your-home/estate-agents" title="Buying or selling your home: Estate agents">estate agent</a>, potential buyers must make any offers through the agent</li>
  <li>once a buyer’s <a href="/buy-sell-your-home/offers" title="Buying or selling your home: Offers">offer</a> has been accepted, the seller is responsible for drawing up a legal contract to transfer ownership</li>
  <li>an offer isn’t legally binding until <a href="/buy-sell-your-home/transferring-ownership-conveyancing" title="Buying or selling your home: Transferring ownership (conveyancing)">contracts are exchanged</a>
</li>
  <li>depending on the amount given for property, the buyer may have to pay <a href="/buy-sell-your-home/stamp-duty-land-tax" title="Buying or selling your home: Stamp Duty Land Tax">Stamp Duty Land Tax</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This guide relates to England and Wales. Shelter has advice about <a href="http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/finding_a_place_to_live/buying_a_home" title="Shelter Scotland: Buying a home" rel="external">buying</a> and <a href="http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/finding_a_place_to_live/moving_home/selling_your_home" title="Shelter Scotland: Selling your home" rel="external">selling</a> a home in Scotland.</p>

</article><article id="energy-performance-certificates"><header><h1>Part 2: Energy Performance Certificates</h1>
  </header><p>Energy Performance Certificates (<abbr title="Energy Performance Certificates">EPCs</abbr>) are needed whenever a property is:</p>

<ul>
<li>built</li>
  <li>sold</li>
  <li>rented</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you’re selling or renting your home, you must order an <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> for potential buyers and tenants before you market your property.</p>
</div>

<p>In Scotland, you must display the <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> somewhere in the property - eg in the meter cupboard or next to the boiler.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>information about a property’s energy use and typical energy costs</li>
  <li>recommendations about how to reduce energy use and save money</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Energy Performance Certificates">EPCs</abbr> are valid for 10 years.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>An <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> gives a property an energy efficiency rating from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient).</p>
</div>

<h2>How to get an <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr>
</h2>
<p>If you’re selling or renting out your home, you’ll need to find an accredited assessor:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="https://www.epcregister.com/searchAssessor.html" title="Domestic Energy Performance Certificate Register website">England, Wales and Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Building/Building-standards/profinfo/epcintro/epcguidadvice" title="Scottish government approved organisations">Scotland</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They’ll assess your property and produce the certificate. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you don’t get an <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> when you need one, you can be fined.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re buying or renting then the person selling the house, the landlord or the letting agent must show you the <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Buildings that don’t need an <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr>
</h2>
<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>places of worship</li>
  <li>temporary buildings that will be used for less than 2 years</li>
  <li>stand-alone non-residential buildings with total useful floor space of less than 50 square metres</li>
  <li>industrial sites, workshops and non-residential agricultural buildings that don’t use a lot of energy</li>
  <li>some buildings that are due to be demolished</li>
  <li>holiday accommodation that’s rented out for less than 4 months a year or is let under a licence to occupy</li>
</ul>
<h2>See other properties’ <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificates">EPCs</abbr>
</h2>
<p>You can look at the <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificates">EPCs</abbr> of other properties free of charge. This lets you compare your home’s energy performance with that of similar homes. You can search by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.epcregister.com/reportSearchAddressTerms.html" title="Search for an EPC by address">property’s address</a> or by the <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.epcregister.com/searchReport.html" title="Search for an EPC by report reference number">report reference number.</a></p>

<p>If you don’t want other people to be able to see your <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> on the <abbr title="Energy Performance Certificate">EPC</abbr> register, you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.epcregister.com/opt-out" title="Opt out of displaying your EPC">opt out.</a></p>


</article><article id="estate-agents"><header><h1>Part 3: Estate agents</h1>
  </header><p>If you use an estate agent to sell your home, you must sign a legally binding contract with them.</p>

<p>You must stick to the terms of the contract or you could be taken to court.</p>

<p>Estate agents must also treat buyers fairly. They must show any <a href="offers" title="Buying or selling a home: Offers">offers</a> promptly and in writing to the person selling the house.</p>

<p>Estate agents are also legally obliged to pass on any other offers for the property right up to when contracts are exchanged.</p>

<h2>Complaints about estate agents</h2>
<p>All estate agents must belong to 1 of 2 schemes to deal with complaints:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.tpos.co.uk/index.htm" title="The Property Ombudsman">The Property Ombudsman</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.ombudsman-services.org/property.html" title="The Ombudsman Service">The Ombudsman Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before you complain to either scheme you must first complain to the estate agent and give them a fair chance to sort out the problem.</p>

</article><article id="offers"><header><h1>Part 4: Offers</h1>
  </header><p>If a home is sold through an <a href="estate-agents" title="Buying or selling a home: Estate agents">estate agent</a>, a buyer must make an offer through the agent.</p>

<p>For a private sale, a buyer makes their offer directly to the seller. </p>

<p>Buyers can make offers verbally (over the phone or in person) or in writing.</p>

<p>An offer isn’t legally binding in England and Wales until <a href="transferring-ownership-conveyancing" title="Buying or selling a home: Transferring ownership (conveyancing)">contracts are exchanged.</a></p>

<p>If a buyer makes an offer ‘subject to contract’, this means the price can still be negotiated (eg if a survey finds a problem with the property).</p>

</div>


</article><article id="transferring-ownership-conveyancing"><header><h1>Part 5: Transferring ownership (conveyancing)</h1>
  </header><h2>Once the offer is accepted</h2>
<p>The seller is responsible for drawing up a legal contract to transfer ownership. </p>

<p>The contract contains details about:</p>

<ul>
<li>the sale price</li>
  <li>the property boundaries</li>
  <li>which fixtures and fittings (like carpets and kitchen units) are included</li>
  <li>any legal restrictions or rights, like public footpaths or rules about using the property</li>
  <li>any planning restrictions</li>
  <li>services to the property, like drainage and gas</li>
  <li>when the sale will complete</li>
</ul>
<p>If the seller has hired a solicitor or conveyancer, they will:</p>

<ul>
<li>draft the initial contract</li>
  <li>answer questions from the buyer’s solicitor or conveyancer (with the seller’s help)</li>
  <li>negotiate the details of the contract if necessary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exchanging contracts</h2>
<p>When the buyer and seller are happy with the contract, both sides sign final copies and send them to each other.</p>

<p>Once this happens, the agreement to sell and buy is legally binding. Usually neither party can pull out without paying compensation.</p>

<h2>Completion</h2>
<p>Once you exchange contracts and deal with any remaining checks the buyer has asked for:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The money is transferred from the buyer to the seller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legal documents needed to transfer ownership are handed over to the buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seller moves out and leaves the property in the state agreed in the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seller hands over the keys to the buyer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property now belongs to the buyer.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</article><article id="buying-with-other-people"><header><h1>Part 6: Buying with other people</h1>
  </header><p>Legal ownership of a home can be arranged between 2 or more people, as ‘joint tenants’ or ‘tenants in common’. The maximum number of legal owners is 4.</p>

<p>There are rules depending on the type of ownership you choose. For example, if you buy as ‘joint tenants’, you can’t pass on your share of the property in your will. Instead, it automatically goes to the other joint owners.</p>

</div>


</article><article id="stamp-duty-land-tax"><header><h1>Part 7: Stamp Duty Land Tax</h1>
  </header><p>If you buy property for more than £125,000, you pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>) of between 1% and 7% on the whole purchase price.</p>

<p>If you pay £125,000 or less, you <strong>don’t</strong> pay any <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>.</p>
