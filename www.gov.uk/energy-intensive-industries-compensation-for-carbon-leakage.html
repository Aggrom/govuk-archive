<h2 id="overview-of-the-compensation-scheme-for-energy-intensive-industries">Overview of the compensation scheme for energy-intensive industries</h2>

<p>Policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions are going to impact upon the bills faced by industrial consumers. This will have the greatest effect on those industries that use the most electricity, leading to a risk that investment in the UK is lost – carbon leakage. The government intends to compensate those businesses most at risk of carbon leakage, to help offset these increased costs.</p>

<p>In his Autumn Statement on the 29 November 2011 the Chancellor announced that the government intends to implement measures to reduce the impact of policy on the costs of electricity for the most electricity-intensive industries, beginning in 2013 and worth around £250 million over the Spending Review period.</p>

<p>As part of this the government has committed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>compensate key electricity-intensive businesses to help offset the indirect cost of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consult_carbon_price_support.htm">Carbon Price Floor</a> and the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm">EU Emissions Trading System</a>, subject to <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/europe/state-aid">state aid guidelines</a>
</li>
  <li>increase the level of relief from the climate change levy on electricity for Climate Change Agreement participants from 65 to 90%</li>
</ul>
<p>To support this, in March 2012 BIS and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (<abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>) launched Compensation for the indirect costs of the Carbon Price Floor and EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) - call for evidence. This asked companies and trade bodies to engage actively and share information and data on their electricity-intensity, in order to help government target compensation effectively. It closed on 4 May 2012.</p>

<p>Additionally, and separate to the call for evidence, the government has also committed to explore options for reducing the impact of electricity costs on electricity-intensive industries as a result of electricity market reform policies where this has a significant impact on their competitiveness, and subject to value for money and state aid considerations.</p>

<p>In October 2012 BIS and <abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> launched a consultation on a proposal setting out the eligibility and design of the scheme to compensate energy intensive industries for the indirect costs of EU ETS and the Carbon Price Floor. See the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/Consultations/energy-intensive-industries-compensation-scheme">Energy intensive industry compensation consultation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>If you have a question about the package, or the call for evidence, or would like to register your interest please contact us: <a href="mailto:energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk">energyintensiveindustries@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>

<h3 id="how-long-is-the-process-of-designing-the-compensation-scheme-going-to-take-before-a-firm-announcement-can-be-made">How long is the process of designing the compensation scheme going to take before a firm announcement can be made?</h3>

<p>We expect to make an announcement in March 2013, although compensation may be made later than this. This is because any compensation to companies is subject to state aid considerations which can take up to two years. The government is engaging with the Commission early and regularly, aiming to shorten the state aid timescale as much as is possible.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-this-package-be-delivered">When will this package be delivered?</h3>

<p>The government’s intention is that this package will start to be implemented in 2013, subject to state aid clearance. Eligibility for Indirect Compensation for indirect EU Emissions Trading System costs will be based on EU guidance, which was issued in May 2012. Compensation for indirect Carbon Price Floor costs is also state aid, and is therefore subject to Commission approval.</p>

<p>The reduced rate of the climate change levy, for those sectors who have signed Climate Change Agreements, from 35 to 10 per cent on electricity. This will only take effect from 1 April 2013, subject to legislation in the Finance Bill 2012.</p>

<h3 id="does-the-package-remove-the-incentive-for-these-companies-to-become-more-energy-efficient-in-the-future">Does the package remove the incentive for these companies to become more energy efficient in the future?</h3>

<p>Energy will continue to be a major cost for energy intensive companies, incentivising them to become more efficient. These industries will continue to have a vital role to play in the UK economy. They need to adapt to lower carbon means of production where possible, but it is equally important that they remain competitive and that the UK remains an attractive location for them.</p>

<h3 id="what-effects-does-this-package-have-on-carbon-emissions">What effects does this package have on carbon emissions?</h3>

<p>Carbon emissions from electricity (power generation) are constrained by the EU ETS cap. This package will compensate for the increase in the indirect costs associated with the carbon price floor and the EU ETS, but will not affect the environmental integrity of the cap. Sectors who will receive an increased CCL rebate will be bound by the targets of their CCA agreements which encourage energy efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-electricity-market-reform-emr">What about Electricity Market Reform (<abbr title="Electricity Market Reform">EMR</abbr>)?</h3>

<p>The government has also committed to explore options for reducing the impact of electricity costs on electricity-intensive industries as a result of electricity market reform policies, where this has a significant impact on their competitiveness. This is also subject to value for money and state aid consideration. For more information on <abbr title="Electricity Market Reform">EMR</abbr>, visit the <abbr title="Electricity Market Reform">EMR</abbr> page on the <abbr title="Department for Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> web site.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>There are a number of documents and reports that enable a greater understanding of the role of energy intensive industries as we transition to a green economy and the impact that energy and climate change policy has on them. This page will be regularly updated with documentation relevant to energy intensive industries.</p>

<h2 id="energy-intensive-industry-sub-group-of-the-green-economy-council">Energy Intensive Industry Sub-Group of the Green Economy Council</h2>

<p>The Energy Intensive Industries Group was created by the Green Economy Council. Its original purpose was to bring together evidence on how Energy Intensive Industries are affected by energy and climate change policies and was tasked with coming forward with ideas for policy proposals. This led to the development of the Energy Intensive Industries package announced by the Chancellor in his 2011 autumn statement. Going forward the role of the group remains to support the work of the Council by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advising on issues for energy intensive industries around green and climate change policies, including, issues around competitiveness, business opportunities and challenges, so that the Government’s strategic approach properly reflects short, medium and long term needs of businesses.</li>
  <li>Discussing and, where appropriate, identifying action for energy intensive industries.</li>
  <li>Acting as a mechanism for energy intensive industries to bring forward issues relating to the green economy which affect business, including views on what further Government policies are needed to ensure the development of the green economy and to facilitate green growth.</li>
  <li>Supporting the development of the Energy Intensive Industries Package by informing the proposal for carbon price and EU Emissions Trading Scheme compensation.</li>
  <li>Reporting at regular intervals to the Green Economy Council on the work of the group.</li>
</ul>
