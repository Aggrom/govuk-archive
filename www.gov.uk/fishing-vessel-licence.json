You will acquire licence entitlement if you buy a vessel with or without its licence. You may also buy an existing separate licence entitlement.\r\n\r\nYou must apply to your local Marine Management Organisation (MMO) - using form AFL7 'Establishment or transfer of an entitlement and transfer of a licence' - to transfer the licence into your name before you can apply for a licence.\r\n\r\nOnce the licence entitlement is in your name, you need to convert it into a fishing licence. To do this you must send the following to your local MMO:\r\n\r\n- your valid certificate of registry\r\n- form AFL2 'Application for a fishing licence for a British registered fishing vessel'\r\n- completed AFL7 showing you as the entitlement holder\r\n\r\nYou must send the original documents, not copies. Your local MMO office will try to process your application within five working days.\r\n\r\nThe type of licence you need depends on the size of your vessel and the category your fishing activities fall into.\r\n\r\nVessels are divided into two groups for licensing purposes - those that are:\r\n\r\n- 10 metres and under in overall length\r\n- over 10 metres in overall length\r\n\r\nThe three licence categories are:\r\n\r\n- Category A - authorises vessels to fish for all available quota stocks and up to a restricted tonnage for combined pelagic stocks\r\n- Category B - authorises vessels over 10 metres to fish for a restricted range of quota stocks and a restricted tonnage of combined pelagic stocks\r\n- Category C - authorises vessels over 10 metres to fish for a range of miscellaneous stocks and a restricted tonnage of combined pelagic stocks\r\n\r\nYou do not need a fishing licence if:\r\n\r\n- you only fish for salmon or migratory trout\r\n- your vessel is 10 metres or less in length and you only fish for common eels\r\n- you only fish within the 12 nautical mile limits around Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man - you should contact the relevant authority for advice about their licensing requirements\r\n- you only use your vessel for carrying anglers who are fishing for pleasure\r\n\r\n*[RSS]: Registry of Shipping and Seamen\r\n*[MMO]: Marine Management Organisation (MMO)\r\n","updated_at":"2012-10-08T09:46:53+00:00"}],["tags",[{"title":"Licences and licence applications","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business%2Flicences.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Applying for licences from your council for events and businesses","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Flicences","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/licences"},"parent":{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}},{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null},{"title":"Maritime vessels and work at sea","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business%2Fmaritime.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes health and safety onboard, crew, registering vessels","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business%2Fmaritime","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/maritime"},"parent":{"title":"Business","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/business.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Information about starting up and running a business in the UK, including help if you're self employed or a sole trader.","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=business","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/business"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[]]],"parts":null}
