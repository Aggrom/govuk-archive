<h2 id="what-is-the-national-standard">What is the National Standard?</h2>

<p>The National Standard is built upon similar principles to training for motorcycle riders and car drivers, teaching the importance of assessing the likely risks faced by road users.  Launched in 2005, the National Standard was developed by over 20 organisations and is maintained by the Department for Transport.</p>

<h3 id="the-national-standard-and-bikeability">The National Standard and Bikeability</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> promotes the National Standard through the Bikeability award scheme in England. Any cycle training organisation wishing to use the Bikeability branding and issue the Bikeability award materials to trainees must first register a scheme. Scheme registration is part of a quality assurance process to help ensure organisations are delivering good practice cycle training. </p>

<p>All Bikeability registered schemes have gone through the registration process.</p>

<p>Further information about Bikeability and details of how to register as a Bikeability provider can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability">Bikeability website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="delivering-the-national-standard-for-cycle-training">Delivering the National Standard for Cycle Training</h2>

<p>National Standard/Bikeability training may only be delivered by National Standard Instructors (<abbr title="National Standard Instructors">NSIs</abbr>), who have successfully completed a <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> recognised instructor training course. From 1 January 2011, Instructor Training Organisations (<abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr>) are the only bodies recognised by Government as providers of training for National Standard Instructor Trainers, Instructors and Assistant Instructors.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="National Standard Instructors">NSIs</abbr> are issued with an <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> number. The National Standard Instructor database contains a record of every instructor holding an <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> number. The database is managed by Steer Davies Gleave on behalf of the Department for Transport. </p>

<p>Any further queries may be e mailed to <a href="mailto:nsi@sdgworld.net">nsi@sdgworld.net</a>. </p>

<h2 id="national-standard-instructors">National Standard Instructors</h2>

<p>The National Standard Instructor courses teach individuals to deliver National Standard training. There are four National Standard Instructor courses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assistant</li>
  <li>Assistant to provisional Instructor conversion course</li>
  <li>Instructor</li>
  <li>Instructor-Trainer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assistant">Assistant</h3>

<p>Delivery of the National Standard at Levels 1 and 2 can be supported by Assistant National Standard Instructor (<abbr title="Assistant National Standard Instructors">NSIAs</abbr>) who may teach Levels 1 and 2 if supervised on site by an Instructor. A maximum of two <abbr title="Assistant National Standard Instructors">NSIAs</abbr> can be supervised on site by one Instructor. The <abbr title="Assistant National Standard Instructor">NSIA</abbr> course is delivered over two days. Upon successful completion of the course assessment, the individual will achieve <abbr title="Assistant National Standard Instructor">NSIA</abbr> recognition.</p>

<h3 id="instructor">Instructor</h3>

<p>To lead and deliver National Standard cycle training sessions, instructors must have successfully completed a recognised National Standard Instructor course. The Instructor course is taught over four days (two days if converting from assistant to instructor). Candidates who complete the 4-day course successfully are recognised as provisional Instructors (NSIP). </p>

<p>Within six months of completing the 4-day course, provisional instructors should undertake a post-course assessment. On successful completion of the post-course assessment, the instructor will become a fully qualified instructor (<abbr title="National Standard Instructor Qualified">NSIQ</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="instructor-trainer">Instructor-Trainer</h3>

<p>The National Standard Instructor Trainer (<abbr title="National Standard Instructor-Trainer">NSIT</abbr>) course was published in 2010. The <abbr title="National Standard Instructor-Trainer">NSIT</abbr> course is taught over two days, with candidates achieving provisional <abbr title="National Standard Instructor-Trainer">NSIT</abbr> recognition upon successful completion of the 2-day course. Like the <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> course, there is a post-course assessment element to be completed following the initial course. </p>

<p>Course participants must be fully qualified <abbr title="National Standard Instructors">NSIs</abbr> (<abbr title="National Standard Instructor Qualified">NSIQ</abbr>) before they are eligible to undertake the <abbr title="National Standard Instructor-Trainer">NSIT</abbr> course. <abbr title="National Standard Instructor-Trainers">NSITs</abbr> may only deliver instructor training if they are working for a recognised <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="national-standard-instructor-numbers">National Standard Instructor Numbers</h2>

<p>National Standard Instructor (<abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr>) numbers are given to candidates who successfully complete an instructor course. <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> numbers were in the past known as CTSB numbers. The National Standard Instructor database contains a record of every instructor holding an <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> number. The database is managed by Steer Davies Gleave on behalf of the Department for Transport. </p>

<p><abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> numbers are issued directly to individuals once their Instructor Training Organisation has sent the required details to Steer Davies Gleave.  </p>

<h3 id="delivering-inclusive-cycle-training---a-good-practice-guide-for-disability-cycle-training">Delivering Inclusive Cycle Training - A Good Practice Guide for Disability Cycle Training</h3>

<p>The Guide provides advice to National Standard Instructors on how to help disabled people achieve National Standard outcomes. The Guide aims to equip instructors with the knowledge, confidence and potential strategies they might need to deliver effective cycle training to people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The Guide was developed in consultation with a number of experts in the field, however, it is not possible to provide generic, clear-cut advice on how to train every individual. The Guide therefore provides ideas for consideration and the means to identify what training methods, techniques and equipment might be appropriate for any specific situation.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="instructor-training-organisations">Instructor Training Organisations</h2>

<p>Instructor Training Organisations are at the centre of the system to enhance and maintain the quality of National Standard Instructor training in England.</p>

<p>Instructor Training Organisations (<abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr>) are the only bodies recognised by Government as providers of training for National Standard Instructor Trainers, Instructors and Assistant Instructors. </p>

<p>All <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> have been through a comprehensive application process to assess their ability to deliver National Standard Instructor training and provide membership services to instructors. <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr>’ training and management will be reviewed periodically by the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> are responsible for training new instructors and for providing existing instructors with opportunities for continuing professional development and updates to the National Standard for cycle training. <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> are required to provide membership services to help ensure the standard of cycle training delivered by National Standard Instructors is maintained after the initial 4-day course and post-course assessment.</p>

<p>Only instructors trained by <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> will be issued with National Standard Instructor (<abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr>) numbers, which identify them as providing cycle training that meets the National Standard.</p>

<p>Cycle training schemes registered with Bikeability must use National Standard Instructors who are members of an <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr> to deliver training. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> grant for cycle training will only be payable to eligible schemes if they are using instructors who are members of an <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr> to deliver the cycle training.
A list of <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability/wp-content/uploads/120502_Cycling_Instructor_Training_Organisations_list1.doc">Bikeability website</a>.  </p>

<h3 id="membership-for-instructors">Membership for instructors</h3>

<p>Instructors who deliver cycle training for a Bikeability scheme must register for membership with a <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> recognised <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr>. This includes freelance instructors and those who work for private organisations that may be delivering training on behalf of a Bikeability Local Authority or School Games Organiser Host School that receives <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> cycle training grant.</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/membership-instructors-faq/">Frequently asked questions</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-1--select-an-instructor-training-organisation">Step 1 – select an Instructor Training Organisation</h3>
<p>There are a number of <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> that have been recognised by the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> as delivering National Standard Instructor training.
All <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> are required to deliver the four day instructor course. At present not all <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> provide the assistant instructor course, assistant to instructor conversion course or instructor trainer course.</p>

<h3 id="step-2--attend-instructor-training-course">Step 2 – attend instructor training course</h3>
<p>The full National Standard Instructor course takes four days to complete (two days if converting from assistant to instructor). The assistant instructor course is shorter and takes two days. Some <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> allow the four days to split over two weeks. The cost of the courses may vary slightly among the <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr>, but is generally around £500 for the four day course. Post course assessments may also be required, see step 4 for further details.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-instructor-qualification">Step 3 –instructor qualification</h3>
<p>Candidates will be issued with an <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> number upon successful completion of their instructor course. The <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> number certifies that a candidate has attended and passed an instructor course as delivered by a recognised <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr>. However, post course assessments may also be required, see step 4 for further details.</p>

<h3 id="step-4--post-course-assessment">Step 4 – post-course assessment</h3>
<p>Candidates who have passed a four-day National Standard Instructor course should receive a post-course assessment from their <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr> within six months of achieving the provisional qualification. Once a candidate has been post-course assessed and has been approved by their <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr>, they will become recognised as a qualified National Standard Instructor. Candidates will receive an updated <abbr title="National Standard Instructor">NSI</abbr> number to reflect this status.</p>

<p>There is no post-course assessment requirement for those undertaking the assistant instructor course, although <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisations">ITOs</abbr> may make this a requirement at their discretion. </p>

<h2 id="how-to-become-an-instructor-training-organisation">How to become an Instructor Training Organisation</h2>

<p>There is no set timetable for <abbr title="Instructor Training Organisation">ITO</abbr> recruitment campaigns. However, the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> will review the need and timing of any future application process on a regular basis.</p>

<h2 id="national-standard-outcomes">National Standard Outcomes</h2>

<p>There are three National Standard levels. There are a series of outcomes for each level that a trainee must demonstrate. Each level and its outcomes is set out below.</p>

<h3 id="level-1">Level 1</h3>

<p>This is usually covered in a traffic free environment. Those completing Level 1 will be able to demonstrate the skills and understanding to be able to make a trip and undertake activities safely in a traffic free environment. </p>

<p>Provided, are the basic cycle control skills including starting and pedalling, stopping, manoeuvring, signalling and using the gears. It can be taught to anyone (usually aged five and over) but it is most often taught to groups of children aged seven to nine in the school playground over one or two sessions.</p>

<p>Those completing Level 1 will demonstrate the skills and understanding to be able to make a trip and undertake activities safely in a motor traffic free environment and as a pre-requisite to a road trip.</p>

<p>The following outcomes must be demonstrated at level 1:</p>
