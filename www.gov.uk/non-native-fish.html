<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Regulations and controls exist to protect native wildlife species and habitats from threats caused by non-native species being introduced. Non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea can carry and spread diseases to which native species have no defence. They can also prey on native species and other animals, and upset the natural ecological balance.</p>

<p>There are special legal controls in the UK to protect native fish, mollusc and crustacea populations from damage caused when non-native varieties are introduced into their habitats. These controls aim to prevent both deliberate and accidental introductions of non-native species by ensuring that only people covered by an appropriate licence can keep or introduce them.</p>

<p>This guide explains the regulations and licensing requirements that apply to non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea. It covers the type of licence you need depending on the nature of your business and the species involved, and also explains the application process.</p>

<h2 id="legal-controls-for-non-native-fish-mollusc-crustacea-species">Legal controls for non-native fish, mollusc, crustacea species</h2>

<p>The following legislation exists to protect the environment, and native fish, mollusc and crustacea species from the harm caused by unauthorised releases of non-native species.</p>

<h3 id="wildlife-and-countryside-act">Wildlife and Countryside Act</h3>

<p>The Wildlife and Countryside Act (<abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr>) 1981 makes it an offence for anyone without a licence to release a non-native animal into the wild in Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>), or to allow one to escape. For example, it would be an offence under the Act to introduce non-native fish into a pond from which they could potentially escape into the wild.</p>

<h3 id="alien-species-in-aquaculture">Alien Species in Aquaculture</h3>

<p>The Alien and Locally Absent Species in Aquaculture Regulations 2011 control the use of non-native and locally absent species on farms. Applications are considered in conjunction with <a href="/fish-and-shellfish-farm-authorisation-and-registration" title="APB Authorisation">authorisation</a> as an aquaculture production business for the purpose of farming . Each species is assessed against the risk posed and the security of the receiving site. Where the species involved is new to the aquaculture industry in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> the applicant may be required to present background on the risk posed by the species with their application. The <a rel="external" href="http://www.cefas.defra.gov.uk/our-services/aquaculture/fish-health-inspectorate.aspx" title="Fish Health Inspectorate">Fish Health Inspectorate</a> (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>)  will provide additional information following an enquiry.</p>

<h3 id="specific-controls-on-fish-and-crayfish">Specific controls on fish and crayfish</h3>

<p>Additional legislation exists to provide further protection for native fish and crayfish species. It is an offence for anyone without a licence to keep or introduce crayfish or specific named species of non-native fish into any water in England and Wales, under the Import of Live Fish Act 1980 (<abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr>). ‘Any water’ includes tanks, pools and ponds.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1-Leaflet.pdf">Download a list of controlled non-native fish species from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website (PDF, 181KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lobster-deposit-order">Lobster Deposit Order</h3>

<p>This legislation exists to protect UK lobster stocks by preventing the introduction and spread of non-native lobsters and their diseases. The legislation applies to the following types of lobster:</p>

<ul>
<li>European lobster (Homarus gammarus)</li>
  <li>American or Canadian lobster (Homarus americanus)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan to introduce or deposit lobsters in the UK – whether they are alive or dead – then you must comply with the legislation and obtain a licence where necessary. There are two types of licence in England and Wales, a general licence and an individual licence. </p>

<h2 id="licences-for-keeping-and-introducing-non-native-fish-mollusc-and-crustacea">Licences for keeping and introducing non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea</h2>

<p>Under legislation designed to protect native fish, mollusc, crustacea and other wildlife, you will need a licence to:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep controlled non-native species of fish and crayfish or introduce them into an inland water – because it is granted under the Import of Live Fish (England and Wales) Act (<abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr>), this is known as an <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence</li>
  <li>introduce all non-native fish into the wild – because it is granted under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, this is known as a <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence</li>
  <li>farm non-native or locally absent species – granted under The Alien and Locally Absent Species in Aquaculture Regulations 2011 which are commonly known as the Alien Species Regulation hence an ASR permit</li>
  <li>hold lobsters - controlled under the Lobsters (Control of Deposit) Order 1981 and known as lobster deposit licences</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ilfa-licence">
<abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licensing system applies to any non-native fish species listed under the legislation and all crayfish except the red claw crayfish (cherax quadricarinatus). You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1-Leaflet.pdf">download a list of controlled non-native fish species from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 19KB)</a>.</p>

<p>Those wishing to keep the listed species -  including fish dealers, fishery owners, researchers, public display aquariums, wholesalers, retailers and hobbyists - may require an individual licence to do so.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to introduce non-native fish that are not on the controlled list, or crayfish, you don’t need an <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence, but you may need a <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence.</p>

<h3 id="wca-licence">
<abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence is required to introduce all non-native species into the wild. If you need to obtain an <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence to introduce a controlled species then that licence will also provide <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> approval. If the species is not on the controlled under <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr>, you only need a <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence.</p>

<p>‘The wild’ includes fisheries and any other waters where you couldn’t easily recover all examples of an introduced non-native species. Any water from which the fish could escape into an open watercourse, or waters connected to a continuous body of water, is also considered ‘wild’. In general it’s only small, fully enclosed sites from which fish can easily be recovered that are considered not to be the wild.</p>

<h3 id="asr-permit">ASR permit</h3>

<p>Permission to farm non-native species is considered alongside applications to be authorised as an Aquaculture Production Business.  Each species is assessed against the risk posed and the security of the receiving site.  </p>

<p>Where the species involved is new to the aquaculture industry in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> the applicant may be required to present background on the risk posed by the species with their application.  The <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will provide additional information following an enquiry.</p>

<h3 id="lobster-deposit">Lobster deposit</h3>

<p>Special legislation exists to protect UK lobster stocks by preventing the introduction and spread of non-native lobsters and their diseases. The legislation applies to the following types of lobster:</p>

<ul>
<li>European lobster (Homarus gammarus)</li>
  <li>American or Canadian lobster (Homarus americanus)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan to introduce or deposit lobsters in the UK – whether they are alive or dead – then you must comply with the legislation and obtain a licence where necessary. There are two types of licence in England and Wales, a general licence and an individual licence.</p>

<p>A general licence is in place to cover certain situations where lobsters are introduced or deposited. Under its arrangements you don’t need to make an individual application for a licence if you intend to deposit or introduce:</p>

<ul>
<li>European lobsters that have not been kept in tanks or systems that contain – or have contained – American or Canadian lobsters</li>
  <li>European or Canadian lobsters to be held on the site where they will be consumed, provided that none of the water in which they are held, nor any lobster waste, is discharged into tidal waters</li>
  <li>European or American lobsters that are canned, frozen, or prepared in some other way</li>
  <li>American lobsters deposited at a site that is more than one mile away from tidal waters</li>
</ul>
<p>If you intend to introduce or deposit lobsters in England and Wales in any situation not covered by the general licence above, then you will need an individual licence from the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="section-30-consent">Section 30 consent</h3>

<p>Section 30 consent
is written consent that you must get from the Environment Agency before you may introduce any fish - including non-native species - into inland waters other than fish farms.</p>

<h3 id="crayfish-trapping">Crayfish trapping</h3>
<p>If you want to trap and remove non-native crayfish from waters in England or Wales you can apply for written permission from the Environment Agency. It is also your responsibility to get the necessary consent from the land owner. If the local conditions are suitable then the Environment Agency may grant permission.</p>

<p>Be aware that you cannot re-introduce non-native crayfish that you catch to any waters without a licence to do so.</p>

<p>You can find out about getting permission to trap non-native crayfish on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/fishing/38051.aspx">Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="which-licence-do-i-need">Which licence do I need?</h2>
<p>The licences that you need in order to keep or introduce non-native fish, mollusc and crustacea depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the nature of your business and/or the waters you’re introducing the animals to</li>
  <li>whether the fish are on the list of controlled non-native species - <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1-Leaflet.pdf">download a list of controlled non-native fish species from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 19KB)</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="licences-to-keep-and-introduce-non-native-fish-molluscs-and-crustacea">Licences to keep and introduce non-native fish, molluscs and crustacea</h3>

<p>The licences that you may need to keep and introduce non-native animals may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence</li>
  <li>the ASR licence</li>
  <li>Lobster deposit</li>
  <li>‘Section 30’ consent</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introducing-and-keeping-non-native-species-in-the-wild-including-fisheries">Introducing and keeping non-native species in the wild, including fisheries</h3>

<p>If you introduce controlled non-native fish, molluscs or crustacea species into the wild you will need all of the following licences:</p>

<ul>
<li>an individual <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence</li>
  <li>a Section 30 consent</li>
</ul>
<p>If the species you introduce is not on the controlled list, you will need a <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence but not an <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence. Section 30 consent is required for movements of all fish into a river or stillwater fishery.</p>

<p>‘The wild’ includes fisheries and any other waters where all examples of an introduced non-native species could not easily be recovered. Any water from which animals could escape into an open watercourse, or waters connected to a continuous body of water, is also considered ‘wild’.</p>

<h3 id="fish-farms">Fish farms</h3>

<p>Authorised fish, mollusc and crustacea farms may require the following licences to introduce and keep non-native fish to their waters:</p>

<ul>
<li>an ASR permit and a <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> licence, if the waters the fish are held in are considered to be wild</li>
</ul>
<p>Fish farms don’t need Section 30 consent.</p>

<h3 id="non-native-crayfish-kept-for-direct-supply-for-human-consumption">Non-native crayfish kept for direct supply for human consumption</h3>

<p>A general licence exists for outlets like fishmongers and restaurants to allow them to keep non-native crayfish for direct human consumption. They can keep non-native species temporarily before transferring them for human consumption, while hotels and restaurants can keep them to serve to their customers.</p>

<p>As long as the crayfish are held securely, and any unused crayfish are dead before disposal, the general licence will cover these activities and you won’t need to make an individual licence application.</p>

<h3 id="ornamental-fish-and-crayfish-wholesalers-and-retailers">Ornamental fish and crayfish wholesalers and retailers</h3>

<p>If you sell controlled non-native fish species on a wholesale or retail basis you require an individual <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence. The general licensing provisions do not apply in the case of wholesalers and retailers.</p>

<p>The only species of crayfish permitted in the ornamental trade is the red claw crayfish (cherax quadricarinatus).  Their keeping in heated indoor aquarium is covered by the general licensing terms.</p>

<h3 id="garden-ponds-and-ornamental-aquaria">Garden ponds and ornamental aquaria</h3>

<p>General licensing arrangements apply in the following situations, meaning that you don’t need an individual <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence if you keep:</p>

<ul>
<li>grass carp, sturgeon/sterlet and ameiurid (ictalurid) catfish in a garden pond or indoor aquarium</li>
  <li>red shiners and fathead minnows (roseyreds) in an indoor aquarium</li>
</ul>
<p>A garden pond means a self-contained and isolated body of water covering no more than one acre on private residential premises. There must be no risk that the fish could escape into the wild, and it must not be used for fishing or any commercial purpose related to fish rearing or dealing.</p>

<p>To keep controlled non-native fish in any other situation, including a pond or aquarium in a wholesale or retail outlet, you will need an individual <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-your-licence">Applying for your licence</h2>

<p>The introduction and keeping of non-native and locally absent species on fish farms are made and considered in conjunction with farm authorisation.  Applications are made on an <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-AW1.pdf">AW1 form</a>.</p>

<p>Applications to introduce and keep controlled non-native fish species are made on form ILFA1 Download form <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-ILFA1.pdf" title="ILFA1 Form">ILFA1</a> from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 88KB).  Where appropriate this application will also cover <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> permissions</p>

<p>Applications to keep non-native crayfish are made on a <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-CRAY2.pdf">CRAY2</a>  form and where appropriate covers <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Applications to deposit lobsters are made on a <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-Lobster-Deposit.pdf">FIS9</a> form.  </p>

<p>You will need to provide various details on the form, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>information about yourself</li>
  <li>what species the fish are</li>
  <li>where the fish will come from</li>
  <li>where the fish will be kept, and key details about the location</li>
  <li>the purpose of the introduction</li>
</ul>
<p>You will only be issued with a licence if the species is considered to be appropriate, and if security at your site is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-will-the-licensing-process-take">How long will the licensing process take?</h3>

<p>How long it takes for your licence to be processed depends on your business type. If you’re a retailer, hobbyist or wholesaler applying for a licence to trade in ornamental non-native fish then your application will be processed within the timescales set by the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>. For guidance on how long the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will take to process your application, <a rel="external" href="http://www.cefas.defra.gov.uk/media/510230/fish-health-inspectorate-cc.pdf">download the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> citizen’s charter from the Cefas website (PDF, 51KB)</a>.</p>

<p>However other applications can take up to 90 days before a licence is issued, particularly if it’s necessary to consult with organisations such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales</li>
  <li>the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="offences-and-penalties">Offences and penalties</h3>

<p>Under the Prohibition of Keeping or Release of Live Fish (Specified Species) Order 1998 and the Prohibition of Keeping of Live Fish (Crayfish) Order 1996, you’re committing an offence if you hold, keep or release species that are on the <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> list without holding an <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence. It’s also an offence if you fail to meet the conditions of your <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence, including supplying an <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> listed species to someone who doesn’t have an appropriate <abbr title="Live Fish (England and Wales) Act">ILFA</abbr> licence.</p>

<p>Your licence could be revoked if you fail to comply with licence conditions, and you could be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £2,500. Depending on the circumstances, illegally stocked fish may be removed and destroyed.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Wildlife and Countryside Act">WCA</abbr> 1981, you’re committing an offence if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>deliberately release any non-native fish into the wild</li>
  <li>allow non-native fish to escape into the wild</li>
</ul>
<p>You face a fine if you’re found guilty of this offence.</p>

<p>Under ASR offences include the abandonment, release or allowing the permitted animals to escape - unless you can provide evidence of the reasonable steps taken to avoid this.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-section-30-consent">Applying for Section 30 consent</h3>

<p>You need to get Section 30 consent from the Environment Agency before you move any fish into a river or stillwater fishery. See fish movements into inland waters in the guide on <a href="/moving-fish-and-shellfish">moving fish and shellfish</a>.</p>
