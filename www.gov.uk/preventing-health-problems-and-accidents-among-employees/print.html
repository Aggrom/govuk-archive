  </header><p>You must do everything you reasonably can to prevent employees from having health problems and accidents in the workplace.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>These rules also apply to employees who work from home or from different locations.</p>

<p>Health problems and accidents can be caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>materials</li>
  <li>equipment</li>
  <li>working practices</li>
</ul>
<h2>Health and safety actions</h2>

<p>You can help prevent health problems and accidents by:</p>

<ul>
<li>carrying out a <a href="/carrying-out-health-and-safety-risk-assessments" title="Carry out a risk assessment">risk assessment</a>
</li>
  <li>controlling, reducing and monitoring the use of <a href="/manage-hazardous-substances-in-your-business" title="Control and monitor the use of hazardous substances">hazardous substances</a>

</ul></article><article id="manual-handling"><header><h1>Part 2: Manual handling</h1>
  </header><p>Manual handling means lifting or carrying loads without mechanical assistance - ie using your arms and/or legs.</p>

<p>This can be hazardous when:</p>

<ul>
<li>a load is too heavy, large or difficult to grasp</li>
  <li>lifting involves awkward movements</li>
  <li>lifting takes place in difficult conditions - eg on slippery or uneven floors, or in extreme temperatures</li>
</ul>
<p>Where manual handling under these conditions is unavoidable, you must: </p>

<ul>
<li>minimise and if possible get rid of the need for it</li>
  <li>assess any risk of injury </li>
  <li>reduce any risk of injury as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to avoid manual handling</h2>

<p>If you don’t have automated or mechanical tools (eg conveyers or pallet trucks) to help with lifting or moving loads, consider getting some. If you don’t you must find other ways to avoid manual handling health problems and accidents, eg by <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/msd/mac/index.htm" title="Assess the risk of lifting and carrying ">assessing</a> and reducing the risk to your staff.</p>

</article><article id="hazardous-substances"><header><h1>Part 3: Hazardous substances</h1>
  </header><p>If your employees must work with hazardous substances as part of their job, you must take steps to safeguard their health.</p>

<p>Industries like manufacturing and motor vehicle repair pose clear risks, but many other jobs - eg hairdressing and catering - can also expose workers to hazardous substances.</p>

<p>There are a clear-cut <a href="/how-to-prevent-and-manage-major-environmental-incidents/" title="Hazardous substances: the rules for businesses">set of rules on protecting your employees</a> from these risks. </p>

<p>For further information download the Health and Safety Executive’s brochure on controlling hazardous substances.</p>

</article><article id="slip-and-trip-hazards"><header><h1>Part 4: Slip and trip hazards</h1>
  </header><p>You must make sure that your employees are safe when they move around your premises by checking all areas that could cause them to slip or trip.</p>

<h2>Flooring</h2>
<p>You must check for any hazards including loose, cracked or worn flooring, and replace where necessary. Look out for other hazards such as liquid, grease, dirt or dust on floors, and promptly clean up any you find.</p>

<p>Choose your flooring according to how the area will be used.</p>

<h2>Lighting</h2>
<p>Maintain lighting so employees can clearly see any obstructions or other hazards like wet or slippery floors, or steps.</p>

<p>You must also clean the lighting regularly and change bulbs when needed.</p>

<h2>Cluttered areas</h2>
<p>Clear clutter from floors and doorways. If some things can’t be moved out of the way, put up notices to warn staff.</p>

<h2>Footwear</h2>
<p>You must give your employees footwear if it’s necessary to protect their safety. If they work in areas where floors can’t be kept dry, for example, they must have non-slip shoes or boots.</p>

<p>If footwear is supplied as personal protective equipment (<abbr title="Personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), it must be the right size, comfortable and fit for purpose. It must also be free to employees.</p>

<h2>Managing workflow</h2>
<p>Make sure work is organised to avoid rushing or overcrowding. Keep employees informed about and involved in decisions that affect them, such as changes in cleaning methods. </p>
