<p>Roger Bourne (email: <a href="mailto:roger.bourne@bis.gsi.gov.uk">roger.bourne@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a>, telephone: 020 7215 1128) </p>

<h3 id="aviation-technology">Aviation technology</h3>
<p>BIS supports the aerospace and defence sector on a wide range of technology activity.</p>

<p>BIS ensures the international regulations and standards that are developed to minimise the impact of civil aviation are adequate, fair, contribute to the aviation industry’s sustainability and are not in conflict with the legitimate interests of UK aerospace industries.</p>

<p>This requires policy development, co-ordination of research activities, environmental model development, project environmental assessment and environmental forecasts and scenarios. Close co-operation takes place with the Department for Transport, which takes technical advice from us. We co-operate with the International Civil Aviation Organization, European Civil Aviation Conference expert panel on the Abatement of Nuisances Caused by Air Transport (ECAC/ANCAT), United Nations Economic Commission For Europe (UNECE), and the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

<h3 id="aerospace-msc-bursary-scheme">Aerospace MSc Bursary Scheme</h3>
<p>On 9 July 2012 at the Farnborough Airshow, the Prime Minister announced funding for 500 Masters-level degree places in aerospace engineering over the next three years – from 2013 to 2014 onwards. The places will be jointly funded with industry, with government committing £3 million, and will help provide industry with the next generation of skilled engineers they need. The programme will be overseen by the Royal Academy of Engineering and Royal Aeronautical Society. </p>

<p>Further information on the bursary scheme will be available soon on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.raeng.org.uk">Royal Academy of Engineering</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://aerosociety.com">Royal Aeronautical Society</a> websites.</p>

<h3 id="aerospace-business-leaders-and-aerospace-growth-partnership-groups">Aerospace Business Leaders and Aerospace Growth Partnership Groups</h3>
<p>The Aerospace Business Leaders Group is the senior engagement forum to discuss issues of strategic importance affecting the sector. The Group is chaired by the Secretary of State for BIS and also attended by the Minister for Business and Enterprise and senior BIS officials. Industry is represented by a small group of the UK’s top aerospace business leaders. Having identified key strategic issues, such as barriers to growth and key competitiveness drivers, action will be taken forward through an Aerospace Growth Partnership group, chaired by the Minister for Business and Enterprise, with wider business representation across the supply chain. </p>

<h3 id="repayable-launch-investment">Repayable launch investment</h3>
<p>Repayable launch investment is a risk-sharing government investment in the design and development of civil aerospace projects in the UK. The investment is repayable at a real rate of return, usually via levies on sales of the product. Repayable launch investment is permitted for the civil aerospace under the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which charges the Secretary of State with ‘organising, carrying out and encouraging measures for the designing, development and production of civil aircraft.’</p>

<p>Over the last 25 years the Government has invested £1.7 billion in repayable launch investment projects and during that period £2.7 billion has been received in income.</p>

<h3 id="low-carbon-construction">Low carbon construction</h3>
<p>An innovation and growth team was establised in 2009 to review the construction industry to ensure it was ‘fit for purpose’ for delivering a low carbon future. </p>

<p>The review looked at the strengths of and opportunities for the UK construction industry in a low carbon economy and considered how the UK can be a world leader in this sector. This review was led by Paul Morrell, the Chief Construction Adviser, and was undertaken by a mix of industry experts and those with wider business experience.</p>

<p>In December 2010 BIS launched its ‘Growth Review Framework for Advanced Manufacturing’. The Framework document was an invitation to provide comments and evidence to help identify the challenges and barriers to manufacturing growth, to feed into the Growth Review process. The document set out the Government’s ambitions for manufacturing, developed through consultation with industry. It was supported by in-depth economic analysis and a statistical annex in order to provide a substantial evidence base.</p>

<h3 id="bis-retail-strategy">BIS Retail Strategy</h3>
<p>BIS has developed a range of sector specific objectives which will be taken forward over the course of 2012 to 2013. These objectives have been developed to facilitate growth of the sector at a local, national, European and international level.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/b/12-1197-bis-retail-strategy.pdf">BIS Retail Strategy</a>  was developed with input from the British Retail Consortium, the Association of Convenience Stores and Gloucestershire First (the first Local Enterprise Partnership Retail Pathfinder)</p>

<h3 id="retail-policy-forum">Retail Policy Forum</h3>
<p>The Retail Policy Forum (RPF - chaired by BIS’s Retail Unit) enables a representative cross-section of retailers, and their representative bodies, to talk to Government Departments and EU officials about regulations and other key policies affecting the sector at an early stage in the process. It aims to help both retailers and policy makers by minimising the burdens on retail, looking for alternatives to regulations (where appropriate) and making any regulations and enforcement as practical and sensible as possible. The RPF meets three times a year. When necessary, additional meetings are held to take an in-depth look at particular subjects.</p>

<p>The Retail Unit also manages a Virtual RPF of UK retailers, trade associations and others with a professional interest in retailing. Communications are mainly by email and members can join the RPF’s working groups. To apply for membership of the Virtual RPF please email the Retail Unit explaining your interest in the sector and supplying contact details, including job title, telephone number and postal address.</p>

<p>The guide is a simple to use health check to alert retailers and others to early signs of potential decline in their High Street – and to do so in good time for them to take preventative action. It then offers some useful first steps, including advice on working together with others to rejuvenate the area.</p>

<h3 id="the-portas-review">The Portas review</h3>
<p>In May 2011 the Prime Minister announced that he had asked Mary Portas, leading retail marketing consultant, to undertake a review of the English high street. The report was published in December 2011: <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/p/11-1434-portas-review-future-of-high-streets.pdf">The Portas review: an independent review into the future of our high streets</a></p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/2120019.pdf">government’s formal response to the recommendations made by Mary Portas</a> in her report was published by the Department for Communities and Local Government in March 2012.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-high-street-performance">Understanding high street performance</h3>
<p>BIS has also published a report <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-1402-understanding-high-street-performance.pdf">Understanding high street performance</a>, which explores the many factors impacting on the economic and social performance of town centres and High Streets. This study is intended to help inform government and local authority decision-making regarding town centres, high streets and local economic growth. It has also provided input to the Mary Portas review.  The executive summary is available separately: <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/business-sectors/docs/u/11-1433-understanding-high-street-performance-summary.pdf">Understanding high street performance: executive summary</a></p>

<p>BIS works with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.taforum.org/">Trade Association Forum</a> to develop and communicate best practice among trade associations. The Forum carries out benchmarking studies and other research projects. It disseminates the results of these, and broader best practice, through its seminars, workshops and other events, and via its website.</p>
