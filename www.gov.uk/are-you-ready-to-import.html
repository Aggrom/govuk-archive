<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Suppliers around the world offer a wide variety of goods that might suit your business. You might be able to find lower-priced supplies, giving you a competitive edge, or new supplies that allow you to sell a completely different product. Just as when you buy within the UK, it’s important to find good suppliers, make sure they offer what you want and negotiate the right deal. </p>

<p>But importing also presents complications, such as managing long-distance relationships and organising international transport and customs clearance. It’s important to be sure that you are ready to import before you commit yourself.</p>

<h2 id="plan-your-import-objectives">Plan your import objectives</h2>

<p>Before you start importing, it’s a good idea to be clear about what you are trying to achieve. You might want to find a cheaper source of supplies overseas, or to import products that aren’t yet available in the UK to sell to your customers.</p>

<p>At the same time, importing should fit in with your overall business strategy. For example, importing low cost goods might be part of a cost-control strategy, but you want to be sure that this does not compromise your reputation for quality.</p>

<p>It’s worth thinking about how much time, money and effort you want to devote to setting up and managing your importing activities. You are unlikely to want to invest heavily for a small, one-off import. But if importing is going to be an important part of your business, you might be prepared to spend more on finding the best suppliers, building relationships and so on.</p>

<p>You also need to decide how much involvement you want to have in the import process. Importing can be fairly straightforward if you only deal with experienced suppliers who handle most of the paperwork and logistics, and get help from an import agent. On the other hand, dealing with less experienced suppliers and handling more of the process yourself could be more time consuming but also more profitable.</p>

<p>Whichever approach you choose, you should ensure that all the key people in your business agree and are committed to it.  </p>

<h2 id="understand-what-importing-involves">Understand what importing involves</h2>

<p>Importing goods from overseas suppliers involves all the same issues as purchasing from suppliers in the UK. It’s up to you to establish what you require, and find the right supplier. Check the supplier is creditworthy and can meet your quality standards. You’ll want to check the supplier’s subcontractors as well.</p>

<p>You’ll need to negotiate deals and manage the relationship. All of this can become more complicated because of the distances involved and different languages, business cultures and legal environments. See our guide: manage overseas suppliers.</p>

<p>Check that any goods will suit your production processes and satisfy customer demands. There are also extra issues to consider, such as whether imported goods meet UK legal requirements or require an import licence. See our guides on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/getting-the-right-licences-for-international-trading">licences and enforcement for international trading</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-and-import-licences-for-controlled-goods-and-trading-with-certain-countries">do you need an export or import licence?</a></p>

<p>Resolving problems - such as incomplete deliveries - can be difficult, so it’s important to plan ahead. For example, you might decide to hold extra stocks so that you don’t run out even if a delivery is late or contains faulty goods. See our guide: <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/starting-to-import">manage the risks of importing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="logistics-and-payment">Logistics and payment</h3>

<p>There are also practical issues to consider. Depending on the contract you agree with your supplier, you might be responsible for clearing goods through UK customs. You might also need to arrange some of the transport and insurance, eg from a UK port to your premises. Draw up a clear agreement setting out each party’s responsibilities and who is at risk if goods are delayed, damaged or lost while being delivered. See our guides on <a href="http://www.bifa.org/content/home.aspx;%20http://www.fiata.com/;%20http://www.export.org.uk/">international transport and distribution</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/international-trade-paperwork-the-basics">international trade paperwork: the basics</a>.</p>

<p>Allow for of the extra costs involved, including transport, insurance and import duties and taxes. Whether you pay these directly, or through a mark-up added by your supplier, they can significantly increase the overall cost of imported goods. <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration/overview">Use our interactive tool to understand your tax obligations when importing and exporting</a>.</p>

<p>Payment issues can also be more complex, particularly if you are dealing in a foreign currency.</p>

<h2 id="assess-your-skills-and-resources-for-importing">Assess your skills and resources for importing</h2>

<p>Importing requires special skills and extra resources. Before you start importing, you should assess whether you have the right skills and resources and decide how to cope with any shortcomings.</p>

<p>You need to understand UK customs procedures and ensure you have the right paperwork when deliveries arrive in the UK. International trade often uses payment methods, such as letters of credit, that require an understanding of payment documentation. If you agree to pay in a foreign currency, you also need to be able to handle foreign exchange. You will probably need new administrative systems to track deliveries and payments and manage the paperwork. </p>

<p>If you do not have the skills in house, you may want to invest in training. Or you could use someone else - such as an import agent - to handle specialist areas. You may also need extra personnel to handle the additional workload.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you might decide to only deal with suppliers who handle most of the procedures. Many first time or small scale importers prefer to keep things simple.</p>

<h3 id="financial-resources">Financial resources</h3>

<p>As well as skills, you need to think about what resources you can devote to importing. Researching overseas markets and managing overseas suppliers can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly if you need to visit them. See our guide on how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.cips.org/en-GB/">manage overseas suppliers</a>.</p>

<p>If your finances are limited, you may prefer to deal with suppliers who offer credit. On the other hand, agreeing to pay promptly could help you negotiate a competitive price.</p>

<p>Make sure you have planned how you are going to use the imports, and have the skills and resources you need in place. For example, you might need production capacity for processing imported components, or a marketing plan and sales resources for selling imports on to your customers.</p>

<h2 id="decide-your-approach-to-importing">Decide your approach to importing</h2>

<p>It’s up to you to decide how involved in importing you want to be, and whether you can cope with the paperwork, logistics and payment issues. Dealing with inexperienced suppliers, and organising most of the logistics yourself can offer greater profit potential. But it also requires more investment, and tends to carry greater risks.</p>

<p>Businesses that are new to importing often prefer to keep things relatively simple and low risk:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s generally easiest to import from countries within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. It’s also relatively easy to import from developed countries such as the USA. Importing from developing countries can be more complicated.</li>
  <li>If you deal with experienced exporters, it’s usually possible to negotiate a contract where they take responsibility for delivering the goods to the UK - or even to your own premises. Of course, the supplier will want to build all these costs into the price they charge you.</li>
  <li>You can also negotiate contracts in pounds sterling, rather than the supplier’s currency. Again, the supplier will want to build extra costs into their price for this.</li>
  <li>Some suppliers, particularly in developing countries, require payment by letter of credit. This can cause problems, especially if you are inexperienced. </li>
  <li>You can use third parties to handle your responsibilities. For example, you can use an import agent to handle UK customs clearance, and a freight forwarder to handle onward delivery to your premises.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you build experience and confidence, you may want to increase the scale and complexity of your importing. You can choose which skills to develop. For example, if your supplier offers a substantial discount for dealing in their currency, you might want to arrange training in managing foreign exchange, open a foreign currency bank account and invest in accounting software that can handle transactions in other currencies.</p>

<h2 id="negotiate-the-right-import-deal">Negotiate the right import deal</h2>

<p>Understanding your own strengths and weaknesses, and what your supplier’s priorities are, helps you negotiate the best deal. For example, if you have a healthy cash position, you could offer to pay more promptly in return for a good price.</p>

<p>The best way to split responsibility for delivery and customs clearance depends on your skills and what third parties you use. It can be more cost-effective for you (or your agent) to handle UK customs clearance and onwards delivery to your premises. Before you finalise the contract, make sure you can handle everything involved.</p>

<p>Try to plan ahead, anticipating what could go wrong and working out how you could deal with it. Even if the supplier is responsible for something, or you use an agent, you could still have problems if things go wrong, eg if a delivery doesn’t arrive and you can’t supply your own customers. See our guide on how to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/starting-to-import">manage the risks of importing</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever you negotiate, it’s important to have a clear contract setting out exactly what payment and delivery terms you have agreed. Using internationally agreed Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) helps reduce the risk of delivery problems or misunderstandings. The contract should also cover what payment is required, when and in what currency, and what payment method will be used. See our guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/international-trade-paperwork-the-basics">international trade paperwork: the basics</a>. You may want to take advice from a lawyer with experience of international trade.</p>

<p>Imports tend to run most smoothly if you build a good relationship with your suppliers. See our guide on how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.cips.org/en-GB/">manage overseas suppliers</a>.  </p>

<h2 id="review-your-import-readiness">Review your import readiness</h2>
