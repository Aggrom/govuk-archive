<h2 id="cape-wrath-training-area">Cape Wrath Training Area</h2>

<p>Location details and access opportunities and restrictions for Cape Wrath Training Area, near Durness, Northwest Scotland. </p>

<h3 id="location-13">Location</h3>
<p>Cape Wrath Training Area is located at the far North West corner of the UK Mainland approximately 120 miles from Inverness.</p>

<h3 id="site-description-13">Site Description</h3>

<p>Cape Wrath Training Area provides opportunities for a wide variety of field fire and dry training exercises across 25,000 acres of severe and isolated upland moorland.</p>

<p>It is the only Range in Europe where Land, Sea and Air training activities can be conducted simultaneously and where the Royal Air Force can train using live 1000lb bombs.</p>

<p>The Range forms part of an area that is often referred to as “the last great wilderness”, due to its remoteness.</p>

<p>Cape Wrath Training Area is home to a wide range of wildlife, and various parts of the Training Area have been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), an EU Special Area of Conservation (SAC), as well as a Special Protection Area (SPA).</p>

<h3 id="access-opportunities-13">Access opportunities</h3>

<p>There are two main ways of taking access to Cape Wrath Training Area.</p>

<p>The main access to the range area is via the passenger ferry across the Kyle of Durness from Keoldale.  This ferry runs sporadically from May to September. The frequency of the service is dependant on the state of the tide and weather conditions. Two hours either side of low tide the service may stop altogether. The ferry may operate outside these months by prior arrangement.
On the Cape side of the Kyle a minibus service operates between the ferry landing point and the Cape Wrath lighthouse along the public road. This service is privately operated and excursions from the ferry to the lighthouse and back take approximately 2 ½ hours. The public road across the Cape runs for approximately 12 miles thus the majority of people accessing the lighthouse via the ferry make use of this service at least one way. 10 miles of the road are within the Cape Wrath Training Area.  The public road is closed during live firing periods. The ferry and minibus service are also curtailed during these periods.</p>

<p>The other main way to access Cape Wrath is to walk from Blairmore, in the south, via the Sandwood estate owned by John Muir Trust, to Cape Wrath Lighthouse. Much of this route is unmarked, over rough and open moorland, and is not recommended for inexperienced walkers. Walkers are also advised to check firing times before setting off on this route, as should firing be taking place then red flags and lamps will be displayed at the Range boundary and access will not be permitted. This route forms the final section of the Cape Wrath Trail, a long distance route from Fort William of just under 200 miles.</p>

<h3 id="further-information-2">Further Information</h3>

<p>Location details and access opportunities and restrictions for the Castlelaw/Dreghorn training area, south of Edinburgh. </p>

<h3 id="location-14">Location</h3>

<p>The Castlelaw/Dreghorn Training Area lies immediately south of Edinburgh and is part of the Pentland Hills Regional Park.</p>

<h3 id="site-description-14">Site Description</h3>

<p>Castlelaw rises steeply from the valley to the northern tops of the pentland hills at about 500m. The highpoints of the Training Area give stunning views across the city, the Firth of Forth and on a clear day the highlands beyond. The area is home to some rare habitats and wildlife including small numbers of black grouse.</p>

<p>Although military training is the primary land use, the estate is also used for agriculture, principally sheep grazing.</p>

<h3 id="access-opportunities-14">Access opportunities</h3>

<p>The Training Area lies within the Pentland Hills Regional Park and as such there are numerous tracks and undefined footpaths for walkers. The area is popular with locals and visitors to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Live firing is restricted to the Live Firing Range at Castlelaw. Red flags (daytime) and red lamps (night-time) are used when firing is taking place. The public are not allowed into the Danger Area. The Firing Range is clearly demarcated by a fence.</p>

<p>Horse riding is now allowed on specified routes across the training area. These routes have been agreed with the British Horse Society (Scotland) and the Pentland Hills Regional Park. The routes allow riders to explore this area whilst minimising any conflict between horses and troop activity.</p>

<p>Please remember that dry training (Blank firing, smoke and pyrotechnics) will still occur in the training area so riders must expect sudden movement and noises.

<p>Location details and access opportunities and restrictions for Kirkcudbright Training Centre on the northern coast of the Solway Firth in Dumfries and Galloway. </p>

<h3 id="location-15">Location</h3>

<p>Kirkcudbright Training Centre, on the northern coastline of the Solway Firth in Dumfries and Galloway occupies an exposed headland 5 km south of the town of Kirkcudbright.</p>

<h3 id="site-description-15">Site Description</h3>

<p>Kirkcudbright Training Centre provides opportunities for a wide variety of field fire and dry training exercises across 4,700 acres (1,900 hectares) of farmland.</p>

<p>The range has many rare plants including populations of Narrow-leaved Everlasting Pea and Cowslips. The only known county records of six plants including Yellow Horned Poppy, Yellow Vetch and Pyramidal Orchids are from the range. Most of the rare plants flourish on the untrodden coastline and cliff face.</p>

<h3 id="access-opportunities-15">Access opportunities</h3>

<p>There is a danger from unexploded ordnance lying close to the surface of the ground in some parts of the range, and as a result, access is only permitted on four defined and waymarked routes which are located on hard surfaced paths and roads through safe parts of the training area.  These routes can only be used when the training area is not active and red flags are not flying/lamps are not lit. Horse Riders are warned when using these routes that the area is used extensively, by both fast jets and helicopters, for low flying exercises. High visibility clothing should be worn by riders. Please see safety pages for more information.</p>

<p>The main linear Access path runs from West to East across the range area. It starts at Torrs Point, where the Dumfries &amp; Galloway waymarked public footpath from Kirkcudbright stops at the Range boundary gate. The path is then marked by Dumfries &amp; Galloway waymarker posts throughout its six and a half mile length to Abbey Burn Foot.  Horse riders are advised to transit from Abbey Burn Foot, at the East end of the footpath, where there is an equestrian entry gate and parking for horse boxes.</p>

<p>There are also three shorter, circular routes on the training area.</p>

<p>Townhead Loop: This circular walk starts near Balmae on the Western side of the training area and is approximately four and a half miles long.</p>

<p>Howwell Loop: This circular walk also starts near Balmae and is approximately three and a quarter miles long</p>

<p>Netherlaw Loop: This short circular walk takes in Netherlaw Glen at the Eastern side of the training area and is approximately 1 mile long

<h3 id="site-description-24">Site Description</h3>

<p>Thorney Island was first used by the Royal Air Force in 1935 and was a fighter station and base for Coastal Command during the Second World War. In 1984, it was taken over by the Army and it is now the home base for an Artillery Regiment.</p>

<p>However, to call Thorney Island an island is now rather an anachronism for it has been joined to the mainland for some 125 years after the reclamation of 72 hectares of tidal mudflats in 1870. The island area comprises a mixture of open grassland (displaying a colourful variety of meadow plants in season) and reed beds. This variety of habitat, in conjunction with the surrounding wetlands, makes Thorney Island one of the best MOD sites for ornithology, with species including brent geese, oystercatchers, lapwings, curlews, skylarks and shelduck. Pilsey Island, to the south of Thorney Island, is an RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) reserve.</p>

<p>Location details and access opportunities and restrictions for Antony training area &amp; Tregantle ranges in South East Cornwall. </p>

<h3 id="location-25">Location</h3>

<p>Antony Training Area is situated in South East Cornwall, to the west of Plymouth.</p>

<h3 id="site-description-25">Site Description</h3>

<p>Owned freehold by the MOD, the area stretches from the sandy beaches of Whitsand Bay in the south across 350 hectares of rolling pasture to the mud estuary of the River Lynher. The conservation interests of the coastal fringes are recognised by designation as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).</p>

<p>Antony Training Area is used by members of all three services (Army, Navy and RAF) and their cadet organisations and their use is administered by Headquarters Defence Training Estate South West.</p>

<p>Within the training area there are two forts, Tregantle and Scraesdon, both Scheduled Ancient Monuments which were built in the 1850’s as part of a ‘ring of fire’ to protect the naval port of Plymouth. Created out of dressed granite and limestone, Tregantle Fort stands high on the Cornish coastline.</p>

<p>It provides accommodation for visiting units who may be using the adjoining firing ranges, other parts of the training area, or may be exercising elsewhere in Cornwall or Devon. Scraesdon Fort is used for many types of military training and its labyrinth of rooms and passages are ideal for training soldiers to operate within a built environment.</p>

<h3 id="access-opportunities-25">Access Opportunities</h3>

<p>When the Ranges to the south of Tregantle Fort are not being used for live firing, the MOD owned beach is open for public use. Access is by the permissive path, which runs to the beach from the car park alongside the highway. For public safety reasons, the path is closed when the Ranges are in use and the red flags are flying (or red lamps lit at night).</p>

<p>The South West Coastal Path, a National Trail from Minehead in Somerset to South Haven Point in Poole, runs through the Training Area alongside the B3247 so that access is not interrupted by the use of the Firing Ranges.</p>

<p>Lying alongside the Lynher River, Wacker Quay is leased to the local council who have developed a public picnic site. Wacker Quay was once used to dock barges delivering stores to Scraesdon and Tregantle Forts. After being unloaded from the barge, the stores would have been transported by railway to the Forts.</p>

<h3 id="further-information-from-14">Further Information from…</h3>

<p>Live firing notices are issued to the local parish councils, Harbour Masters, Post Offices, coastguards, and published in two newspapers, The Cornish Times and The Western Morning News.

<h2 id="dartmoor">Dartmoor</h2>

<p>Location details and access opportunities and restrictions for Dartmoor, West Devon, south of Okehampton. </p>

<h3 id="location-26">Location</h3>

<p>West Devon, south of Okehampton.</p>

<h3 id="site-description-26">Site Description</h3>

<p>Dartmoor is an area where the wildness of remote moorland remains undiminished. The landscape is dotted with many dramatic granite tors and other geological features. The climate of Dartmoor is dominated by south westerly winds, which are cool and wet, with the high moorlands of the north west being more susceptible to severe climatic conditions.</p>

<p>There are many prime examples of archaeological features, which record the history of man’s use of the moor, spanning time from Bronze Age burial mounds through medieval field systems to tin working remains and military structures. Farming remains the principal land use. Commoners grazing sheep, cattle and ponies continue to contribute to Dartmoor’s outstanding landscape.
Military training has taken place on Dartmoor since the early 1800s. It was used intensively for tactical exercises with live ammunition by the allies during the Second World War. Today the MOD uses (by freehold, lease or licence) about 12,760 hectares of the National Park’s 94,400 hectares. The Dartmoor Training Area is used for light forces’ exercises, mostly for Royal Marines and other units based in the south west.</p>

<h3 id="access-opportunities-26">Access Opportunities</h3>

<p>Dartmoor offers endless opportunities. You can wander or ride freely across expanses of unenclosed moorland, often accessed by public rights of way through enclosed farmland. Please note that land over which MOD byelaws apply is excluded from the Countryside and Rights of Way Act. Consequently the Range Danger Areas are not depicted as public access land on Ordnance Survey maps.</p>

<p>The Dartmoor National Park Authority organises an extensive and varied programme of guided walks throughout the year. A large proportion of the guided walk starting points are accessible by public transport and walks are free if you show your valid local public transport travel ticket to the guide.</p>

<p>Parts of three Training Areas are used for live firing: Okehampton, Merrivale and Willsworthy. When this land is not in use for live firing, it is used for dry training with blank ammunition and although the noise of training may be heard, no restrictions are placed on the public roaming over the open moor. Firing times need to be checked and warning signals heeded when wishing to walk within these Ranges. To assist public access, the guaranteed non live firing periods are shown on the Dartmoor Training Area website in Related links.</p>

<p>http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/</p>

<h3 id="further-information-6">Further Information</h3>

<p>For your own safety please observe the safety information which is given on the Firing Notice page and is available in the Military and Dartmoor Information for Walkers and Riders booklet.
Military byelaws prohibit access to Range Danger Areas when live firing is programmed. They also prohibit digging and interference with military items.</p>

<p>Firing times are notified in the local press on the preceding Friday. Notices are displayed in neighbouring police stations, information centres, libraries and most public houses and camp sites. Information is also available on Freephone 0800 4584868, and on the website (see Related pages). Updated information is broadcast daily every morning on BBC Radio Devon.</p>

<p>Location details and access opportunities and restrictions for Penhale on the North Cornwall coast to the south of Newquay. </p>

<h3 id="location-28">Location</h3>

<p>On the North Cornwall coast to the south of Newquay. Between Holywell and Perranporth.</p>

<h3 id="site-description-28">Site Description</h3>

<p>Penhale Camp and Training Area stands on the rugged north Cornwall coast looking out over the Atlantic Ocean. It is used by members of all three services (Army, Navy and RAF) and their cadet organisations. The sand dune system is renowned for its beauty, with dunes amongst the highest in the country, and is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). There are two Scheduled Ancient Monuments - an Iron Age promontory fort on Penhale Point and Bronze Age barrows on Ligger Point.</p>

<h3 id="access-opportunities-28">Access Opportunities</h3>

<p>The South West Coast Path (SWCP) is a national trail from Minehead in Somerset to South Haven Point in Poole and follows the seaward edge of the Training Area. For more details please go to the South West coast path website, see “Related links”. From Holywell (with parking in the National Trust Car Park) the SWCP follows the sea cliffs around Penhale and Ligger Points.
http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/</p>

<p>In the spring/summer you will see a wealth of maritime flowers and it is an ideal place to spot nesting birds and seals. The remains of some of Cornwall’s mining heritage can also be seen and care should be taken around these features. At the northern end of Perran Beach, the designated Coast Path drops down from the cliffs and, in part, follows the high water mark some 3km to Perranporth.</p>

<p>To supplement the Coastal Path, the MOD has opened a permissive path which continues the route following the red and white range poles south above the beach to the MOD boundary. This provides the opportunity for a circular walk from Perranporth that takes in the beach, the dune ridge and the adjoining dune grassland around the Perran Sands Holiday Centre.</p>

<p>This walk can be extended to pass by the site of St Piran’s Oratory and the recently excavated St Piran’s Church which lie just south of the MOD boundary. For further information on St Piran, the patron saint of tin miners, see (Related links) on the right. Please pay attention to the signs around the training area and do not venture away from the way marked routes as the training activities carried out on the site are hazardous.</p>

<h2 id="manorbier-range">Manorbier Range</h2>

<p>Information about the Air Defence Range at Manorbier. </p>

<p>The Air Defence Range at Manorbier is the only range in mainland UK from where the High Velocity Missile, employed in the anti aircraft role, can be fired.  This weapon system is the latest in a design progression from the Blowpipe system, deployed during the Falkland campaign of 1982, through to the S15 Javelin, deployed during the first Gulf conflict 1990 – 91.  It is currently one of the most effective and technologically advanced air defence systems in the world.</p>

<p>The aim of each missile firing is to assess the effectiveness of the whole system and the ability of the missile operator to engage a hostile aircraft, simulated by an aerial target known as the Banshee.  Banshee, which looks like a very large model aircraft, is powered by a two cylinder petrol engine and carries sophisticated instrumentation.  Used in conjunction with ground monitoring equipment, these aircraft test the performance of the launcher and operator.  Banshee is launched out to sea and recovered by parachute at Manorbier Range. </p>

<p>In addition to High Velocity Missile firings, which constitute the core business of the range, Air Defence Range Manorbier also plays host to the Air Warfare Centre who conduct a variety of aircraft related trials.  Every effort is made to ensure that the inevitable low flying activity associated with these trials is kept to a minimum over the mainland.</p>

<p>During firing, surveillance radars and range safety craft ensure that no unauthorised ships or aircraft enter the range danger area.  This exclusion zone covers an area of 570 square kilometres to the south of the rangehead, out to 21 kilometres and up to a ceiling of 40,000 feet.</p>

<p>Sennybridge Training Area, requisitioned in 1939, is the 3rd largest military training area in the UK.  In 1940 the Training Area became the site of a Royal Artillery Practice Camp. Today it hosts sophisticated live firing and dry training facilities for light forces including light (105mm) artillery. The camp can accommodate up to 1760 soldiers.</p>

<p>Sennybridge Training Area lies in Mid Wales within the counties of Powys and Carmarthenshire.  Situated just outside the Brecon Beacon National Park to the north west of the county town of Brecon it covers an area of approximately 31,000 acres (12,000 ha) of MOD freehold land and 6,000 acres (2,500 ha) of land leased from Forest Enterprise.  It measures approximately 12 miles (19 km) SW to NE and 5 miles (8 km) SE to NW.</p>

<p>Sennybridge Training Area consists mainly of a flat upland plateau known locally as Mynydd Epynt.  From this plateau there are spectacular views across to the Black Mountains, the Brecon Beacons, the Cambrian Mountains and the Carmarthenshire Black Mountain.</p>

<p>The uplands of the Epynt Plateau lie between the Brecon Beacons to the South and the Cambrian Mountains to the North.  The area became famous as the breeding ground for Welsh Cobs – the very name Epynt originating from an ancient expression meaning “haunt of horse”.  </p>

<p>The geological features consist of Old Red Sandstone in the south and centre of the area, with a band of Silurian shale in the north. Much of the upland area is above 1,250 feet (380 m) with the highest points at the Summit (Grid SN 927434) and the Lookout (Grid SN 961464) at 1,533 feet (475 m) and 1,563 feet (478 m) respectively. Most of the stream valleys lie between 784 - 899 feet (240-275m).</p>
