  </header><p>If you think you’ve paid too much tax, how you claim a refund depends on your circumstances.</p>

<p>Sometimes HM Revenue &amp; Customs will send you a refund straight away. </p>

<p>But if you’ve overpaid tax and started a new job, they’ll usually ask your employer to pay it back to you. </p>

<p>If you’ve paid too much tax on a pension, your pension provider may pay back the tax to you.</p>

</article><article id="too-much-tax-taken-from-your-pay"><header><h1>Part 2: Too much tax taken from your pay</h1>
  </header><p>You can claim a tax refund if you’ve overpaid in the current tax year or any of the previous 4 tax years.</p>

<h2>How to claim</h2>

<p>Call or write to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) and explain why you think you’ve overpaid. </p>

<p>If you’ve overpaid tax because of your redundancy payment, call HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). They may be able to refund you before the end of the tax year.</p>

<h2>You weren’t made redundant</h2>

<p>You can’t get a tax refund straight away if you’re getting any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit, if you’ve been getting it for more than 28 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>Give the Jobcentre Plus parts 2 and 3 of your form P45. If you’ve overpaid tax, you may get a refund either:</p>

<ul>
<li>at the end of the tax year</li>
  <li>when you start a new job</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re out of work for less than 4 weeks, you’ll get a tax refund through your wages from your new job - you can’t claim one.</p>
