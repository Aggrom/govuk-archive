<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/17/contents">Petroleum Act 1998</a> vests all rights to the nation’s petroleum resources in the Crown, but the Government can grant licences that confer exclusive rights to “search and bore for and get” petroleum. Each of these confers such rights over a limited area and for a limited period.</p>

<p>Most licences follow a standard format but <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is flexible with this and will consider adapting new licences to suit special scenarios. The Secretary of State has discretion in the granting of licences, which is exercised to ensure maximum exploitation of national resource.</p>

<h3 id="deccs-expectations">
<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s expectations</h3>

<p>Licences can be held by a single company or by several working together, but in legal terms there is only ever a single licensee despite the number of companies it may represent. All companies on a licence share joint and several liability for operations conducted under it. Each licence takes the form of a deed, which binds the licensee to obey the licence conditions regardless of whether or not they are using the licence at any given moment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> expects companies to work their licences. In recent years, the amount of acreage left untouched, and those exclusive rights unexploited, has become a matter of concern. This led <a rel="external" href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/pilot">PILOT</a> (formerly the Oil &amp; Gas Industry Task Force) to instigate the Fallow Initiative, which incorporated a process to ensure UK Continental Shelf (<abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr>) licences are optimally worked to maximise economic recovery of oil and gas.</p>

<h3 id="geography">Geography</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s licensing system covers oil and gas within Great Britain, its territorial sea and on the <abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr>. The designated area of the <abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr> has been refined over the years by a series of designations under the Continental Shelf Act 1964 following the conclusion of boundary agreements with neighbouring states. This includes the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/1126/contents/made">Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 (No. 1126)</a>, which implements an agreement reached with the Faeroe Islands.</p>

<h4 id="northern-ireland">Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>Northern Ireland’s offshore waters are subject to the same licensing system as the rest of the <abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr>. It receives a biennial payment from overall royalty and rental payments calculated in proportion to its population. Northern Ireland issues its own licences to cover its onshore area independently of <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>.</p>

<h4 id="isle-of-man">Isle of Man</h4>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.gov.im/ded/">Department of Economic Development</a> issues licences for its own onshore area and territorial waters.</p>

</section><h3 id="rentals">Rentals</h3>

<p>Each licence carries an annual charge, called a rental. Rentals are due each year on the licence anniversary (except pre-20th Round Seaward Production Licences, which were only due in their initial year). Rentals are charged at an escalating rate on each square kilometre the licence covers at that date.</p>

<p>Rentals have two purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>to encourage licensees to surrender acreage they don’t want to exploit</li>
  <li>to focus licensees on acreage they decide to retail</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually the companies on a licence agree among themselves (e.g. joint operating agreements) how to apportion costs, including rentals. However, the licence simply provides that each company is jointly and severally liable to the Secretary of State for all liabilities and obligations arising thereunder, and that it is not for <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to determine how the rentals should be apportioned. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will therefore invoice a single company (known as the licence administrator and nominated by the licence group) for a single rental payment for each licence each year. It will not collect separate rental payments within a single licence.</p>

<h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>

<p>Seaward Production Licences, and Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences, are valid for a sequence of periods, called terms. These are designed to comprise the typical life cycle of a field: exploration, appraisal, production. Each licence will expire automatically at the end of each term, unless the licensee has sufficiently progressed to warrant a chance to move into the next term.</p>

<p>The initial term is usually an exploration period. For Seaward Production Licences this is usually set at four years, although it can be longer for ‘frontier’ licences. For Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences, the intial term is set at six years and carries a work programme of exploration activity that <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> and the licensee will have agreed as part of the application process. This licence will expire at the end of the initial term unless the licensee has completed the work programme. At this time the licensee must also relinquish a fixed amount of acreage (usually 50%). </p>

<p>The second term is intended for appraisal and development. It is four years for Seaward Production Licences and five for Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences. Both licences will expire at the end of the second term unless the Secretary of State has approved a development plan.</p>

<p>The third term is intended for production. It is 18 years for Seaward Production Licences and 20 for Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences. The Secretary of State has the discretion to extend the term if production is continuing, but <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> reserves the right to reconsider the provisions of the licence before doing so – especially the acreage and rentals.</p>

<p>The qualifying criteria to continue into the next term are minimal. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> sets no maximum rate of progress and would generally prefer to see a licensee progress through exploration and appraisal to production before the end of the initial term, if possible. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> would not shorten a licence’s overall life.</p>

<h3 id="relinquishmentssurrenders">Relinquishments/surrenders</h3>

<p>Licensees are entitled to ‘determine’ (i.e. surrender) a licence, or part of the acreage covered by it, at any time (unless the licence is still in its initial term and the work programme is incomplete). <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> positively encourages the surrender of acreage if the licensee does not intend to work it, and a minimum relinquishment of acreage at the end of the initial term is a condition of most licences.</p>

<p>Partial surrenders are subject to restrictions, depending on the complexity of the area relinquished. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> does not wish to create unlicensed areas so irregular in shape to be unattractive to other companies.</p>

<h3 id="multiblock-licences">Multiblock Licences</h3>

<p>Many licences cover more than one block. ‘Multiblock licences’ are offshore licences for which the blocks have widely divergent licence groups of companies. This is common for blocks that are scattered geographically.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> recognises the problems that can arise from this and has undertaken not to issue any more licences covering scattered areas. It has no objection, in principle, to splitting existing multiblock licences and will further discuss the issue but encourages consideration of the following two issues beforehand: </p>

<ul>
<li>while the case for splitting more complicated multiblock licences is greater, it will be more difficult for the partners to reconcile the commercial arrangements.</li>
  <li>in past discussions industry raised concerns about the robustness of the splitting process. As far as <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is aware, these are yet to be resolved. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="onshore-licences-and-landowners">Onshore licences and landowners</h3>

<p>The Secretary of State issues landward production licences (Petroleum Exploration and Development Licences) under powers granted by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/17/contents">Petroleum Act 1998</a>. They confer the right to search for, bore for and get hydrocarbons, but do not confer any exemption from other legal/regulatory requirements such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>any need to gain access rights from landowners</li>
  <li>health and safety regulations</li>
  <li>planning permission from relevant local authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, nothing in part I of the Act confers, or enables the Secretary of State to confer, any right to enter on or interfere with land (<a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/17/section/9">see section 9(2) of the Act</a>). However, it should also be noted that section 7(1) of the Act applies the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1966/4/contents">Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966</a> in England, Wales and Scotland for the purpose of enabling a licensee to acquire such ancillary rights as may be required for the exercise of the rights granted by the licence.</p>

  </div>
</section><p><abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> processes several types of transaction, most of which can be combined in a single case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Licence Assignments (where a user applies for the Secretary of State’s consent to transactions in which one or more parties enter a licence and/or one or more parties leave it);</li>
  <li>Interest allocations (where a user applies for the Secretary of State’s consent to transactions in which the parties to a licence apportion licence interests between themselves);</li>
  <li>Operator changes (where a user applies for the Secretary of State’s approval of the appointment of an operator);</li>
  <li>Licence administrator changes (where a user nominates the licence group’s point of contact for <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>).</li>
  <li>Licence relinquishments (the voluntary termination of a licence by the licensee);</li>
  <li>Surrenders of acreage (the voluntary relinquishment of part of a licensed area by the licensee while the licence continues over the remainder).</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> will help users compile their applications, and will check their input for obvious errors such as interest allocations that don’t add up to 100%, but for the most part leaves users free to assemble their applications as they see fit.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> approves a transaction, <abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> will mail the approval to the applicant and anyone else he has asked for it to be sent to. After execution of an approved transaction, users will be expected to submit a scanned copy of the implementing agreement; and <abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> will make this process easy. <abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> delivers a necessary level of security by restricting access to registered users with password access, but it is the licensees themselves who control the confidentiality of their own data by giving specific account-holders access to their casework and data. For example, a licensee might decide to allow only its own lawyers to access one of its cases, or to allocate one or more access roles to account-holders at a law firm – the choice rests with the applicant.</p>

<p>Access is granted by allocating particular ‘roles’ (e.g. editors, viewers and submitters). Authority is based ultimately on a signed nomination by an authorised signatory of an Access Manager, but thereafter certain registered users have the authority to nominate further users on a case-by-case basis, creating a case and the team to handle it. We expect most account-holders to be given access to one specific case at a time, but this is not a decision that either <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> or <abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> will impose on licensees.</p>

<p>The first step for a licensee is to choose somebody to act as its Access Manager, who can then allocate certain other top-level roles to particular users. To do so, the licensee needs to complete, sign and return the contact details form below.</p>

</section><p>As well as processing licence administration casework, <abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> can handle rectifications and restatements, and provides a simple and straightforward way for licensees to tell <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> about errors in records, and to upload supporting documentation.</p>

<p>As part of a general drive towards improvement of the quality of records, each application will be checked for consistency between its starting point and the records of the licence’s current position. The first time each licence is implicated in a <abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr> application, the user will have to confirm this consistency, or tell <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> about any discrepancies and upload supporting documentation so that we can consider, and if appropriate implement, a correction. We have made this process as simple as possible, but we do nevertheless strongly recommend licensees to check records well in advance of their next application so that any discrepancies can be sorted out in good time.</p>

<p>All these procedures are covered in the main guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: At <abbr title="Petroleum E-Licensing Assignments and Relinquishments System">PEARS</abbr>’ Go-Live Date (16 April 2012), it will be ready to handle transactions on all Seaward Production Licences. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is continuing to migrate landward licences into it, and plans to start handling landward transactions later in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="legislative-background">Legislative background</h2>

<h3 id="petroleum-act-1988">Petroleum Act 1988</h3>

<p>Part I of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/17/contents">Petroleum Act 1998</a> (and before it, the 1934 Act) vests all rights to petroleum in the Crown, including the rights to search for, bore for and get it. It also empowers the Secretary of State to grant licences to search for and bore for and get petroleum to such persons as they see fit.</p>

<p>Part III of the Act deals with submarine pipelines and Part IV with the <a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/explorationpro/decommissionin/decommissionin.aspx">abandonment of offshore installations</a>.</p>

<h3 id="model-clauses">Model Clauses</h3>

<p>As with any licensing system, many of the detailed regulatory provisions are laid down in conditions attached to the licences. The Petroleum Act is rather unusual in that it requires these conditions (model clauses) to be published first in secondary legislation. Up to the 19th Round, the model clauses were incorporated into licences by means of a single short paragraph, but from the 20th round onwards they have been set out in full in the licence itself, for the sake of clarity. It is the licensee’s responsibility to understand these conditions and ensure they are observed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/225/contents/made">model clauses in use for Seaward Production Licences</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/352/contents/made">model clauses in use for Landward Production Licences and for Seaward Exploration Licences</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Model clauses attached to existing licences are not affected by the issue of subsequent sets of model clauses, except through specifically retrospective measures.
There are other restrictions on activity besides those contained in the model clauses. All new Seaward Licences (Production and Exploration) contain additional restrictions, e.g. a requirement to appoint a Fisheries Liaison Officer – and there are other controls (see below) that have nothing to do with the Petroleum Act. </p>

<h3 id="hydrocarbons-licensing-directive-regulations-1995">Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive Regulations 1995</h3>

<p>In 1994 the EU laid down strict rules member states must follow when issuing petroleum licences that comprise the factors that may (and may not) be taken into account when deciding whether or not to issue a licence, and the minimum amount of public consultation required. </p>

<p>These rules are contained in the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive, which was implemented in the UK in 1995 by means of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/1434/contents/made">Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive Regulations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-licence">Types of licence</h2>

<h3 id="production-licences">Production Licences</h3>

<p><strong>*Information about Seaward Exploration Licences at bottom of page</strong></p>

<p>All modern production licences run for the following three successive periods (terms):</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial term – may continue into a second term if the agreed work programme has been completed and a minimum amount of acreage has been relinquished</li>
  <li>Second term – may continute into a third term if a development plan has been approved and all acreage outside the development has been relinquished</li>
  <li>Third term – runs for an extended period to allow production</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms are of different durations, in accordance with the licence type, and there is an escalating annual rental.</p>

<p>While each term is commonly associated with a particular phase of a field’s life cycle, the licence gives the same rights from beginning to end; so nothing in the licence can bar production during the initial term, for example, if the licensee were to move that fast.</p>

<p>All Seaward Production Licences have the prefix ‘P’ (e.g. P001) whereas Landward Production Licences have a range of prefixes.</p>

<h3 id="traditional-licence">Traditional Licence</h3>

<p>This is the familiar Seaward Production Licence that has been in use since offshore licensing began. Most licences issued since seaward licensing began have been Traditional Licences.</p>

<p>An applicant must prove technical/environmental competence and financial capacity before an offer of a Traditional Licence will be made.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial term – four years</li>
  <li>Second term – four years</li>
  <li>Third term –18 years</li>
  <li>Mandatory relinquishment at end of initial term – 50%</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="promote-licence">Promote Licence</h3>

<p>This is a variant of the Seaward Production Licence designed to allow small- and start-up companies a Production Licence first and to attract the necessary operating and financial capacity later. The difference is seen more in the application process than the licence itself, except in that the annual rental rate on a Promote Licence is reduced by 90% for two years. The licence requires financial, technical and environmental capacity to be in place, and a firm drilling (or agreed equivalent equally substantive activity) commitment to have been made by the end of the second year – or the licence will expire at that time.</p>

<p>Applicants do not need to prove technical/environmental competence or financial capacity before award of the licence but they must do so within two years of its start date if they are to keep the licence. They will otherwise not be permitted to operate until they have done so.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial term – four years</li>
  <li>Second term – four years</li>
  <li>Third term – 18 years</li>
  <li>Mandatory relinquishment at end of initial term – 50%</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="six-year-frontier-licence">Six-year Frontier Licence</h3>

<p>This is another variant of Seaward Production Licence. It has a six-year exploration phase and is designed to allow companies to evaluate large areas with greater materiality for a period, so they can look for a wider range of prospects.</p>

<p>An applicant must prove technical/environmental competence and financial capacity before offer of a Six-year frontier licence is made.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial term – six years</li>
  <li>Second term – six years</li>
  <li>Third term – 18 years</li>
  <li>Special mandatory relinquishment of 75% after three years with a mandatory relinquishment at the end of the initial term of 50% of the remainder (making seven eighths in total)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nine-year-frontier-licence">Nine-year Frontier Licence</h3>

<p>This is the most recent variant of Seaward Production Licence. It is designed for the particularly harsh West of Scotland environment, and is similar to the existing Frontier Licence but with an initial term of nine years.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will only consider work programmes of the Drill-or-Drop type with the decision to be made by the end of the sixth year and (if the licensee chooses to drill) drilling to be completed within the remaining three years of the initial term. Because geophysical data is especially sparse in this region, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> expects work programmes to include significant new seismic acquisition.</p>

<p>Applicants must prove technical/environmental competence and financial capacity before a licence offer will be made.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial term – nine years</li>
  <li>Second term – six years</li>
  <li>Third term – 18 years</li>
  <li>Special mandatory relinquishment of 75% after six years with a mandatory relinquishment at the end of the initial term of 50% of the remainder, making seven eighths in total</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="petroleum-exploration-and-development-licence-pedl">Petroleum Exploration and Development Licence (PEDL)</h3>

<p>This is the full name of the Landward Production Licence. It is similar to the Traditional Seaward Production Licence, although for historical and practical reasons there are many differences in detail.</p>

<p>Applicants must prove technical competence, awareness of environmental issues and financial capacity before offer of a PEDL will be made. </p>

<ul>
<li>Initial term – six years</li>
  <li>Second term – five years</li>
  <li>Third term – 20 years</li>
  <li>Mandatory relinquishment at end of initial term – 50%</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supplementary-seismic-survey-licences">Supplementary Seismic Survey Licences</h3>

<p>If the operator of a Landward Production Licence wants to shoot a seismic survey right up to the boundary of their licensed area, they will need to operate the survey equipment a little way outside of it. If that means working in unlicensed acreage, they can seek a <a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/licensing_guid/awarding_a_lic/awarding_a_lic.aspx">Supplementary Seismic Survey Licence (SSSL)</a>, which lasts for one year and covers a kilometre-wide strip adjacent to the existing Production Licence.</p>

<p>A SSSL will only be issued to the operator of a Production Licence – not to their partners. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> needs to be told the coordinates of the additional area and provided an A4 map of the area. Any new Production Licence subsequently issued over the same acreage will automatically terminate the SSSL. If there is only a partial overlap, the SSSL will cease to operate on that overlap.</p>

<h3 id="seaward-exploration-licences">Seaward Exploration Licences</h3>

<p>A company that does not need rights to drill or produce can apply for a <a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/licensing_guid/awarding_a_lic/awarding_a_lic.aspx">Seaward Exploration Licence</a>. This is cheaper than a Production Licence and covers all acreage outside those areas covered at any given moment by a Production Licence. It is particularly aimed at seismic contractors who wish to gather data to sell rather than exploit geological resources themselves.</p>

<p>The licence costs a flat rate of £2,000 per year and covers non-intrusive exploration whether carried out for the sake of hydrocarbon production, gas storage, Carbon Capture and Sequestration, or any combination of them.</p>

<p>If the holder of a Seaward Exploration Licence wants to explore acreage covered by a Petroleum Licence, they will need to gain permission from the holder of the Production Licence.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-methane">Dealing with methane</h3>

<h4 id="flaring-and-venting">Flaring and venting</h4>

<p>Under the Energy Act 1976, as amended by the Gas Act 1986, the Secretary of State’s consent is required for the disposal of natural gas (whether at source or elsewhere) by flaring or unignited release into the atmosphere. There are a number of exemptions, including flaring covered by one type of licence and gas supplied by a public gas supplier. </p>

<p>Contact Ivor Newman on 0300 068 6046 or email <a href="mailto:ivor.newman@decc.gsi.gov.uk">ivor.newman@decc.gsi.gov.uk</a> for further details.</p>

<h3 id="methane-drainage-licences-mdl">Methane drainage licences (MDL)</h3>

<p>Many coal mines vent methane to the atmosphere or else accumulate methane that must be dealt with by the mine owner. Either way, the methane can create a health and safety issue and, as a very powerful greenhouse gas, an environmental problem.</p>

<p>Capture of drained methane requires a licence under the Petroleum Act 1998, but safety is the Government’s first priority. To regularise methane drainage, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is generally prepared to issue a Methane Drainage Licence (MDL) for a nominal fee, which grants permission to get natural gas “in the course of operations for making and keeping safe mines whether or not disused”. It grants no exclusive rights and so can overlap geographically with one or more PEDLs. MDLs generally cover much smaller areas than PEDLs – each typically covers one mine, although the Coal Authority holds a licence that covers the whole country.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-a-licence">Applying for a licence</h2>

<h3 id="licensing-rounds">Licensing rounds</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> issues licences through competitive licensing rounds. It believes this method yields better quality bids than other methods. Unlike auctions, for instance, licensing rounds do not divert significant sums of money away from exploration work and they give a much better expectation that a licence will be awarded to the bid that promises to optimise exploitation of the UK’s petroleum resources.
Onshore and offshore licensing rounds generally take place every year.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-round-applications">Out-of-round applications</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is committed to a competitive licensing system in which licences are issued in regular Licensing Rounds, and consultation has also revealed the industry’s preference for this system because of its predictability. There may, however, be exceptional circumstances where it would be reasonable for a company not to have to wait for the next Licensing Round to get a licence, so <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> also has an “Out-of-Round Application” process. It can only be used if justified by exceptional circumstances, and should not be seen as a routine alternative to the Licensing Rounds system.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> can only accept licence applications in response to a formal Invitation to Apply, so any company seeking an out-of-round licence must first convince <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> of the case for an Out-of-Round invitation. If <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> agrees to issue an Out-of-Round Invitation, in most cases the process will comply with the <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=EN&amp;numdoc=31994L0022&amp;model=guichett">Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive</a>, as implemented by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/1434/contents/made">Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive Regulations</a> (which will entail publication of the Invitation in the European Journal with applications usually being taken at least 90 days later), and all other relevant provisions including the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive.</p>

<p>A case for an Out-of-Round process will generally have to show that waiting for the next Licensing Round would cause unnecessary delay to activities under an existing licence (and that going Out-of-Round would avoid that delay) or that broad competition is not feasible even in a Licensing Round. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has, for example, accepted a case to go Out-of-Round where an existing licensee demonstrated that his development plans required a new licence over adjoining acreage, and that even in a Licensing Round nobody else could reasonably have competed with him for it. Out-of-Round awards are not appropriate for pure exploration or where a company simply prefers not to wait for the next Round.</p>

<p>Companies who want <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to launch an Out-of-Round process should approach John Arnott at <a href="mailto:john.arnott@decc.gsi.gov.uk">john.arnott@decc.gsi.gov.uk</a> in the first instance. If <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> invites applications, applications should be made in the same way as during a Licensing Round and the same guidance will apply.</p>

</section><h2 id="licence-assignments-transfers">Licence assignments (transfers)</h2>

<p>A company that is party to a licence may wish to sell an interest to another. Such a transfer is referred to here as a licence assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Licence assignments are prohibited, except with the consent of the Secretary of State. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will consider any assignment made without prior consent as a very serious breach and grounds for immediate revocation of the licence under the terms of the model clauses attached to every licence.</strong></p>

<p>This restriction also applies to assignments between sister companies within a single company group, and to the withdrawal of a company from a licence that entails the assignment of rights to the remaining companies.</p>

<p>There is a type of allowed transaction in which two or more companies already on a licence adjust the proportions of their shares of the licence interests/liabilities – as long as no party enters or leaves the licence. These transactions can be made through the adjustment of a joint operating agreement (or similar agreement among the companies). They do not qualify as licence assignments. Visit the <a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/licensing_guid/joint_operatin/joint_operatin.aspx">Operating agreements</a> web page for more information.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-procedures">Overview of procedures</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> operates a simple email-based application procedure for licence assignments. If we receive a complete form, there won’t be a need for further information (although we do reserve the right to contact the applicant if we deem it necessary).</p>

<p>This approach sees a marked reduction in regulation compared with earlier systems, under which applicants had to submit pre-execution drafts of all relevant legal documentation. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has also suspended the need to supply executed copies of all documentation after completion, but it does still require notification of completion and has added a facility to make this easy. Each consent carries a notification slip to be completed and returned by the assignee(s) as soon as possible post-completion.</p>

<p>We expect applications to have been agreed by all other necessary parties, at least in principle, before applications are submitted – particularly other parties to the licence. There is a box on the S8 form that requires confirmation of this.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will routinely seek advice about applications from the Licensing and Consents Unit’s asset teams, Exploration Team, Decommissioning Unit, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> financial advisers and others. We also circulate details of each application to Inland Revenue’s Oil Taxation Office (OTO).</p>

<h3 id="policy">Policy</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> generally considers increased volumes of licence assignments as a positive indication of companies improving their alignment on each licence. This does not mean they are regarded as mere tradable assets, and we expect companies to buy licence interests with a view to exploiting them – not merely to sell them on.</p>

<p>The following issues can cause concern about any particular assignment:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>technical and financial capacity of the licensee</strong> – <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> must be satisfied the proposed new company is suitable for the licence, and that it has the capacity to participate fully in licence operations and discharge its licence obligations. See <a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/licensing_guid/suitability_of/suitability_of.aspx">Suitability of licensees</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>
<strong>decommissioning costs</strong> – financial capacity will be a greater concern if significant decommissioning costs are likely to be incurred by licensees. The dedicated decommissioning unit in Aberdeen is looking to ensure future decommissioning liabilities are covered.</li>
  <li>
<strong>new entrants to the UK</strong> – <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will always consider a company’s track record. If the company is new to the UK, we will try to take into account its overseas record. Where the proposed licensee is a subsidiary of a foreign parent, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will generally require an undertaking from the parent to support the licensee in its licence operations. See <a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/licensing_guid/suitability_of/suitability_of.aspx">Suitability of licensees</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>
<strong>effect on operatorship arrangements</strong> – <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not approve an assignment if it would leave the licence without an approved operator. When an operator seeks to leave a licence, they will need to ensure the remaining partners have agreed a replacement operator and that <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is ready to approve their choice. This is especially important for production operatorship. Approving an operator can take time, especially a production operator without a record of operating on the <abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>licence alignment</strong> – this is not usually a concern for <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> but we might need to look carefully at a case in which one company gains a completely dominant position on a licence, or where one company has such a small interest that it is not motivated to participate fully in exploiting the licence but yet can still block it. This is more likely to be a concern where a field or a prospect near to development is affected.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Intragroup assignments</strong> – <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has no objection in principle to assignments to a sister company but if they are made specifically to dispse of the licence interests via a corporate sale, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will generally want to know who the buyer is before it is approved. Where the reason for the assignment is tax-related, we recommend first discussing it with the Oil Taxation Office.</li>
  <li>
<strong>fragmentation of licence interests</strong> – in some circumstances the creation of very small licence interests may be of questionable advantage to the <abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr>. It may, for instance, prejudice the licence group’s attempts to agree on new work by introducing new voices. However, such drawbacks may be outweighed by a new licensee’s expertise or experience. As a general rule, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> suggests any licensee seeking to create small licence interests (under 5%) should justify the transaction in the ‘extra information’ section of the application form.</li>
  <li>
<strong>infrastructure</strong> – this is a conceivable rather than routine issue, but <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> might be concerned if, for instance, it seemed an infrastructure owner was seeking to enter a licence group to influence tariffing negotiations.</li>
  <li>
<strong>OPOL</strong> – <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> expects all operators to be members of the Offshore Pollution Liability Association and to register each off its separate operatorships. Prospective new operators, to be approved as part of a licence assignment, can satisfy <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> that they are members by including their OPOL numbers at the appropriate place on the form.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="procedure-for-application">Procedure for application</h3>

<p>The current holder of the licence must gain permission to transfer it and therefore must lodge the application to <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>, even though in many cases much of the information <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> needs will have to come from the acquiring company. The application form below asks for all of the information <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will require for most cases. Use of the form is not obligatory, but it is recommended. Consent will not be granted unless <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has all of the required information.  </p>

<p>You can apply for consent to any number of assignments on the same form.</p>

<p>The form must be fully completed and in accordance with the guidance note. Avoid excessive precision when specifying the size of a licence interest; <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> generally does not record such figures beyond two decimal places.</p>

We will simultaneously approve the amendment/novation of all related agreements except operating agreements, which are dealt with separately (see <a rel="external" href="http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/licences/licensing_guid/joint_operatin/joint_operatin.aspx">Open Approval Operating Agreements for details</a>). </p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> prefers to email its replies and will copy to other parties as requested if email addresses are provided. A hard copy can also be posted as requested (with the postal address) at box S17 of the application form. </p>

<p>The Secretary of State’s assignment consent(s) and operator approval(s) are valid for three months after the execution/handover date(s) specified in the application form. Completions delayed beyond three months will require an extension, which we will generally consider on receipt of a revised completion date and confirmation details in the original application are still valid.</p>

<p>Once consent has been granted, the assignee must notify <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> within two weeks of their intent to execute the assignment. A confirmation slip to return is included with every consent email.</p>

<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>

<p>Consent for the transfer is conditional on the Deed of Assignment substantially conforming to a draft approved by the Secretary of State. There are currently two such approved drafts. The first is contained in the PILOT Master Deed, which sets out agreed assignment procedures and forms agreed by PILOT. LOGIC offers <a rel="external" href="http://www.masterdeed.com/">guidance on using the PILOT Master Deed</a>, the procedures of which <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> recommends using. </p>

<p>The alternative is the Approved Model Deed of Assignment; </p>

It does not, however, include execution or attestation clauses, which should be added as required. For instance, you can disapply the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/31/contents">Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999</a> in relation to the deed, and/or provide for the execution of the deed in counterpart. You must also decide whether jurisdiction should lie with the English or Scottish courts (it is traditional to apply Scottish law to licences covering Scottish land and waters, and English law to others).</p>

<p>The Approved Model Deed of Assignment is applicable to all licence assignments, whether they are offshore or onshore.</p>

<p>Use of either of the approved drafts is not compulsory, but if you want to use a different draft you must submit a copy in advance because it will need to be considered by <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> lawyers. This will considerably increase its processing time.</p>

<h3 id="no-objection-in-principle">No objection in principle</h3>

<p>Licensees sometimes ask <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to confirm it has “no objection in principle” to a proposed transfer – particularly for an Earn-In agreement, in which the assignee’s expenditure necessarily comes before the assignment. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> may be able to issue this assurance if it receives enough of the information listed in order to consider the assignment. This is likely to be before all details are available, so <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> won’t be able to offer any binding undertaking or replace the formal consent described above.</p>

<p>If you require this assurance, please complete as much of the application form as possible and make it clear you are only seeking a “no objection in principle” response.</p>

<p>Application for this should be avoided where possible because it doubles the time required of <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> for each transfer. </p>

<h3 id="processing-time">Processing time</h3>

<p>This depends on such factors as complexity of the assignment, quality of information initially provided, number of other applications being processed, etc. We generaly aim to process a straightforward case in 10 working days (although this can not be guaranteed). Production operatorship and financial checks in particular can take longer than this; the overall processing time will increase to 25-30 days where (straightforward) financial checks are involved.</p>

<h3 id="pipelines">Pipelines</h3>

<p>If a proposed assignment would affect either the holder of a Pipeline Works Authorisation (PWA) or the operator, user or owner of any offshore pipeline, the holder of the PWA must seek a variation to the relevant Pipeline Works Authorisation (PWA). <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> strongly advises the variation be sought as soon as possible and at least 28 days before the proposed completion of the assignment, so as not to delay it. </p>

<h2 id="change-of-control-of-licensee">Change of control of licensee</h2>

<p>The Model Clauses do not impose any requirement for the Secretary of State’s approval of a change of control of a Licensee (e.g. at a corporate takeover), but they do specify it as grounds for revocation (if the Secretary of State has instructed the Licensee to make a further change of control and the Licensee has failed to do so in a certain time).</p>

<p>The existence of this power can result in a request for comfort that the Secretary of State will not exercise it. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is generally willing to consider such requests, but we will not be able to offer any cast-iron promises; any comfort we give will be based on the information available to us at the time, and limited accordingly.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s policy requirement in this regard is that the licensee can demonstrate that the Change of Control will not prejudice its ability to meet its licence commitments, liabilities and obligations.</p>

<h3 id="information-and-documentation-requirements">Information and documentation requirements</h3>

<p>Details of the change of control should be sent by email to <a href="mailto:approvals@decc.gsi.gov.uk">approvals@decc.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<ul>
<li>the new corporate parent’s name, country of incorporation and company registration number</li>
  <li>post-change of control pro-forma balance sheet for the licensee and a consolidated post-change of control pro-forma balance sheet for the new corporate parent</li>
  <li>a list from the new corporate parent of its prospective subsidiary’s <abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr> licence holdings and commitments (especially those arising from Work Programmes, from the Fallow Initiative or the Stewardship Process) and a statement that it will support the licensee in meeting these commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon review of the initial information, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> may seek further information including, but not limited to, evidence of adequate ongoing funding arrangements and assurances from the new corporate parent of continuing financial support for its subsidiary.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> requires further information to enable it assess the licensee’s post-acquisition financial position, it will send a formal request to the originator of the change of control notification asking for such information as it needs to.</p>

<h3 id="parent-company-guarantees">Parent company guarantees</h3>

<p>Where a licensee is dependent upon the financial support of its current corporate parent to enable it to meet its licence obligations and will become reliant upon the financial support of its new corporate parent, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will require a parent company guarantee from the new corporate parent to replace any existing parent company guarantee which may have been issued. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s forms of words for parent company guarantees may be found here.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> would also require a parent company guarantee from the new corporate parent if, prior to the acquisition, sufficient value had been transferred out of the licensee to render it unable to meet its licence obligations without the financial support of its new corporate parent.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> requires any new parent company guarantee to be issued on or immediately following the date on which the change of control becomes effective.

<h2 id="licence-extensions">Licence extensions</h2>

<p>As the oldest offshore licences expired in September 2010, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has incorporated a licence extension process to prevent the 100 producing fields they covered from having to close down. The policy for licence extensions applies only to Seaward Production Licences. Landward Production Licences are far more diverse and the case for extending them will continue to be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has already amended 1st and 2nd Round Licences1 and has communicated the policy on the extension of 3rd to 7th Round (inclusive) Licences.</p>

<h3 id="policy-1">Policy</h3>

<p>Production licences grant exclusive rights over a particular piece of acreage for a specified period. At the end of that period the acreage is returned to <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s competitive licensing system so the Secretary of State can decide who, if anybody, should have the next opportunity to exploit it. There are only a few circumstances where exceptions to this would be justified, of which well-managed producing fields are the most important.</p>

<h4 id="producing-fields">Producing fields</h4>

<p>Many North Sea fields are capable of much longer productive lifetimes than was foreseen in 1964, when the first Seaward Production Licences were designated 46-year lifespans. The Government issues production licences to accommodate production from oil and gas fields and if a field is well-managed and still producing when a licence expires, it makes sense to take steps to let the field carry on producing.</p>

<p>Cessation of production on a field is not necessarily the end of its life. In some cases the field will have been exploited by old and inefficient infrastructure, leaving many hydrocarbons in the ground – and even if the current licensee has no interest in redeveloping the field with new techniques and equipment, somebody else might. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not deem fields as being of no further interest once they cease production, but will instead release them for relicensing.</p>

<h3 id="duration-of-extensions">Duration of extensions</h3>

<p>A licence extension is justified only by continuing production, so it should continue for as long as production lasts and no longer. However, future field life cannot be predicted with confidence at the time of extension, so we cannot specify the duration of an extension as part of the extension process. It is also not acceptable to <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> that the licensee decides how long to keep a licence, and licensees would doubtless object to an approach that allows <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to terminate licences when it sees fit. This leaves only one possible approach: an agreed formula, written into the licence at the time of extension, that determines its duration.</p>

<p>There are various possibilities but none are without drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>decommissioning is often associated with the end of field life and could act as a trigger in some cases. There is no necessary connection however, so in some cases it would give unacceptable results, e.g. if a field acts as a transportation hub or is used for CCS after its own production stops, decommissioning might not happen for decades after the end of the field’s own productive life. Besides, the use of decommissioning to trigger licence expiry would disincentivise timely decommissioning, and that would run counter to one of <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s most important objectives.</li>
  <li>the ‘cessation of production’ (c.o.p.) procedure is a customary step at the end of a field’s life but it has no legal force and it is instigated entirely at the licensee’s discretion. If <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> were to rely on it to trigger the termination of a licence, the licensee would be able to retain a licence indefinitely by refraining from starting a c.o.p. discussion with <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>, regardless of whether or not production has actually ceased.</li>
  <li>zero production is associated with the end of field life, but it can happen at other times too, e.g. a field’s production can be temporarily ‘backed out’ of a pipeline, and major redevelopment work may also require a suspension of production. In both examples production would temporarily drop to zero, but the field’s life would not necessarily have to end. It may be reasonable to allow a licence to continue in such circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s approach is to define the end of field life as a set period with no production, but not enforcing licence termination at that end point. Instead, from that moment onwards unless and until production restarts, the Secretary of State is empowered to terminate2 the producing area. It is a matter at the Secretary of State’s discretion and <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will consider requests to let the licence continue on the grounds production will recommence within a reasonable period.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> acknowledges this solution is not perfect but is confident it will continue to work satisfactorily in practice.</p>

<p>For 1st-Round licences, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> originally agreed a two-year period with no production as the cut off for termination, but now considers this too long. In a case where a field has genuinely stopped production, the Secretary of State should not have to wait up to two years to terminate the field; and in cases of temporary suspension a shortened period is immaterial.For 2nd-Round and those thereafter, a one-year period of no production is considered the cut-off for termination. </p>

<h4 id="poorly-stewarded-fields">Poorly-stewarded fields</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> requires the highest standards of operator competence and environmental protection, and will take action immediately if an operator falls short. There are also minimum standards for stewardship of the UK’s oil and gas fields, in terms of their exploitation, because <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s policy is to maximise economic production. There is an expectation licensees will use their exclusive rights to a standard consistent with that policy. Most UK fields are already well-stewarded but <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> operates a Stewardship Programme to ensure there are no exceptions.</p>

<p>We will press an existing licensee to improve their stewardship of fields not being operated to <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s satisfaction. If the standard continues to drop the Secretary of State reserves the right to refuse an extension to the licence at the end of its lifespan and instead invite competitive bids for a new licence over the field. The existing licensee would not be barred from entering the competition, and their knowledge, experience and track record would all be taken into account.</p>

<h3 id="prospective-areas-and-short-term-extensions">Prospective areas and short-term extensions</h3>

<p>There may be cases where a discovery is so close to becoming a producing field when the licence expires that <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will already have issued a production consent over it. In such a case it would generally be reasonable for <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to grant a short extension to allow the discovery to start production. If the discovery did turn into a producing field during that extension, from then on it would be treated the same way as any other producing field.</p>

<p>In 2009 industry argued that some discoveries (and even prospects) had not even reached the production consent stage but were nevertheless being actively (if belatedly) brought to development. It argued these licences should be considered for extensions to allow production. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> agreed to consider such cases, but only where there was already an ongoing work programme.</p>

<p>There may be cases where factors beyond the licensee’s control keep them from starting a development until near the end of the licence term. Such factors might include late technical advances and availability of infrastructure. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is prepared to consider short-term extensions in such cases but there is no presumption they will be agreed.</p>

<p>Short-term extension are typically for two to three years. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will generally terminate the acreage if it has not reached production in that time. Where the discovery is brought into production however, the licence will automatically be extended long enough to cover production – on the same terms as any other producing field.</p>

<p>Short-term extension may or may not also carry intermediate breakpoints. Their purpose is to ensure a licensee cannot sit around for the whole extension period without making progress towards production. Each such breakpoint specifies a minimum amount of progress that must have been made by that time, e.g. a well to be drilled within one year. Failing that, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> can terminate the acreage. This specified amount of progress is called a ‘related work element’. It functions as a deadline – not as a commitment by the licensee to do the work.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will usually grant a short-term extension where it has recently issued a production consent, but in any other circumstances a licensee who wants a short-term extension must make a strong case for it and should not assume <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will agree.</p>

<h3 id="trading-moratorium-and-active-partners-on-prospective-areas">Trading moratorium and active partners on prospective areas</h3>

<p>Short-term extensions can only be justified to allow a little more time to a licensee who is working to achieve production as early as possible – not to allow more time for licence trading. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> feels strongly that where short-term extensions are approved, it is necessary to implement a trading moratorium on the prospective areas to ensure the extra time is devoted to work and not trading.</p>

<p>There are two parts to this moratorium:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not consent to licence assignments over prospective areas</li>
  <li>the Open Permission (Operating Agreements) will be amended to withdraw the Secretary of State’s pre-approval of any internal reassignment of licence rights that affects a prospective area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The moratorium applies for the period of the short-term extension – from the licence’s original expiry date (17 September 2010 for 1st-Round Licences) until the area ceases to be a prospective area by first production or termination.</p>

<p>The moratorium does not apply to inter-affiliate transfers.</p>

<h3 id="active-partners">Active partners</h3>

<p>An ‘Active Partners’ procedure for 2nd-Round Licences applies in the period after a prospective area has been agreed by <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> but before the trading moratorim begins. This means that when a licensee asks <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to consider a short-term extension over a prospective area, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> requires one or more of the current partners to declare themselves as the Active Partner – the person who will the see the discover through to first production. This prevents licensees being able to sell up and get out before the moratorium begins.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not agree to a short-term extension if an Active Partner hasn’t been named</li>
  <li>once a short-term extension has begun, trading by an Active Partner beyond that previously agreed by <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> as its trading strategy will cancel the short-term extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Active Partner mechanism applies from the moment a prospective area is created until the short-term extension begins. Beyond that the trading moratorium will be in effect so no trading will be allowed, by Active Partners or anyone else.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not prevent trading during this period but will ensure a short-term extension does not begin if an Active Partner has either sold up or reduced their interest to a nominal level.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> accepts some limited trading during this period may not be unreasonable, where an Active Partner seeks to attract partners to their project, so any licensee that nominates themselves as an Active Partner but  intends to do any trading before the moratorium should ask <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to agree their trading strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not accept the nomination by one company of another as an Active Partner; each Active Partner must nominate themself.</p>

</section><h3 id="other-licensed-acreage">Other licensed acreage</h3>

<p>There is no case for an extension over acreage that is not in production – or well on the way to it – after 46 years under licence. The normal expiry process must be allowed to take its course over such acreage so it can be returned to <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s competitive licensing system, where it will rest with the Secretary of State to decide who, if anybody, should have the next opportunity to exploit it.</p>

<h3 id="multiblock-licences-1">Multiblock licences</h3>

<p>It has become routine for parties to a production licence to arrange and rearrange their commercial interests within the licensed area. This rearrangement often entails defining subareas within the licensed area, e.g. two companies might split their equity interest 50/50 in a subarea that corresponds to a producing field, while one of them takes 100% interest in a complementary subarea that corresponds to the remaining exploration acreage. The division into subareas has created two issues for licensees:</p>

<ul>
<li>joint-and-several nature of licence liabilities and obligations links companies on one subarea to the liabilities arising on another</li>
  <li>excessive fragmentation of a licensed area creates intercompany bureaucracy that puts a drag on further transactions. This is obviously a particular problem for the oldest licences, which have had the longest to accumulate this kind of fragmentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Industry (via <abbr title="Oil &amp; Gas UK">OGUK</abbr>) asked <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to consider ways to split licences among these subareas. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has no objection in principle and devised a method to split the licences, but there are two major constraints on any such split:</p>

<ul>
<li>it must be compliant with all legislative provisions, including the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive</li>
  <li>it must create no risk that any liabilities or obligations will revert to the taxpayer</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s approach is to let the old licence expire gracefully and replace it with two or more replacement licences, each covering a single producing or prospective area. It was not practical to attempt this for 1st-Round licences but we will try to achieve it for 2nd-Round licences.</p>

<p>The advantage of doing it this way is that it saves companies a lot of time and effort if extension and splitting – each of which requires a major licence-amendment exercise – can be done together.</p>

<p>Replacement licences will not be offered to anybody who wasn’t a party to the old licence and they won’t cover acreage not covered by the old licence. This process amounts only to the rearrangement of an existing licence into a more efficient form composed of several documents. It should not be seen as the award of a new licence.</p>

<p>In some cases it may not be possible to achieve one area per licence. If two areas are too close together to draw a line between them, or if they exist at different depths and overlap, both will have to go on the same licence.</p>

<p>There are some important points to note about this process:</p>

<ul>
<li>while <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is willing to consider requests to split licences, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is in no way committed to agree to any particular split.</li>
  <li>the process of splitting a licence is too cumbersome and time-consuming to ever be seen as routine, and <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> reserves the right to choose which cases should be accorded the highest priority.</li>
  <li>where a multiblock licence has been split into two or more licences, liabilities incurred before that moment will continue, inherited by licensees on all the replacement licences – but there will be no joint-and-several liability between those licences for future liabilities yet to arise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h3>

<p>An extension amounts to an amendment of the licence, so it must be implemented by deed. All parties to the licence must sign the deed, which must finally be sealed3 and signed on behalf of the Secretary of State. There is a standard form of deed <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> uses in all cases (but obviously case-specific information such as area definitions will vary from one case to another).</p>

<p>The standard deed for 2nd-Round Licences is different to that used for 1st-Round Licences – to accommodate the additional task of splitting licences – but the terms governing producing and prospective areas are essentially the same.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will draft each deed and make it available to the companies for signature. Once it is signed by all parties, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will execute it on behalf of the Secretary of State and return the main copy to the licence administrator. A duplicate copy will be retained by <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>. Creating and circulating certified copies of the deed is a matter for licensees to consider.</p>

<h3 id="timing"> Timing</h3>

<p>A licence must be extended (i.e. the deed must be executed by all parties) before it expires. The licence’s original expiry date is therefore the final deadline for completion of an extension process. If the deed has not been executed in time, the licence will expire and any producing fields must be shut down until a new licence has been issued (and the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive requires a full competition before any such licence would be issued).</p>

<p><abbr title="Oil &amp; Gas UK">OGUK</abbr> has expressed its concern that some parties might seek to extract commercial advantage from their partners by threatening not to sign a deed. To prevent this from happening, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has agreed to seek execution of each Deed of Variation at least nine months before a licence’s expiry date, allowing time for <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> to deal with a potential situation by offering a replacement licence after a competitive process if absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3 id="details-of-the-deed">Details of the deed</h3>

<ul>
<li>at the moment of execution, the deed defines the producing and prospective areas.</li>
  <li>between execution of the deed and the original licence expiry date, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will enable the extension by written notice to the licensee. In most cases, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will issue the notice with the executed deed.</li>
  <li>1st-Round licences – at the licence’s original expiry date, all parts of the licensed area other than producing and prospective areas are removed from the licence. The remaining areas continue.</li>
  <li>2nd-Round and remaining licences – the licence expires on schedule and is replaced by one or more replacement licences, each covering one producing or prospective area. The remaining acreage becomes available for relicensing.</li>
  <li>thereafter, each producing area continues while production lasts, and each prospective area continues for the duration of its own short-term extension and converts itself into a producing area if it reaches first production during that time. The Secretary of State is empowered to terminate a prospective area if it has not been brought to production by the end of its short-term extension,or if there is an intermediate deadline and the related work element is not completed by then. The Secretary of State is also empowered to terminate a producing area after any two-year period of zero production.</li>
  <li>once all of a licence’s producing and prospective areas have been terminated, the licence itself terminates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d-provisions">3D provisions</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> (and its predecessors) have always operated a 2D licensing system, in which each licence explicitly specifies a licensed area at the surface and implicitly also covers a volume of rock below that area down to the centre of the Earth.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> should switch to 3D licensing, in which licences cover volumes of rock rather than areas of seabed, and different licensed volumes can overlap. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has not ruled out the idea of switching to 3D licensing – in which licences cover volumes of rock that than areas of seabed, and different licensed volumes can overlap – but it is currently not under consideration. It would raise particular issues, particularly regarding access to deep rocks for one licensee via shallow rocks licensed to somebody else.</p>

<p>Many of the claimed advantages of 3D licensing are already available to licensees, e.g licensees routinely divide their commercial interests within a licence group using 3D as well as 2D definitions, agreeing the terms of the division between themselves and specifying the terms of their cooperation in pragmatic case-by-case terms not available to <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> when defining the basic terms of its licences.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, and given the extensions process will eventually require the amendment of all licences anyway, it has eemed sensible to make such minor changes now as might be necessary to enable 3D licensing in the future. If <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> were to switch, there would only be a need to clarify the Secretary of State’s powers relating to field developments.</p>

<h3 id="future-cases">Future cases</h3>

<p>After 2nd-Round Licences, the next licence expiries are not set to happen until 2014. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> reserves the right to review any policy at any time, but since 1990 all cases for extensions over well-stewarded producing fields have been formally accepted. This policy is not currently under review.</p>

<p>Given the element of uncertainty in on-field process and application procedure timings, it is never too early to approach <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> about an extension. Phone Jen Brzozowska on 0300 068 6030 for more information.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> recognises that a licensee may start work on a licence fully intending to achieve first production in time, but then find externally-imposed delays prevent them from doing so. This might constitute reasonable grounds for a short-term extension, but <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not consider the case unless it is clear a short-term extension is actually needed – and not just as a routine precaution. The formal process for the extension would then only begin in the last year before licence expiry. We also recognise there are circumstances under which a licensee will want to be ensured of their chances of being granted a short-term extension at a later date. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will consider these cases but is not obliged to grant the licence extension. </p>

<p>Applicants should set out a clear and reasonable timetable of work, with well-defined milestones, that would facilitate a first production before the licence expiry date. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> may be able to provide a certain level of comfort about a short extension in the event of an unavoidable delay, but this will be conditional on the licensee maintaining at least a specified adherence to the timetable. The possibility of this assurance is not to be treated as an alternative to licensees making the best possible progress with their licence, or a means to keeping acreage out of <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s competition procedures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has clarified this policy to licensees holding licences issued in the 3rd to 7th Round (verbally, at the fallow reviews held September 2011). Where it is clear that assets are not being worked in a timely manner, or are unlikely to attain FDP approval no later than six months before licence expiry, relinquishment will be requested.</p>

</section><h2 id="suitability-of-licensees">Suitability of licensees</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> works to maximise licensee exploitation of the nation’s petroleum resources. We believe we can best achieve this with a mix of companies – from multinational super-giants to small niche players. As production licences confer exclusive rights, we must be satisfied no licensee will block exploitation through a lack of technical or financial capacity. In addition, the Government has essential requirements, such as the establishment of a tax base.</p>

<h3 id="new-entrants">New entrants</h3>

<p>Companies new to the UK that wish to acquire or join a licence must meet certain criteria. They will need to provide details of financial capacity and information about the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>full name, number and address as on the Certificate of Incorporation</li>
  <li>place of incorporation and/pr principal place of business</li>
  <li>location from which activities related to the licence will be managed/controlled</li>

</section><h3 id="residence-requirements">Residence requirements</h3>

<p>There are different levels of residence requirement in accordance with what a company proposes to do in the UK.</p>

<p>To be a licensee, the company must have a place of business within the UK. This means it has one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a staffed presence in the UK</li>
  <li>a UK company registered at Companies House</li>
  <li>registration of a UK branch of a foreign company at Companies House</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement exists for any company applying for a new licence and/or seeking to join an existing licence by assignment. It applies to all licences and all companies, regardless of whether they will or will not be the operator. </p>

<p>To be a party to a licence that covers a producing field, a company must either:</p>

<ul>
<li>be registered at Companies House as a UK company</li>
  <li>carry on its business through a fixed place of business in the UK (this normally requires a staffed presence)</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement is for tax purposes. Refer to section 148 of the Finance Act 2003 [External link] or article 5 of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises [External link] for the definition of a ‘fixed place of business’.</p>

<p>There may be additional practical requirement to be an operator. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will generally consider proximity and ease of communications as factors in an operator’s ability to manage operations properly, e.g. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> may consider that a particular field in the Southern North Sea might be operated as satisfactorily from either side of the North Sea but not from the other end either of Britain or Europe. Such issues will be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<h3 id="technical-expertises">Technical expertises</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>’s main concern in this area relates to the operator. Non-operators don’t need to demonstrate as high a level of technical expertise, but we do expect the operating committee to be able to exercise responsible oversight.

<h3 id="partnerships">Partnerships</h3>

<p>Various types of partnership have been common in the UK for many years. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has no objection in principle to the appearance of partnerships on Petroleum Act Licences but before allowing a partnership of any sort to join a licence would want to be assured that:</p>

<ul>
<li>decommissioning costs would remain satisfactorily covered by the decommissioning provisions of part IV of the Petroleum Act 1998</li>
  <li>the Secretary of State would have control over the withdrawal of the general partner and/or from the UK within a 1907 partnership</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> would also want to be assured about the following concerns: </p>

<ul>
<li>1907 partnerships are not subject to the same controls as companies because they are less secure in the assets they purportedly hold</li>
  <li>the Secretary of State’s powers of revocation do not readily apply to a partnership where the idea of a change of control is less defined</li>
</ul>
<p>The Department would discuss with HMRC the tax position of any partnership. Visit the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC website</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) were introduced by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/12/contents">Limited Liability Partnership Act</a> in 2000.</p>

<ul>
<li>contact Keith Mayo at <a href="mailto:keith.mayo@decc.gsi.gov.uk">keith.mayo@decc.gsi.gov.uk</a> to discuss them in the context of decommissioning provision, or </li>
  <li>Mike Hawkins at <a href="mailto:mike.hawkins@decc.gsi.gov.uk">mike.hawkins@decc.gsi.gov.uk</a> for information about them in the context of adherence to a licence contact. </li>

<h2 id="equity-interests-and-operating-agreements">Equity interests and operating agreements</h2>

<p>Whenever there is more than one party to a Production Licence, the Model Clauses impose joint-and-several liability on them all. Nevertheless, for day-to-day purposes those parties will commonly enter into an agreement that apportions costs and revenues among themselves (for example, two companies agreeing a 50/50 split, often called an equity split). Such apportionment requires the Secretary of State’s consent under the model clauses. It is defined quite broadly (see, for example, Model Clause 41(5) in Sch 10 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/160/contents/made">Petroleum (Current Model Clauses) Order 1999</a>).</p>

<p>(Re-)apportionment will inevitably be a feature of many licence assignments (e.g. when a new entrant acquires a departing party’s 25% share), and <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will treat it as a routine part of any application for consent to an assignment. It may, however, happen by itself (e.g. when two licence parties make a new agreement that switches them from a 50/50 split to a 75/25 split). Either way, applications for consent to apportionment should be made through the UK Oil Portal</p>

<h3 id="joint-operating-agreements">Joint operating agreements</h3>

<p>Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) are not controlled in their own right. The creation, amendment or novation of a JOA may entail something that requires the Secretary of State’s consent – for example, it may (re)apportion licence rights or appoint an operator. If so, consent should be sought for the thing that requires it in whatever way is appropriate – via the Portal for a seaward apportionment of rights or an operator appointment, for example. If a JOA does nothing that needs consent, it needs no consent in its own right.</p>

<p>Operating agreements created as a result of the unitisation of a field across several different licences are usually called Unit Operating Agreements, but for the purposes of this page the same principles apply.</p>

<h3 id="open-permission-landward-licences-only">Open permission (landward licences only)</h3>

<p>Until <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> has migrated all its landward licences (PEDLs, EXLs, PLs, etc) into the UK Oil Portal, some apportionments of rights granted by landward licences continue to be covered by the [Open Permission (Operating Agreements [filetype:pdf filesize: 481.25Kb]. It grants prior approval to most instances of apportionments made under landward licences.</p>

<p>In this context, an Open Permission is a type of approval that the Secretary of State issues once, to cover a whole class of regulated acts. It is not issued to any particular person or company and so is open to be used by anyone at any time, provided that its terms are complied with. If a company is satisfied that the Open Permission encompasses the transaction that it wants to carry out, and provided it complies with any conditions or restrictions on its use, the company can make its transaction without further individual permission from <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>. A company cannot receive a copy of the Open Permission in its own name, and because it has already been issued nobody can apply for one.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the person proposing to use an Open Permission to be sure that it covers the transaction contemplated, and to ensure the satisfaction and compliance with the permission’s provisions. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will not provide legal advice. Note that one of the conditions of use is that certain information must be sent to <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> within two weeks of its use. This can be made by email to <a href="mailto:approvals@decc.gsi.gov.uk">approvals@decc.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Where an act is already permitted under the terms of an Open Permission, the Secretary of State will not further approve it with an additional individual approval. However, where an act is excluded from the Open Permission by its conditions or restrictions, the Secretary of State can grant individual approval in response to an individual application, but generally any company seeking it should expect to have to make a special case for exceptional treatment.</p>

<p>The Open Permission only covers the apportionment of licence-granted rights relating to petroleum won and saved, and any proceeds of its sale. Any particular agreement may be subject to other regulatory provisions (including other controls imposed by the model clauses). In these cases it remains the responsibility of the licensee to comply with the provisions. In particular, nothing in this approval affects controls on licence assignments, operator approvals or the Petroleum Act’s decommissioning provisions.</p>

<h2 id="charges-on-licences">Charges on licences</h2>

<p>It is common practice for banks lending money to companies to demand a charge on the company’s assets as a form of collateral. Creation of a charge on a Petroleum Act licence is controlled in accordance with the model clauses attached to each licence.</p>

<h3 id="the-open-permission-creation-of-security-rights-over-licenses">The open permission (creation of security rights over licenses)</h3>

<p>Any licensee wishing to create a charge should first consider the terms of the Open Permission (Creation of Security Rights over Licences) – particularly the conditions of use. </p>

</section><p>Where the Open Permission has already granted consent to the creation of the charge, the licensee can do so without seeking further individual approval from <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>. </p>

<p>As a condition of use, the Open Permission carries an obligation to notify <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> the following details of the charge within 10 days of its creation:</p>

<ul>
<li>size of the loan secured</li>
  <li>licences affected</li>
  <li>identity of the chargee</li>
</ul>
<p>Notification should be emailed to <a href="mailto:approvals@decc.gsi.gov.uk">approvals@decc.gsi.gov.uk</a> or to the <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> postal address. There is no form to complete or a prescribed format for the notification.</p>

<p>If a borrower defaults on the loan, the lender may wish to seek enforcement of the charge to have a licence interest transferred to itself (possibly after appointing a receiver). This would constitute a licence assignment, which is controlled in its own right under the model clauses. Faced with a request for consent to such an assignment, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> would take into account all relevant factors, including the expectations of the lender. However, the Secretary of State must exercise their discretion in each specific case, and this cannot be fettered by earlier promises to take, or not to take, a particular course of action. <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> will also not make such promises.</p>

<p>The Open Permission covers charges made to trustees on behalf of other financial institutions and crystallisation of a floating charge into a fixed charge.</p>

<h3 id="charges-under-scottish-law">Charges under Scottish Law</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is aware of forms of security where the assignment of the licence to a chargee occurs at the moment the security is created (rather than later, if and when the charge should be enforced). These forms appear to be particularly relevant where a charge is to be made under Scottish law. Before creating such a charge the licensee would require the Secretary of State’s consent to the immediate assignment of his licence to the chargee, but it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which the Secretary of State could make an informed decision at that time. </p>

<p>The Open Permission (Creation of Security Rights over Licences) was therefore reissued on 6 February 2012 to exclude from its scope the creation of security on such terms. However, such security is very unusual among licensees so this change is not expected to have any material impact on them. This guidance reflects current policy on such security, but <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is prepared to discuss other ways to address concerns, either on a basis of case-by-case approval or by further changes to the Open Permission.</p>

<h3 id="individual-approvals">Individual approvals</h3>

<p>Exclusion of a charge from the Open Permission should not necessarily be interpreted as a final refusal; it may be <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> is content to grant an individual approval after careful scrutiny. We will consider requests for individual approval on receipt of a written application (to approvals@decc.gsi.gov.uk or to the <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> postal address) that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the reason why the charge is excluded from the Open Permission</li>
  <li>information called for in the Open Permission’s notification requirement (in any particular case we reserve the right to call for other information as deemed necessary)</li>

<h2 id="streamlined-transfer-and-pre-emption-arrangements">Streamlined transfer and pre-emption arrangements</h2>

<h3 id="the-master-deed">The Master Deed</h3>

<p>The Master Deed was developed by the United Kingdom Offshore Operator Association (UKOOA) Progressing Partnership Working Group, <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr>, and other interested organisations. It aims to expedite the transfer of offshore licence interests and other agreements relating to associated assets and infrastructure, and it introduced a standard pre-emption regime to give confidence to incoming companies.</p>

<h3 id="transfer-arrangements">Transfer arrangements</h3>

<p>Under former practice a deal was often delayed by the requirement of signatures on many different documents – even when all parties were content with arrangements. The Master Deed allows licensees to appoint an administrator to act as their attorney for the execution of proforma documents. The administrator is a specially created subsidiary of UKOOA, titled <abbr title="United Kingdom Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr> Administrator Limited. The paid-for service is provided by LOGIC on behalf of the administrator, under a separate services agreement.</p>

<p>Use of the transfer arrangements is voluntary for the party disposing its interest. The arrangements do not affect existing rights of objection to an assignment or provisions for the granting or withholding of consents.</p>

<h3 id="pre-emption-arrangements">Pre-emption arrangements</h3>

<p>When informed of a proposed licence assignment, companies on a licence have an initial seven-day period in which to waive or reserve their rights to pre-emption. If they reserve their rights, they have 30 days to decide whether or not they want to pre-empt. </p>

<p>Following earlier concerns from new entrants about the risk of pre-emption on new deals, these arrangements were introduced to clarify and assure buyers – particularly those that have entered into extensive and/or expensive negotiations.</p>
