<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Metal production and processing businesses use significant quantities of resources such as raw materials and water. Metal production and processing includes manufacturing ferrous, non-ferrous and precious metals and alloys; metal forming; bar, wire and tube drawing; and metal casting.</p>

<p>Using resources efficiently in your metal production business will save you money and could reduce your impact on the environment. You can reduce costs, for example, by saving water or using sand more efficiently for casting processes. You may also be able to introduce new technologies to make your processes more efficient and reduce your environmental impact.</p>

<p>This guide describes your responsibilities if you produce packaging or dispose of packaging waste. It provides guidance on using water efficiently, how to avoid causing pollution from using sand and using and recovering scrap metals. It also includes guidance on business innovation and product development.</p>

<h2 id="innovation-and-product-development-in-metal-production">Innovation and product development in metal production</h2>

<p>Innovative technologies, products, processes or services may improve your business. Some green technologies may also benefit the environment and are supported by the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>However, before you use or develop innovative technologies or products of any type you need to consider their environmental impacts. The impacts of innovation can be unknown and you may need to take steps to comply with the law and protect the environment.</p>

<p>Business and technological innovation includes new:</p>

<ul>
<li>uses of waste</li>
  <li>waste recycling or reprocessing activities</li>
  <li>wastewater treatment methods</li>
  <li>approaches to cleaning up land contamination or water pollution</li>
  <li>environmental and clean technologies</li>
  <li>uses of chemistry and chemicals</li>
  <li>uses of biotechnology or nanotechnology</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are considering developing or using innovative products or processes, you should contact the Environment Agency as early as possible so that they can advise if there is anything you need to do, before you invest any money. You must make sure that you have all the appropriate permits and exemptions in place before you start developing your product or process and trialling activities.</p>

<h3 id="field-trials-and-testing">Field trials and testing</h3>

<p>If you plan to carry out field trials on your product or process you should contact your local Environment Agency office.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-and-clean-technology">Environmental and clean technology</h3>

<p>Environmental and clean technologies are products or services that reduce the risk of harming the environment, minimise pollution, minimise the amount of materials used or correct environmental damage.</p>

<p>You may be able to improve your products or services by using clean technologies. See the ‘Further information’ section for links to organisations who can give advice on sustainable innovation.</p>

<h3 id="waste-controls-on-your-activities">Waste controls on your activities</h3>

<p>If any of your business activities produce waste, including waste from research or trials, you need to comply with your duty of care. If your waste is classed as hazardous waste, extra requirements will apply. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/waste-and-hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-metal-producers--3">waste and hazardous substance responsibilities for metal producers.</a></p>

<p>If you store, treat or dispose of waste, even as part of research or trials, you may need a permit or exemption from the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>You must have the appropriate paperwork in place before you start your activities.</p>

<h3 id="storing-waste">Storing waste</h3>

<p>If you store samples of waste for testing or research, you may be able to register an exemption from environmental permitting. You can store up to 10 tonnes of waste samples at the site where they are to be tested. This is a U5 exemption. You must register this exemption with the Environment Agency.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/32322.aspx">Find waste exemption information on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h3 id="controlling-air-pollution-and-preventing-water-pollution">Controlling air pollution and preventing water pollution</h3>

<p>If your activities release emissions to air or the water environment, you may need a permit, authorisation or consent from the Environment Agency, your local authority or your water and sewerage company.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-obligations-for-metal-producers">Packaging obligations for metal producers</h2>

<p>If you produce, fill, supply or handle packaging the packaging regulations will affect you. If you place packaging on the market you are responsible for ensuring that it meets environmental standards. If you place large amounts of packaging on the market, you are also responsible for the cost of recovering and recycling a calculated amount of the packaging when it becomes waste, based on the amount you create.</p>

<p>Metal production and processing businesses may handle packaging waste such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>wooden pallets - from deliveries of raw materials</li>
  <li>drums - from solvents, chemicals or lubricants</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also use or produce packaging for products that leave your site.</p>

<h3 id="producing-and-supplying-packaging-and-packaged-products">Producing and supplying packaging and packaged products</h3>

<p>If your business produces packaged products, imports packaged goods into the UK or places packaging or packaged goods on the market, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>not exceed limits on concentrations of certain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and mercury in your packaging</li>
  <li>use the minimum packaging necessary</li>
  <li>produce packaging that can be reused, recovered or recycled</li>
  <li>keep records for four years as evidence that you are complying</li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements are enforced by the trading standards department of your local authority.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389514&amp;topicId=1086901227">packaging and packaging waste - your environmental responsibilities.</a></p>

<p>You must also comply with the duty of care for waste. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/waste-and-hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-metal-producers--3">waste and hazardous substance responsibilities for metal producers.</a></p>

<h3 id="your-obligations-for-packaging-waste">Your obligations for packaging waste</h3>

<p>If your business handles, manufactures, converts, packs, fills, supplies, leases, hires or imports over 50 tonnes of packaging or packaging materials in a year and has a turnover exceeding £2 million per year, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>register with the Environment Agency, either directly or through a compliance scheme</li>
  <li>pay for the recovery and recycling of a certain amount of packaging waste</li>
  <li>provide the Environment Agency with evidence that you have met your obligations - if you are a member of a compliance scheme they will do this on your behalf</li>
</ul>
<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389514&amp;topicId=1086901227">packaging and packaging waste - your environmental responsibilities.</a></p>

<p>To store any packaging waste before it is recycled you may need an exemption from environmental permitting.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-metal-production">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>Reuse pallets and packaging materials wherever possible.</p>

<p>Reuse or recycle packaging that you receive with deliveries. For example, you may be able to reuse drums or containers that have been used only for non-hazardous materials.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389514&amp;topicId=1086901227">packaging and packaging waste - your environmental responsibilities.</a></p>

<h2 id="water-use-responsibilities-for-metal-producers">Water use responsibilities for metal producers</h2>

<p>Your metals production and processing business may use water for cooling processes or damping down roadways and yards. Taking steps to reduce water use at your site can help you to cut costs.</p>

<h3 id="check-if-you-need-an-abstraction-or-impoundment-licence">Check if you need an abstraction or impoundment licence</h3>

<p>If you take (abstract) water from surface waters or groundwater you may need to get an abstraction licence from the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>If you store (impound) water, for example to create a reservoir, you will need an impoundment licence from the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-metal-production">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice-1">Good practice</h3>

<p>You could save up to 30% of your business’s water costs, and help to preserve water resources and protect the water environment, by taking simple low cost steps to cut your water use.</p>

<p>Reduce the amount of water you use. This could reduce your water supply and wastewater treatment costs, as well as your business’s environmental impact.</p>

<p>You have to pay for the water you use, and also for:</p>

<ul>
<li>disposal of your wastewater, either as a percentage of the amount of water you use or by the strength of your effluent</li>
  <li>losses due to leaks and wasteful appliances</li>
  <li>energy you use to heat or cool water</li>
  <li>staff time spent wasting water, for example excessive washing down</li>
  <li>pumping, storing and additional treatment costs</li>
  <li>materials or products lost in wastewater</li>
  <li>meter size charges</li>
</ul>
<p>Monitor your water use to help you use water more efficiently. Install water meters and read them regularly. This will help you to identify areas where you can save water, and will help you to spot leaks quickly. A sudden or unexplained increase in water use can indicate a leak.</p>

<p>Set challenging targets to reduce water use - for example by 10% in a year. This will help motivate you and your staff to make these savings.</p>

<h2 id="using-sand-in-metal-production">Using sand in metal production</h2>

<p>If you use sand for metal casting, you will create dust from handling and storing it. Sand that you have used for casting may also be contaminated with metal or with chemicals used to bind it for the cast.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-causing-air-and-noise-pollution">Avoid causing air and noise pollution</h3>

<p>You must ensure that using sand does not cause air pollution. You must also not cause noise pollution from deliveries or handling of sand on your site. See the guide on how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/prevent-pollution-from-metal-production-and-processing">prevent pollution from metal production.</a></p>

<h3 id="deal-with-hazardous-waste-safely">Deal with hazardous waste safely</h3>

<p>Sands you use to produce castings made from certain non-ferrous metals may have hazardous properties, due to them containing toxic material such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>aluminium</li>
  <li>lead</li>
  <li>cadmium</li>
  <li>copper</li>
  <li>arsenic</li>
  <li>sand treatment chemicals</li>
</ul>
<p>If the sand you use has hazardous properties, you may need to deal with it as hazardous waste. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/waste-and-hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-metal-producers--3">waste and hazardous substance responsibilities for metal producers.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice-2">Good practice</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>reclaim sand to save money and to reduce the amount of waste you produce</li>
  <li>practise good housekeeping techniques, such as keeping building doors closed to contain noise from sand reclamation operations</li>
  <li>regularly maintain your extraction system to ensure it works efficiently</li>
  <li>keep reclaimed sand in sealed storage areas or silos to prevent it causing air pollution</li>
  <li>cover sand when you transport it to reduce dust</li>
</ul>
<p>The construction industry may be able to recycle waste sand that you cannot reuse in the foundry. It can be used in the production of cement, asphalt and concrete blocks.</p>

<p>Ask your trade association for further information. <a rel="external" href="http://www.taforum.org/">Find information on trade associations on the Trade Association Forum website.</a></p>

<h2 id="using-scrap-metals-in-metal-production">Using scrap metals in metal production</h2>

<p>Your business may buy scrap metal to use in furnaces or recover scrap metal from metals production and processing activities.</p>

<h3 id="buying-scrap-metal">Buying scrap metal</h3>

<p>You should examine scrap material carefully to ensure that it is not contaminated. Unless you have registered an exemption with the Environment Agency to use contaminated scrap, you should only use scrap material that is free from:</p>

<ul>
<li>oil</li>
  <li>grease</li>
  <li>plastic</li>
  <li>paint</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="waste-scrap-metal-activities">Waste scrap metal activities</h3>

<p>If you treat, keep or dispose of waste scrap metal, you may need an environmental permit from the Environment Agency. Some waste activities are exempt from environmental permitting. If you carry out an exempt activity you need to register the activity with the Environment Agency. For example, you may need to register an exemption for recovering scrap metal.</p>

<p>If you transport scrap metal into or out of the UK, you must comply with regulations on the international shipment of waste. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/importing-and-exporting-waste">importing and exporting waste.</a></p>

<h3 id="handling-end-of-life-vehicles">Handling end-of-life vehicles</h3>

<p>If you handle waste vehicles you may have to comply with legal requirements. See the guidance on <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/regulation/31887.aspx">end-of-life vehicles.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice-3">Good practice</h3>

<p>Set up a scrap management system to help you identify and separate out contaminants, eg oil, plastic, rubber and radioactive materials.</p>

<p>Use non-chlorinated cutting fluids for all applications, especially where you might recycle the scrap material.</p>

<p>Store oil-contaminated scrap on concrete pads.</p>

<p>Install drainage systems that are isolated from general drainage and fit them with an oil interceptor or alternative water treatment system. Ensure that your oil interceptor is inspected and serviced regularly. You may need permission from the Environment Agency or your water and sewerage company to discharge the wastewater from your oil interceptor.</p>

<p>Check scrap metal for radioactivity using a fixed or hand-held monitor as soon as you receive it. If you receive old factory machinery, always ask whether it has ever used any radioactive sources.</p>

<p>Be suspicious of an object if it is very heavy for its size. It may contain lead but it could also be made of depleted uranium, which is used to shield radioactive sources.</p>

<p>Be wary of containers such as drums, heavy boxes and objects displaying the radiation warning symbol. If you find an item with the radiation warning symbol, or you detect radiation with a fixed or hand-held monitor, contact the Environment Agency Helpline on 03708 506 506.</p>
