  </header><p>As an employer, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations if you make lost-time payments to employees who attend third-party events.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>Events covered by lost-time payments include:</p>

<ul>
<li>trade union meetings</li>
  <li>meetings of public bodies</li>
  <li>jury service</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>If the lost-time payment only replaces an employee’s lost earnings, you don’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or pay tax and National Insurance.</p>

<h2>Jury service</h2>

<p>You don’t have to pay an employee if they’re on jury service, as they can claim loss of earnings from the court.</p>
