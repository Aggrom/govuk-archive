  </header><p>A horse is considered to be an agricultural animal if it is used to farm agricultural land or is farmed for meat or hides.</p>

<p>Horses on farms or in stables and livery yards are protected by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/contents" title="Animal Welfare Act">Animal Welfare Act.</a> If you own or are responsible for a horse, you have a duty to look after its basic welfare by:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing it with a suitable place to live</li>
  <li>giving it a suitable diet</li>
  <li>protecting it from pain, injury, suffering and disease</li>
  <li>making sure it can behave normally and naturally</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can be fined up to £20,000 or sent to prison for up to 6 months if you are cruel to an animal or don’t care for it properly. You may also be banned from owning animals in future.</p>
</div>

<p>The standards for looking after horses on farms or in livery yards are set out in the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) ‘Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses, Ponies, Donkeys and their Hybrids’. </p>
