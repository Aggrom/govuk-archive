<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Almost all governments control the export of goods for different reasons, depending on the nature and destinations of the proposed exports. The export of strategic goods and technologies are controlled for various reasons including:</p>

<ul>
<li>concerns about a country’s internal repression of its citizens, regional instability and other human rights violations</li>
  <li>concerns about the development of weapons of mass destruction</li>
  <li>foreign policy and international treaty commitments, such as the imposition of European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) or United Nations (<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>) trade sanctions or arms embargoes</li>
  <li>concerns for the national and collective security of the UK and its allies</li>
</ul>
<p>Trade restrictions (which include an arms embargo) are in force on Syria.</p>

<p>These are <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> imposed embargoes which are directly applicable in UK law.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> originally imposed sanctions which came into force on 10 May 2011. The current trade sanction measures in force are set out in Council Decision 2012/122/<abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">CFSP</abbr> which was adopted and came into force on 27 February 2012. On the same day, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> also issued an implementing measure, Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 168/2012, which amends Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 36/2012.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has also imposed a further implementing measure - Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 509/2012 - which came into force on 17 June 2012. This measure, which also amends Council Regulation <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (No 36/2012) imposes a prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export of listed luxury goods and certain dual-use items and chemicals.</p>

<p>In addition the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> have imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on specified Syrian officials.</p>

<p>This guide outlines relevant information about the trade restrictions and arms embargo on Syria only. It explains the extent of the trade restrictions and outlines the UK and international laws that enforce it. You can also find out how to apply for an export licence to Syria and the basis for assessment of each licence application.</p>

<p>For information on financial sanctions, please refer to the HM Treasury website. For restrictions on imports from Syria, please refer to Notices issued by the Import Licensing Branch (<abbr title="Import Licensing Branch">ILB</abbr>) part of the Department for Businss, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>).</p>

<p>There are extensive trade restrictions on Syria. These include an arms embargo, which is a ban on the export of ‘arms and related material’ (ie military ammunition, weapons and goods). This can be put in place by either the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, the Organisation on Security and Co-operation in Europe, or at a UK national level.</p>

<p>The UK interprets an arms embargo as covering all goods and items on the UK Military List (which forms part of the UK Strategic Control Lists), unless stated otherwise. For more information see the guide on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">UK Strategic Export Control Lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, some goods which are not on the UK Military List might also need an export licence. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes">Military end-use control guidance notes</a>.</p>

  <li>a prohibition on the sale, supply, transfer or export of listed luxury goods</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>a prohibition on Syrian banks from opening new branches, subsidiaries or representative offices in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and from establishing joint ventures or acquiring an interest in banks in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.

<p>As of 19 January 2012, a range of restrictive measure apply in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on exports to Syria’s oil and gas and electricity generating industries. The measures target both the industries within Syria and also Syrian enterprises engaged in those activities outside Syria. The measures could apply to your business if you trade with Syria, or intend to trade in goods or technology relating to:</p>

<ul>
<li>exploration of crude oil and natural gas</li>
  <li>production of crude oil and natural gas</li>
  <li>refining</li>
  <li>liquefaction of natural gas</li>
  <li>equipment or technology to be used in the construction or installation in Syria of new power plants for electricity production</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 36/2012 (as amended by Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 168/2012) specifically states the restrictions on oil and gas equipment in Articles 8 and 9, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export the key equipment or technology listed in Annex VI, directly or indirectly, to any Syrian person, entity or body, for use in Syria</li>
  <li>prohibited to provide, directly or indirectly, financing or financial assistance, technical assistance or brokering services related to equipment and technology listed in Annex VI, or related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance and use of goods listed in Annex VI, to any Syrian person, entity or body, or for use in Syria</li>
  <li>prohibited to participate, knowingly and intentionally, in any activity the object or effect of which is to circumvent the specified prohibitions</li>
</ul>
<p>The prohibitions relating to restrictions on infrastructure projects are specified in Article 12 of the Regulation. This specifically states that it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export equipment or technology to be used in the construction or installation in Syria of new power plants for electricity production, as listed in Annex VII</li>
  <li>prohibited to provide, directly or indirectly, financing or technical assistance in relation to any infrastructure project referred to above</li>
</ul>
<p>To gain a fuller undertanding, you are advised to <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:016:0001:0032:EN:PDF">download the full text of Regulation 36/2012 from the Europa website (PDF, 1.24MB)</a>.</p>

<p>If you are impacted by these restrictions, your first action is to refer to the items detailed in either Annex VI or Annex VII of this Regulation before you directly or indirectly sell, supply, transfer or export any listed item to any Syrian person, entity or body or for use in Syria.  </p>

<p>In most cases, you should be able to determine this by ‘self-rating’ your items. However, if you have tried this and cannot do so, you can seek advice by submitting a Control List Classification Advice service request via SPIRE. For more details see the guide <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">how to determine if your goods need an export licence</a>.</p>

<h3 id="contractual-exemption">Contractual Exemption</h3>

<p>There is an exemption for Annex VI and Annex VII listed goods for pre-existing contracts. The prohibitions do not apply if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>a contract, subcontract or agreement which obliges you to supply the equipment or to provide technical or financial assistance or brokering services related to the equipment</li>
  <li>that contract was concluded before 19 January 2012</li>
  <li>you have notified the relevant competent authority of the transaction at least 21 calendar days in advance. In the UK this authority is the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The completed form to claim the exemption should be emailed to <a href="mailto:eco.oil&amp;gasnotifications@bis.gsi.gov.uk">eco.oil&amp;gasnotifications@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If the items you intend to export are not listed on either Annex VI or Annex VII, there is no prohibition on their export under the provisions. However, you will need to check that your items are not controlled or prohibited under any other provision. You should also check that the entity you are supplying is not subject to asset freeze provisions.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-an-export-licence-to-syria">Applying for an export licence to Syria</h2>

<p>Exporters can apply for an export licence for their goods. All applications will be considered by the government on a case-by-case basis in relation to the terms of the embargo and in line with the provisions of the Consolidated <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. Read the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/assessment-of-export-licence-applications-criteria-and-policy">assessment of export licence applications - criteria and policy</a>.</p>

<p>However, many of the restrictions against Syria are prohibitions. That means that there is a complete ban on supply or trade with Syria in the listed items or activity. Licences will not normally be issued where there is a prohibition in place. While there are some limited exemptions to the prohibitions, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> would expect to issue an export licence only in exceptional circumstances in line with the relevant exemption and after careful assessment on a case-by-case basis against the Criteria.</p>

<p>There are exemptions for export for humanitarian use or for use of <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> personnel.</p>

<h3 id="eu-legislation">
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation</h3>

<p>In response to the violent repression by Syrian government forces, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> orignally imposed sanctions on Syria which came into force with immediate effect on 10 May 2011. The sanctions were originally detailed in Council Decision 2011/273/<abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">CFSP</abbr> (published in the Official Journal of the European Union L121, 10.4.2011, p11) and Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 442/2011 (published in the Official Journal of the European Union, L121, 10.4.2011, p1), now repealed.</p>

<p>These sanctions were then consolidated and updated by new restrictive measures announced in Council Decision 2011/782/<abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">CFSP</abbr> (published in the Official Journal of the European Union L319, 2.12.2011, p56). This Decision came into force on 1 December 2011 and implemented by Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 36/2012.</p>

<p>On 27 February 2012, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> imposed new measures on Syria which were adopted in Council Decision 2012/122/<abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">CFSP</abbr> (published in OJ L54, 28.2.2012, p14). Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 168/2012 of 27 February 2012 (published in OJ L54, 28.2.2012, p1) implements the measures outlined in this Decision and also amends Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 36/2012.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> have also adopted Council Decision 2012/123/<abbr title="Common Foreign and Security Policy">CFSP</abbr> of 27 February 2012 which concerns the partial suspension of the application of the Co-operation Agreement between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the Syrian Arab Republic.</p>

<p>On 15 June 2012, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> imposed Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 509/2012. This new regulation came into force on 17 June 2012 and is published in OJ L156, 16.6.2012, p10. The regulation further amends Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 36/2012.</p>
