See HMRC's [technical guidance](/expenses-and-benefits-childcare/technical-guidance \"technical guidace\") on childcare voucher exemption.^\r\n\r\n###Limits for exemption\r\n\r\nFor any employees who applied to join a childcare scheme you run before 6 April 2011, the limit is \u00a355 a week, or \u00a3243 a month.\r\n\r\n^There are different rules for employees who joined employer-supported childcare schemes on or after 6 April 2011.^\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that the limit for these employees depends on the rate of income tax they pay. The limits are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\nRate of income tax | Weekly exempt limit | Monthly exempt limit\r\n-|-|-\r\nBasic (20%) | \u00a355 | \u00a3243\r\nHigher (40%) | \u00a328 | \u00a3124 \r\nAdditional (50%) | \u00a322 | \u00a397\r\n\r\nYou'll need to carry out a 'basic earnings assessment' to work out the correct rate, and keep certain records.
