If you sell products in the UK it\u2019s likely that you already comply with standards in other EU countries (eg security for electrical goods). Exports to EU countries are called \u2018dispatches\u2019.\r\n\r\n##Commodity codes\r\nYou need a [commodity code](/finding-commodity-codes \"Find a commodity code\") for all exports in the EU. The code classifies your goods for tax and regulations. \r\n\r\n##Paying VAT on exports within the EU\r\nYou have to record all the goods sold to EU countries on your VAT return and [submit your return online](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/vat-online/submit.htm \"submit your VAT return\"){:rel=\"external\"} every quarter. \r\n\r\nFor goods worth more than \u00a3250,000 you\u2019ll also have to fill in an [Intrastat Declaration](/specialist/introduction-to-intrastat \"Intrastat Declaration\").\r\n\r\nIf your customer is VAT registered in their country, they\u2019ll pay VAT for the goods at their country\u2019s rate. You don\u2019t pay any VAT. You\u2019ll need your customer\u2019s VAT registration number for your VAT return and paperwork proving that the goods have been sent. \r\n\r\nIf your customer isn\u2019t VAT registered, you\u2019ll normally have to pay UK VAT on the goods you export. You\u2019ll only be exempt from paying VAT if you\u2019re responsible for the delivery of the goods and their value is above a certain amount called the \u2018distant selling threshold\u2019. In this case your customer covers the VAT. The threshold varies in each EU country. \r\n\r\nHMRC has [detailed VAT export information](http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&id=HMCE_CL_000152&propertyType=document \"Detailed VAT information\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n$C\r\n**VAT Helpline**  \r\n0845 010 9000  \r\n$C\r\n\r\n##Paying duty on exports within the EU\r\nYou don\u2019t have to pay duty on goods that have been produced in the EU and are then exported to another EU country. These goods are \u2018in free circulation\u2019.\r\n\r\nThis also covers goods from outside the EU if duty has already been paid on them. For example, an importer brings bicycles from China into the UK and pays duty on them. They are now in free circulation. You can buy the bicycles and export them to France without paying duty on them. \r\n\r\n*[EU]: European Union\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenues & Customs","slug":"exporting-to-eu-countries","title":"Exporting to EU countries"}},{"table":{"body":"Exports to countries outside the EU are called exports to 'third countries'. You need to submit an export declaration for these and may need an export licence. \r\n\r\nYou might also have to pay VAT, import taxes and duty in the destination country.\r\n\r\nExport regulations vary, depending on the country you\u2019re exporting to. \r\n\r\n##Commodity codes\r\nYou need a [commodity code](/finding-commodity-codes \"Find a commodity code\") for all exports outside the EU. The code classifies your goods for tax and regulations. \r\n\r\n##Export declarations\r\nIf you want to export goods to a third country, you must submit an electronic export declaration. You do this by:\r\n\r\n- registering for an [Economic Operator Registration Identification number](/specialist/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme \"Registering for an Economic Operator Registration Identification\")(EORI)  \r\n- registering for the [Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight system](/specialist/chief-trader-import-and-export-processing-system \"CHIEF system\") (CHIEF)  \r\n- submitting your export declaration through the National Export System (NES) - which is part of CHIEF\r\n\r\nMany businesses use an agent called a [freight forwarder](/freight-forwarders \"Freight forwarders\") to handle these declarations for them. \r\n\r\nSpecial rules apply if you\u2019re moving goods via other EU countries before exporting them to a third country. This is called \u2018indirect exports\u2019.\r\n\r\nThere is more information on [submitting declarations through NES.](/specialist/export-declarations-and-the-national-export-system-export-procedures \"Export declarations\")\r\n\r\n##Paying VAT on exports overseas\r\nYou have to record all the goods sold to non-EU countries on your VAT return. If you export goods worth more than \u00a3250,000 you\u2019ll also have to fill in an [Intrastat Declaration](/specialist/introduction-to-intrastat \"Intrastat Declaration\").\r\n\r\nVAT for third country exports depends on how the goods are sent, eg if you send them directly or through an agent and if your customer collects the goods. \r\n\r\nYou can apply to HMRC to be exempt from VAT on third country exports. This is called \u2018zero-rating\u2019. \r\n\r\nYou can zero-rate most goods but you must:\r\n\r\n- export your goods within three months after production or purchase \r\n- have documentation that the goods left the EU, eg a Goods Departure Message \r\n- have documentation that the goods have been sold to a party in the third country \r\n\r\n##Paying duty on exports to third countries\r\nDuty charges are set by the country you export to and depend on the type of goods, where they come from and their value.\r\n\r\nThe [UK Trade Tariff](/trade-tariff \"UK Trade Tariff\") lists the duty charges, tax, custom rules and paperwork for exports to third countries. \r\n\r\nYou might be able to claim duty charges and VAT back or delay payments for some exports outside the EU. \r\n\r\nThis is called ['duty relief'](/duty-relief-for-imports-and-exports \"other duty relief schemes\") and there are a number of schemes you can apply for. Some countries have trade agreements with the EU that allow you to export at lower or zero duty rates. In these cases you must usually be able to prove where the goods originally come from. \r\n\r\n##Export licences\r\nSometimes you might need a licence for exporting  goods to a third country. For example, agricultural goods or valuable antiques often need one. You\u2019ll have to get the licence from the relevant government organisation, eg Department for Agriculture of the Arts Council. \r\n\r\n[Detailed information on export licences.](/specialist/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence \"Detailed information on export licences\")\r\n\r\n*[EU]: European Union\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenues & Customs","slug":"exporting-to-noneu-countries","title":"Exporting to non-EU countries"}},{"table":{"body":"Moving goods through the EU to non-EU countries is known as ['indirect exports'](/specialist/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu \"Moving goods through the EU to non-EU countries\")\r\n\r\nIndirect exports need special procedures and paperwork, which generally depend on the final destination of your goods:\r\n\r\n - you must fill in an export declaration - even though the goods are initially moving through an EU country\r\n - [export licences and other controls](/specialist/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu \"Export licences and other controls\") will depend on the destination of your goods\r\n - you won't have to pay VAT on goods exported outside the EU, though you'll have to show proof that the goods actually left the EU\r\n\r\n*[EU]: European Union\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenues & Customs","slug":"exporting-via-other-eu-countries","title":"Exporting via other EU countries"}}],"type":"guide"}
