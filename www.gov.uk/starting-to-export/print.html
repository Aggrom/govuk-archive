  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to export goods to another country you have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>find the correct <a href="/finding-commodity-codes" title="Find a commodity code">commodity code</a> for your goods </li>
  <li>fill in a VAT return </li>
  <li>pay VAT in some cases </li>
  <li>register with <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <a href="/specialist/chief-trader-import-and-export-processing-system" title="CHIEF system">CHIEF system</a> for importers and exporters if you’re exporting outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> </li>
  <li>declare the goods you export using the CHIEF system </li>
  <li>pay duty in some cases </li>
</ul>
<p>The exact rules depend on where you’re exporting to. </p>

<p>You’ll also have to consider how the goods will be transported and what insurance you need. </p>

<p>You can use an <a href="/freight-forwarders" title="Freight forwarders">agent</a> if you don’t want to deal with export procedures yourself. </p>


</article><article id="exporting-to-eu-countries"><header><h1>Part 2: Exporting to EU countries</h1>
  </header><p>Regulations and product standards are the same in most European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states. If you sell products in the UK it’s likely that you already comply with standards in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries (eg security for electrical goods). Exports to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries are called ‘dispatches’.</p>

<h2>Commodity codes</h2>
<p>You need a <a href="/finding-commodity-codes" title="Find a commodity code">commodity code</a> for all exports in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The code classifies your goods for tax and regulations. </p>

<h2>Paying VAT on exports within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>
<p>You have to record all the goods sold to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on your VAT return and <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/vat-online/submit.htm" title="submit your VAT return">submit your return online</a> every quarter. </p>

<p>For goods worth more than £250,000 you’ll also have to fill in an <a href="/specialist/introduction-to-intrastat" title="Intrastat Declaration">Intrastat Declaration</a>.</p>

<p>If your customer is VAT registered in their country, they’ll pay VAT for the goods at their country’s rate. You don’t pay any VAT. You’ll need your customer’s VAT registration number for your VAT return and paperwork proving that the goods have been sent. </p>

<p>If your customer isn’t VAT registered, you’ll normally have to pay UK VAT on the goods you export. You’ll only be exempt from paying VAT if you’re responsible for the delivery of the goods and their value is above a certain amount called the ‘distant selling threshold’. In this case your customer covers the VAT. The threshold varies in each <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. </p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> has <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000152&amp;propertyType=document" title="Detailed VAT information">detailed VAT export information</a></p>

<h2>Paying duty on exports within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>
<p>You don’t have to pay duty on goods that have been produced in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and are then exported to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. These goods are ‘in free circulation’.</p>

<p>This also covers goods from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> if duty has already been paid on them. For example, an importer brings bicycles from China into the UK and pays duty on them. They are now in free circulation. You can buy the bicycles and export them to France without paying duty on them. </p>


</article><article id="exporting-to-noneu-countries"><header><h1>Part 3: Exporting to non-EU countries</h1>
  </header><p>Exports to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are called exports to ‘third countries’. You need to submit an export declaration for these and may need an export licence. </p>

<p>You might also have to pay VAT, import taxes and duty in the destination country.</p>

<p>Export regulations vary, depending on the country you’re exporting to. </p>

<h2>Commodity codes</h2>
<p>You need a <a href="/finding-commodity-codes" title="Find a commodity code">commodity code</a> for all exports outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The code classifies your goods for tax and regulations. </p>

<h2>Export declarations</h2>
<p>If you want to export goods to a third country, you must submit an electronic export declaration. You do this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>registering for an <a href="/specialist/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme" title="Registering for an Economic Operator Registration Identification">Economic Operator Registration Identification number</a>(EORI)  </li>
  <li>registering for the <a href="/specialist/chief-trader-import-and-export-processing-system" title="CHIEF system">Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight system</a> (CHIEF)  </li>
  <li>submitting your export declaration through the National Export System (NES) - which is part of CHIEF</li>
</ul>
<p>Many businesses use an agent called a <a href="/freight-forwarders" title="Freight forwarders">freight forwarder</a> to handle these declarations for them. </p>

<p>Special rules apply if you’re moving goods via other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries before exporting them to a third country. This is called ‘indirect exports’.</p>

<p>There is more information on <a href="/specialist/export-declarations-and-the-national-export-system-export-procedures" title="Export declarations">submitting declarations through NES.</a></p>

<h2>Paying VAT on exports overseas</h2>
<p>You have to record all the goods sold to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries on your VAT return. If you export goods worth more than £250,000 you’ll also have to fill in an <a href="/specialist/introduction-to-intrastat" title="Intrastat Declaration">Intrastat Declaration</a>.</p>

<p>VAT for third country exports depends on how the goods are sent, eg if you send them directly or through an agent and if your customer collects the goods. </p>

<p>You can apply to <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to be exempt from VAT on third country exports. This is called ‘zero-rating’. </p>

<p>You can zero-rate most goods but you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>export your goods within three months after production or purchase </li>
  <li>have documentation that the goods left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, eg a Goods Departure Message </li>
  <li>have documentation that the goods have been sold to a party in the third country </li>
</ul>
<h2>Paying duty on exports to third countries</h2>
<p>Duty charges are set by the country you export to and depend on the type of goods, where they come from and their value.</p>

<p>The <a href="/trade-tariff" title="UK Trade Tariff">UK Trade Tariff</a> lists the duty charges, tax, custom rules and paperwork for exports to third countries. </p>

<p>You might be able to claim duty charges and VAT back or delay payments for some exports outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. </p>

<p>This is called <a href="/duty-relief-for-imports-and-exports" title="other duty relief schemes">‘duty relief’</a> and there are a number of schemes you can apply for. Some countries have trade agreements with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> that allow you to export at lower or zero duty rates. In these cases you must usually be able to prove where the goods originally come from. </p>

<h2>Export licences</h2>
<p>Sometimes you might need a licence for exporting  goods to a third country. For example, agricultural goods or valuable antiques often need one. You’ll have to get the licence from the relevant government organisation, eg Department for Agriculture of the Arts Council. </p>

</article><article id="exporting-via-other-eu-countries"><header><h1>Part 4: Exporting via other EU countries</h1>
  </header><p>Moving goods through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries is known as <a href="/specialist/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu" title="Moving goods through the EU to non-EU countries">‘indirect exports’</a></p>

<p>Indirect exports need special procedures and paperwork, which generally depend on the final destination of your goods:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must fill in an export declaration - even though the goods are initially moving through an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</li>
  <li>
<a href="/specialist/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu" title="Export licences and other controls">export licences and other controls</a> will depend on the destination of your goods</li>
  <li>you won’t have to pay VAT on goods exported outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, though you’ll have to show proof that the goods actually left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
