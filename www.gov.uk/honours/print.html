<ul>
<li>making a difference to their community or field of work</li>
  <li>enhancing Britain’s reputation</li>
  <li>long-term voluntary service</li>
  <li>innovation and entrepreneurship</li>
  <li>changing things, with an emphasis on achievement</li>
  <li>improving life for people less able to help themselves</li>
  <li>displaying moral courage and vision in making and delivering tough choices</li>
</ul>
<p>Honours are given to people involved in different activities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>arts and media</li>
  <li>health</li>
  <li>education</li>
  <li>science and technology</li>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>As the nominator, you won’t hear anything for 12 to 18 months. </p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You should not tell the nominee that you have nominated them.</p>
</div>

<p>Honours committees made up of experts and civil servants compare similar nominations, eg teacher with teacher.</p>

</article><article id="types-of-honours-and-awards"><header><h1>Part 3: Types of honours and awards</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t nominate someone for a specific honour - that’s decided by the honours committee.</p>
</div>

<h2>Types of honours</h2>

<h3>Companion of Honour</h3>

<p>A major contribution to the arts, science, medicine, or government lasting over a long period of time.</p>

<h3>Knight/Dame</h3>

<p>A major contribution in any activity, usually at national level. Other people working in the nominee’s area will see their contribution as inspirational and significant, requiring commitment over a long period of time.</p>

<h3>Commander of the Order of the British Empire (<abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">CBE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>A prominent but lesser role at national level, or a leading role at regional level. You can also get one for a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area.</p>

<h3>Officer of the Order of the British Empire (<abbr title="Officer of the Order of the British Empire">OBE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>A major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally in their chosen area.</p>

<h3>Member of the Order of the British Empire (<abbr title="Member of the British Empire">MBE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>A significant achievement or outstanding service to the community. An <abbr title="Member of the British Empire">MBE</abbr> is also awarded for local ‘hands-on’ service which stands out as an example to other people.</p>

<h3>British Empire Medal (<abbr title="British Empire Medal">BEM</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Reintroduced in 2012, this rewards a sustained, local contribution or innovative, high-impact work of a relatively short duration (eg 3 to 4 years).</p>

<h2>Which order?</h2>

<p>The committee decides which order someone should be a member of. You don’t have to specify this in your nomination.</p>

</article><article id="honours-lists"><header><h1>Part 4: Honours lists</h1>
  </header><p>The lists of who’s received honours are published in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/recent/10/state/honours/start=1" title="London Gazette honours publications">London Gazette</a> on New Year’s Day and the Queen’s birthday in June.</p>

</article><article id="having-honours-taken-away"><header><h1>Part 5: Having honours taken away</h1>
  </header><p>Someone’s who’s been given an honour and has done something to bring the honours system into disrepute can have their honour taken away (‘forfeited’). Examples include if someone has been:</p>

<ul>
<li>sentenced to imprisonment of at least 3 months for a criminal offence</li>
  <li>censured, struck off etc by a relevant professional or regulatory authority for something directly relevant to the granting of the honours (eg a doctor has been struck off)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other criteria can be considered as well. The Honours Forfeiture Committee’s discussions are confidential.</p>

<h2>Forfeiture - what happens</h2>

<p>The Honours Forfeiture Committee looks at the evidence and considers the case. If the committee makes a recommendation that an order should be forfeited, it is submitted to the Queen by the Prime Minister. The Queen decides if the honour should be forfeited.</p>

<p>If someone’s honour is forfeited it’s published in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/" title="London Gazette">London Gazette.</a></p>

</article><article id="members-of-honours-committees"><header><h1>Part 6: Members of honours committees</h1>
  </header><p>Honours committees are made up of senior civil servants (‘official members’) and people who are independent of government (‘independent members’). All honours committees have a majority of members who are independent.</p>
