<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide will give you an overview of the procedures involved when selling or dispatching goods to any of the 27 member states that make up the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), one of the world’s largest trading markets. Croatia, FYR Macedonia and Turkey are currently negotiating to join.</p>

<p>Goods leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and destined for a country outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (commonly known as a third country), eg goods moving from the UK to the USA, are known as exports. Export processes are covered in a dedicated guide on this site.</p>

<p>Dispatching within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is relatively straightforward and legislation does not change often but traders must keep up with changes. You must, for example, know how to handle VAT, when to report your sales figures for Intrastat statistics, and whether your goods are subject to licensing or other controls.</p>

<p>For specific information on selling goods to countries outside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu">exporting your goods outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-european-union-as-a-single-market">The European Union as a single market</h2>

<p>Four key freedoms of the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) benefit traders in all 27 member states. These are the free movement of goods, capital, services and persons.</p>

<p>In practical terms, this means that most shipments can be dispatched to other member states of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without special customs documentation. There are exceptions, eg sales to international organisations, which are treated as exports, and exports to special <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> territories. For more information, <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;resetCT=true&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_008051">read a basic guide to trading abroad on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>The main exclusions to this are goods subject to export licensing controls, eg military goods or Class A drugs, and goods classed as excise products, eg alcohol, tobacco and hydrocarbon oils.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Austria</li>
  <li>Belgium</li>
  <li>Bulgaria</li>
  <li>Cyprus*</li>
  <li>Czech Republic</li>
  <li>Denmark</li>
  <li>Estonia</li>
  <li>Finland</li>
  <li>France</li>
  <li>Germany</li>
  <li>Greece</li>
  <li>Hungary</li>
  <li>The Republic of Ireland</li>
  <li>Italy</li>
  <li>Latvia</li>
  <li>Lithuania</li>
  <li>Luxembourg</li>
  <li>Malta</li>
  <li>The Netherlands</li>
  <li>Poland</li>
  <li>Portugal</li>
  <li>Romania</li>
  <li>Slovakia</li>
  <li>Spain</li>
  <li>Slovenia</li>
  <li>Sweden</li>
</ul>
<p>*The European Commission has advised that the application of the 6th VAT Directive (Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977) shall be suspended in those areas of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control. Goods to these destinations continue to be eligible for zero-rating as exports.</p>

<p>Goods in movement within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are termed as being dispatched upon leaving the state of origin of the goods, and as arrivals when entering the member state acquiring them. The use of these terms distinguishes single market trade from international trade with third countries - ie countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, where the terms import and export apply.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm">Find out how the single market works for citizens and traders on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="vat-within-the-eu-and-with-other-trade-agreement-countries">VAT within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and with other trade agreement countries</h2>

<p>If you supply goods to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country these sales are technically known as dispatches or removals rather than exports. The term “exports” is reserved to describe sales to a third country outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Dispatches within the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) between VAT-registered businesses are not subject to VAT. This also applies to goods imported into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> that have been released for free circulation following payment of import duties.</p>

<p>However, when you dispatch goods to someone in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, who is not registered for VAT in that country, you should normally charge VAT.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/exports/goods.htm">Read about charging VAT on exports, dispatches and supplying goods abroad on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Customs declarations are not generally required for goods in free circulation within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, but traders must remember to raise VAT invoices showing the VAT Registration number of their customers and obtain evidence of shipment.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-handle-vat-within-the-eu">How to handle VAT within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customer is VAT-registered and can provide you with a valid <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> VAT registration number:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can apply the zero-rate of VAT to the sale</li>
  <li>the VAT will be due in the destination country from the customer on acquisition of the goods</li>
  <li>you must keep paperwork that shows both the seller’s and buyer’s VAT registration numbers (with the correct national codes) on the invoice</li>
  <li>you must number your sales invoices in sequence</li>
  <li>you must also obtain and keep valid evidence that the goods have been removed from the UK within certain time limits to be able to zero-rate</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about zero rating in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses">VAT rates explained: standard, reduced, zero, exempt</a>.</p>

<p>However if your buyer is not VAT registered, or you cannot obtain their VAT number, then as the seller you must charge the UK rate of VAT.</p>

<h3 id="intrastat-returns">Intrastat returns</h3>

<p>Every business trading within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has to declare its sales on its VAT return. If your sales of goods exceed the applicable exemption threshold during a calendar year, you must also submit Intrastat returns each month.</p>

<p>Every VAT-registered business trading goods with other European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states is obliged to declare certain information. The amount of information required depends on the value of their Arrivals (purchases or imports) or Dispatches (sales or exports).</p>

<p>Intrastat thresholds are reviewed annually. The 2012 thresholds, which remain the same as 2011, are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>Businesses with Dispatches or Arrivals of goods below this threshold are only required to declare the value of Dispatches (sales or exports) to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states in box 8 and the value of Arrivals (purchases or imports) acquired from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states in box 9 on their standard VAT return.</p>

<p>Businesses with Dispatches to or Arrivals from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> above the Intrastat exemption threshold must also submit monthly Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>) to HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>

<p>Larger businesses trading above the 2012 Intrastat delivery terms threshold of £16 million - this remains the same as 2011 - must also specify delivery terms information on their <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="vat-treatment-in-the-eu-differs-to-vat-for-international-trade">VAT treatment in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> differs to VAT for international trade</h3>

<p>VAT is handled differently depending on whether you’re selling to a customer within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Read about charging VAT on exports, dispatches and supplying goods abroad on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</p>

<p>For dispatches or exports, <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/ecip/documents/procedures/export_exit_guidelines_en.pdf">download guidelines on security declarations on export and exit provisions from the Europa website (PDF, 272K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="international-trade-agreements-and-free-trade-associations">International trade agreements and free trade associations</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> also has several trade agreements in place with countries that aren’t <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> members.</p>

<p>While as yet still an associate member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Turkey is in a customs union with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and thus has a relatively free market for UK exports of goods and services. Goods from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> members receive preferential treatment if they are in free circulation within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (eg wholly made or customs duties paid). Turkey follows similar customs procedures to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.</p>

<p>Customs documents are required for exports to Turkey including a preferential statement on the movement certificates called an ATR Form if the goods are in free circulation.</p>

<p>The Isle of Man is in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, as part of its customs union and VAT agreement with the UK. The Channel Islands aren’t in the fiscal territory of the European Community but are part of the customs territory.</p>

<p>Export declarations for shipments to the Channel Islands aren’t generally required for goods in free circulation within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, but traders must use sequentially numbered VAT invoices. For controlled goods an export declaration using the National Export System is still required. It is recommended that traders supply a detailed commercial invoice. As with exports to third countries, traders can reclaim VAT once they prove goods have left the UK. There are restrictions on some goods, particularly agricultural goods and chemicals - for instance, it’s illegal to import hay and straw (even as packing material) into Jersey.</p>

<p>The European Free Trade Association’s (<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr>) four member states are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Three <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) belong to the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), uniting the 27 <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries and the <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> states in an internal market. The market enables goods and services to move freely in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> in an open and competitive environment. Switzerland has separate trade arrangements with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. All <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> members now benefit from virtually the same privileged relationship among themselves as they do with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For trading purposes, goods moved from <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> members states are treated similarly to goods moved between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states. </p>

<h3 id="declarations-duties-and-licences-for-dispatches-within-the-eu">Declarations, duties and licences for dispatches within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You don’t usually need to complete a customs declaration for goods sold within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. There are exceptions, eg sales to international organisations and special territories.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> principle of free circulation allows for goods produced in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to be moved around the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without paying duty. Goods imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> may also qualify for free circulation once all import formalities have been completed and import duty and any other customs charges paid. This means that such goods can be sold on the Community market like any product made in the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Some types of dispatch goods, such as weapons and drugs, are controlled and may require an export licence and other appropriate commercial paperwork. </p>

<p>This section explains what excise goods are, and how traders must comply with paperwork and payment requirements. It also tells you about the paperwork you need to complete for all dispatches.</p>

<h3 id="excise-duty">Excise duty</h3>

<p>Excise is a tax that <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> charges on beer, wine, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, hydrocarbon oils (including fuel and petrol), cigarettes and tobacco that are acquired, imported or produced in the UK.</p>

<p>Under a relief scheme, goods may be consigned in duty suspension, which delays the payment of duty, to one of the following in the UK:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>an approved excise warehouse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registered Consignees and Temporary Registered Consignees</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_025227&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 197 for more on excise warehouses on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_030355&amp;propertyType=document">see Notice 203A on the Registered Consignee scheme on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="excise-duty-drawback">Excise duty drawback</h3>

<p>There are also schemes, such as excise duty drawback, to suspend duty on excise goods moving within European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states. To claim, you must be running a business and you must supply the original duty payment document and may need to show an audit trail between the goods and duty paid. Additional information is necessary if you are not the business that originally paid the duty. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000224">Read Notice 207 about excise drawback eligibility on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>. Consignments must be accompanied by the correct documentation (excise movement certificate) and financial security - a guarantee given by an approved guarantor who undertakes to pay money to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in the event of an irregularity covered by the guarantee or bond. You must use <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s electronic Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) to provide an electronic Administrative Accompanying Document (e-AAD) for duty-paid goods moving within the UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/emcs/index.htm">Read about EMCS on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Spirits and wine with 30% alcohol or above, in bottles containing 35 centilitres or more, must bear a duty stamp when they pass the UK excise duty point and are released for sale. The stamp indicates that tax has either been paid or is due to be paid. To obtain duty stamps, traders must register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_024493&amp;propertyType=document%20">Read about the UK duty stamps scheme on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You should ensure that the two-letter codes for the country of dispatch and destination of each member state are used for the completion of accompanying documentation. <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/CodesAndGuides/Pages/Country.aspx">Find a list of all country codes at the uktradeinfo website</a>. Commercial invoices should reflect the changes required by the use of these two-letter codes.</p>

<h2 id="compliance-with-intrastat">Compliance with Intrastat</h2>

<p>Intrastat is the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)-wide system of collecting information from VAT-registered traders to provide an overview of the dispatch and acquisition of goods between member states of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. See the overview guide to Intrastat.</p>

<p>Intrastat only collects information about goods - services are not generally included.</p>

<p>Every business trading within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has to declare its sales goods on its VAT return. If your sales exceed the exemption threshold during a calendar year you must also submit Intrastat returns each month.</p>

<p>The declarations are known as Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>). Intrastat thresholds are reviewed annually. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/imports-exports">See an explanation of Intrastat exemption thresholds</a>. The 2011 thresholds are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches. The requirement to submit Intrastat Declarations is only applicable to VAT-registered traders.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Intrastat/StepByStep/Pages/introduction.aspx">Find out how to submit your return on the Intrastat step by step guide on the uktradeinfo website</a>.</p>

<p>Intrastat issues a list of commodity classification codes for goods, which you must use on the returns (these numbers must not be used for trade with countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as there are differences).</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/TradeTools/ICN/Pages/ICNSearch.aspx">find commodity codes and other measures applying to Arrivals and Dispatches for Intrastat by accessing the free online Intrastat Classification Nomenclature on the uktradeinfo website</a>.</p>

<p>When you fill out the <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>, you’ll need to provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>the commodity code of the goods</li>
  <li>the value of the goods in sterling</li>
  <li>net mass or supplementary unit of the goods (depending on the commodity code used)</li>
  <li>nature of the transaction, eg sale</li>
  <li>the destination of the goods</li>
  <li>your agent’s details, if appropriate</li>
  <li>delivery terms details if your trade exceeds the delivery terms threshold, currently set at £16 million</li>
</ul>
<p>If your Intrastat return is late or inaccurate, you may have to pay a penalty. For more information, see the sections on where to get help and advice in Intrastat and Supplementary Declarations and penalties for late or inaccurate Intrastat Supplementary Declarations in the guide Intrastat - duty to report statistics.</p>

<h2 id="prohibitions-restrictions-and-licences">Prohibitions, restrictions and licences</h2>

<p>This section explains the types of dispatch that need an export licence and how to apply for one. Export licences are not generally required to dispatch from the UK to European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member states. However, there are restrictions on movements of certain goods. Most goods aren’t restricted, but some, including chemicals and military and paramilitary goods, need a licence, permit or certificate.</p>

<p>There may be licensing or certification requirements that apply to food or agricultural produce dispatched within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. You may need to contact the customs authorities in the country of destination in individual cases. For more information on trading in agricultural and food products, read international trade products and schemes: the basics.</p>

<p>If your business includes trade in certain services, you must make sure specific information is available to your customers about how you work before you complete contracts or make agreements.</p>

<p>From 2013 onwards, special rules will also apply to firms supplying communications and media services.</p>

<p>You will need to check with government departments for individual licence requirements. Common licences include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Licences needed to dispatch certain objects of cultural interest that are more than 50 years old and above certain financial thresholds. You can apply to the Export Licensing Unit of the Arts Council. <a rel="external" href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/media/uploads/pdf/Guidance_for_Exporters_Issue_1_2011_ACE_web_version-1.pdf">Download guidance on cultural goods for exporters from the Arts Council website (PDF, 195K)</a>.</li>
  <li>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) licences are required to dispatch live animals and animal products, and health inspections may be required as well. Dispatches of endangered plant and animal species and products made from them require Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora licences. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">Find information on animal dispatch and trade procedures on the Defra website</a>.</li>
  <li>Defra controls the dispatch of ozone-depleting substances (ODS). ODS include refrigeration and air-conditioning products, fire-fighting and foam blowing equipment and aerosols and solvents. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/consumer-issues/docs/aerosol-dispensers-guidance.pdf">Download a booklet on aerosol dispensers from the BIS website (PDF, 583K)</a>.</li>
  <li>Licences for medicines. <a rel="external" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=26">Read about dispatch licences on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency website</a>.</li>
  <li>Licences for controlled drugs. <a rel="external" href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/licensing/import-export/">Find information on dispatching controlled drugs on the Home Office website</a>.</li>
  <li>Licences for rough diamonds that have arrived in the UK from a third (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) country and are on their way to another member state.</li>
  <li>A European Community Catch Certificate and Re-Export Certificate is required for dispatches of certain fish species. See illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</li>
  <li>Licences are required for moving dangerous chemicals outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/chip/pic.htm">Read about Prior Informed Consent for trade in dangerous chemicals on the Health &amp; Safety Executive website</a>.</li>
  <li>Under REACH legislation, importers or manufacturers of more than one tonne of chemicals a year must register with the European Chemicals Agency and build an inventory of every chemical that comes into, is part of, or goes out of the business. <a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/reach_en.asp">Read about REACH legislation on the European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>) website</a>.</li>
  <li>Licences for personally dispatched firearms - unless the traveller carrying the firearm possesses a European Firearms Pass. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/firearms-and-export-control-forms">firearms and export control forms</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="licences-for-strategic-military-and-dual-use-goods">Licences for strategic military and dual-use goods</h3>

<p>All military controlled items and some highly sensitive dual-use goods (ie those listed on Annex IV of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List) need a licence, even if the goods are being dispatched to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/beginners-guide-to-export-controls">export controls: an introductory guide</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">strategic exports: when to request an export licence</a>. </p>

<p>Less sensitive controlled dual-use goods exports need a licence if shipped outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Controls also apply to the brokering - which can include warehousing and shipping - and transport of dual-use goods. Read guidance about<a href="https://www.gov.uk/brokering-trade-of-dual-use-items">brokering (trade) of dual-use items)</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List is published in the UK as part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">UK Strategic Export Control Lists</a>. This list of controlled goods includes a wide ranging variety of dual-use goods such as lasers, telecommunications equipment and much more.</p>

<p>All military goods - listed on the UK Military List which forms part of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists - require an export licence to all destinations including <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>Dual-use goods are controlled depending on their technical specifications or performance. In general, you only need a licence to export outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. However, you will need a licence for some highly sensitive items - such as nuclear materials - even if exporting to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. These items are listed in Annex IV of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use List (part of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists).</p>

<p>When you export to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country (known as an intra-community transfer), your commercial documentation needs to clearly state whether the items are controlled if exported outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Relevant commercial documents include, in particular, any sales contract, order confirmation, invoice or dispatch note.</p>

<p>You may also need a licence for brokering of military goods. Read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-controls-on-controlled-military-goods">trafficking and brokering (trade controls)</a>. </p>

<p>For a general overview about strategic export controls, see the guide about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/beginners-guide-to-export-controls">export controls: an introductory guide</a>. </p>

<h2 id="communitycommon-transit-procedures">Community/common transit procedures</h2>

<p>This section gives an overview of transit options and explains what the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) is.</p>

<h3 id="customs-status-of-goods">Customs status of goods</h3>

<p>Customs status defines goods in transit in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as being either Community or non-Community goods. Community goods are those goods that originate in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or which have been imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and released for free circulation, ie all import formalities have been completed and duties paid. These goods do not normally require Community Transit (CT) declarations.</p>

<p>You will however need to use CT to move:</p>

<ul>
<li>non-community goods - goods imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for which the payment of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> duty and completion of import formalities are still pending.</li>
  <li>both Community and non-Community goods to and from Andorra, San Marino and the ‘special territories’ of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, such as the Channel Islands.</li>
  <li>goods to and via European Free Trade Association (<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr>) countries, and other signatories to the Common Transit Convention, where it is known as Common Transit. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are other transit procedures for moving goods within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For more information see the guide on transit and other suspensive regimes.</p>

<p>The NCTS is a system available throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries for the submission of electronic transit declarations and for controlling transit movements by a series of information messages. For further information, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transit-and-other-suspensive-regimes">transit and other suspensive regimes</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/using-the-new-computerised-transit-system-to-move-goods-across-the-EU-and-EFTA-countries">using the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) to move goods across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries</a>.</p>

<h2 id="heres-how-we-started-building-markets-in-the-eu">Here’s how we started building markets in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<h3 id="howard-flood">Howard Flood</h3>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.warmup.co.uk/">Warmup plc</a></p>

<h3 id="howards-top-tips">Howards’ top tips:</h3>

<ul>
<li>“Tailor your marketing as your customer base won’t necessarily be the same across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Always be prepared to adapt your approach.”</li>
  <li>“Never just assume if you can sell your product in one member state that you can automatically in another. While regulations are harmonised, you still find specific requirements in some member states.”</li>
  <li>“Always have a local presence, but make sure you get your local representative to spend time with the UK part of the business so they understand and believe the culture of the business here.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Under-floor heating system manufacturer and retailer Warmup plc is based in north-west London. The business sells its products via retailers, building contractors and direct to consumers, and has customers in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Spain, Portugal and the USA. Howard Flood, international director at the company, explains how the firm started trading in the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>

<h4 id="understand-each-markets-needs">Understand each market’s needs</h4>

<p>“It’s essential that you visit each target market and walk many miles in your potential customers’ shoes. You need to understand what makes them tick and what triggers purchasing decisions.</p>

<p>“While the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is a single market, there are significant practical and cultural nuances from member state to member state. For example, in cooler climates, such as Germany and the Netherlands, most houses are carpeted, whereas in warmer countries such as Spain and Portugal there’s a greater use of floor tiling. For us, that means our sales methods, features and benefits and target customers are different.</p>

<p>“In the warmer climates, we work with architects and builders to get our products in at the specification and build stage, but in cooler climates we trade through specific retailers to catch the electrical contractors and those actually installing the product, such as professional master tilers and the DIY market.”</p>

<h4 id="stay-close-to-your-markets">Stay close to your markets</h4>

<p>“We directly employed sales people in the local markets. They can spot any issues that might arise, whether they are language related, cultural or otherwise. It’s more difficult to grasp these problems from the UK.</p>

<p>“For example, in one of our markets, we were advised by our local office to make sure that we additionally shipped installation instructions in Polish - as they were seeing a rise in the number of migrant Polish workers in that area. Without that local knowledge, we would still have been providing instructions for installers in a language that wasn’t native to them.”</p>

<h4 id="get-the-right-stockholding">Get the right stockholding</h4>

<p>“In member states where we also have a warehouse presence, it helps us to keep a reasonable amount there, but without tying too much cash up in stock. For markets where we supply to order, particularly where our product is installed in new builds, it’s essential for timely delivery so as not to hold up the construction. It’s also well worth negotiating as much lead time with customers as you can, to give room for manoeuvre on manufacturing and delivery.”</p>

<h3 id="what-id-do-differently">What I’d do differently</h3>

<h4 id="take-a-closer-look-at-country-specific-regulations">Take a closer look at country-specific regulations</h4>

<p>“We’re fortunate that our product generally translates well across all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> markets as the voltages required are compatible. However, while our British Electrotechnical Approvals Board mark has been enough to meet standards in most markets, we found out that we’d need an additional local certification in France. That’s slowed our progress there a little, so it would have been useful to know it was compulsory slightly earlier.”  </p>
