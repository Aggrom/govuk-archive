<p>These commodities are covered in chapter 95 of the Tariff, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>indoor and outdoor games</li>
  <li>toys and items for the amusement of children and/or adults</li>
  <li>equipment for sports, gymnastics, and athletics</li>
  <li>requisites for fishing, hunting and shooting</li>
</ul>
<p>When looking to classify toys, games and sports equipment, bear in mind that:</p>

<ul>
<li>toys are generally under heading code 9503</li>
  <li>games are generally under heading codes 9504 and 9505</li>
  <li>sports equipment is generally under heading codes 9506 and 9507</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth checking to make sure you’re using the correct classification, as toys and games may be interchangeable terms for some people. If you cannot find the correct classification in one category, it’s a good idea to check the other.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-toys">Classifying toys</h2>

<p>Most toys, whether for adults or children, are under subheadings of heading code 9503. Toys intended for animals, such as pets, are classified by their basic material.</p>

<p>The classification listings are quite detailed to cover the majority of specific commodities.</p>

<h3 id="tricycles-scooters-pedal-cars-and-similar-toys">Tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar toys</h3>

<p>In classification terms, these are restricted to wheeled toys designed to be driven by children and powered or propelled by the children themselves using pedals, hand levers or motors. The key heading code for these items is 9503 10. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>children’s tricycles and similar items. Bear in mind, however, that bicycles for children are classified as bicycles, using heading code 8712.</li>
  <li>scooters</li>
  <li>pedal or hand-propelled wheeled toys in the form of animals</li>
  <li>pedal cars or motorised cars, often in the form of miniature sports cars, jeeps or lorries</li>
  <li>wheeled toys propelled by hand levers</li>
  <li>other wheeled toys designed to be drawn or pushed and large enough for children to ride in</li>
</ul>
<p>Practical devices for children to sit in, such as baby walkers, aren’t classed as toys and are therefore handled under a different chapter, using heading code 9403. Other exceptions include items without wheels, such as rocking horses, which would be classified under heading code 9503 00 41, as they’re usually stuffed and represent animals.</p>

<h3 id="dolls-representing-humans-their-parts-and-accessories">Dolls representing humans, their parts and accessories</h3>

<p>Dolls are generally covered by two heading codes - 9503 00 21 for dolls themselves and 9503 00 29 for their parts and accessories. These heading codes cover dolls designed for use as toys by adults or children, but also include dolls used for decorative purposes, such as mascot dolls or boudoir dolls. Remember that dolls only representing humans are covered by these classification codes. Dolls representing non-human figures, such as robots, devils or angels, for example, are classified under heading codes 9503 00 41 or 9503 00 49, even if they have human characteristics. See the information on general toys below for more details.</p>

<p>Parts and accessories covered by 9503 00 29 include:</p>

<ul>
<li>heads</li>
  <li>bodies</li>
  <li>limbs</li>
  <li>eyes (other than those unmounted on the dolls and made of glass, which are classified under heading code 7018)</li>
  <li>moving mechanisms and their parts</li>
  <li>voice-producing mechanisms</li>
  <li>wigs</li>
  <li>dolls’ clothing, shoes and hats</li>
  <li>feeding bottles, rattles, handbags and any other articles of limited functionality and sized to be used in play scenarios alongside dolls</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some specific commodities that are covered by different heading codes, however. Musical boxes with a doll attached are classified under heading code 9208. Tin soldiers without moving parts and/or removable clothing are classified under heading code 9503 00 85, as they’re essentially die-cast models made of metal, rather than dolls. Larger figures used for shop window displays have their own heading code of 9618.</p>

<h3 id="general-toys">General toys</h3>

<p>Train sets, including trains, tracks and signals, along with scale model assembly kits, such as for planes, boats or vehicles, are classified under heading code 9503 00 30. Construction kits, such as building blocks and the like, are covered by heading code 9503 00 35. The key point of difference for these two classifications is that if the toy kit is designed to be permanently assembled, such as a model car or aeroplane kit, it’ll be classified in the former heading code. If it’s designed to be constructed and deconstructed, like plastic building blocks, it’ll be classified under the latter category.</p>

<p>Toys and other play items representing non-human figures are covered by heading codes 9503 00 41 if they’re stuffed, and 9503 00 49 if they’re not stuffed. You should bear in mind that this will include fictional figures that may have some human characteristics, such as angels, devils, monsters or robots, for example. It also includes hand and finger puppets and figures used in marionette shows.</p>

<p>Toy musical instruments are classified under heading code 9503 00 55. These are distinguished from ‘full’ musical instruments by having limited capabilities - an inability to produce the range of notes of its adult counterpart, for example. Electrically operated instruments, such as organs, are also classified here. Toy musical apparatus, such as children’s-record players or CD players that play rigid plastic discs rather than standard records or CDs, are also covered in this heading code, as are toy musical boxes and other items that have a wind-up mechanism and play a limited range of tunes.</p>

<p>Heading code 9503 00 61 covers puzzles of all types, including jigsaws, sliders or Rubik’s cubes.</p>

<h3 id="other-toys-put-up-in-sets-or-outfits">9503 00 70 Other toys, put up in sets or outfits</h3>

<p>‘Sets’ of this subheading consist of two or more different types of articles (principally for amusement), put up in the same packing for retail sale without repacking.</p>

<p>Articles of the same subheading, except for items covered by subheadings 9503 00 95 or 9503 00 99 (as these subheadings may include miscellaneous articles of different types), are not to be considered different types of articles.</p>

<p>Apart from the articles forming a set, simple accessories or objects of minor importance intended to be used with the articles (for example, a plastic carrot or a plastic brush for a toy animal) can be present.</p>

<p>By virtue of Note 4 to Chapter 95, this subheading includes sets intended for the amusement of children, consisting of articles of heading 9503 combined with one or more items which, if presented separately, would be classified in other headings, provided that the combinations have the essential character of toys. Examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li>sets consisting of toys in the form of injection moulds and moulds for modelling pastes together with other items such as tubes or tablets of paint, modelling pastes, pencils and chalks</li>
  <li>cosmetic sets for children containing articles of heading 9503 combined with preparations of heading 3304</li>
</ul>
<p>However, cosmetic sets for children containing preparations of heading 3304 which do not contain any articles of heading 9503 are excluded (heading 3304).</p>

<p>‘Outfits’ of this subheading consist of two or more different articles put up in the same packing for retail sale, without repacking, and are specific to a particular type of recreation, work, person or profession, such as instructional and educational toys.</p>

<p>Toy weapons, such as guns, rifles, swords and water pistols are under heading code 9503 00 81.</p>

<p>Heading codes 9503 00 85, 9503 00 95 and 9503 00 99 cover a wide variety of toys not covered specifically elsewhere including:</p>

<ul>
<li>toy balloons</li>
  <li>toy kites</li>
  <li>toy tools and implements</li>
  <li>magic lanterns</li>
  <li>toy spectacles and sunglasses without prescription lenses or UV protection</li>
  <li>dolls houses and furniture</li>
  <li>toy counting frames</li>

<h2 id="classifying-games">Classifying games</h2>

<p>Most games are classified under the heading codes 9504 and 9505. The heading codes cover a variety of commodities in some detail. However, it’s a good idea to check heading code 9503 if you can’t find what you’re looking for, as what you may be viewing as a game may be classified as a toy.</p>

<h3 id="video-games">Video games</h3>

<h3 id="seasonal-items-and-fancy-dress">Seasonal items and fancy dress</h3>

<p>Entertainment items that tie in to specific times of year, such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween, birthdays or carnivals are covered under heading code 9505. If your goods are specifically and clearly intended for seasonal use, for example, figures that will only be used in a nativity set, they should be classified under this heading code. Many of these items will be made from non-durable materials.</p>

<p>Following is some general guidance for the type of items that are and are not included in heading code 9505.</p>

<p>Christmas items, such as Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings and sacks, Christmas cake decorations and soft stuffed toys and ornaments representing Father Christmas in human form are included in the heading code.</p>

<p>However, Christmas cracker gifts imported separately from the cracker are not included. These are classified by their description or basic material.

<p>Halloween items, such as decorations of vampires, witches, ghosts, skeletons and door plaques that re-create screams, are included in the heading code, but dolls representing witches, skeletons or wizards are excluded (heading code 9502). Fancy dress garments made from textiles are also excluded (classified under Chapter 61 or 62).</p>

<p>Birthday items, such as cake decorations, badges displaying birthday ages, banners or buntings with birthday-related messages printed on them, are included.</p>

<p>Carnival items, such as paper streamers, ticker tape or confetti, are included, but fancy dress garments made from textiles are excluded (classified under Chapter 61 or 62).</p>

<p>Festive papers and plastic wrappings are classified by their basic material (usually classified under Chapter 39 or 48).</p>

<p>The following types of goods aren’t covered in this guide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sportswear, such as sports shoes or clothing. Clothing is largely classified according to the material from which it’s made - check Section XI (Chapter 61 or Chapter 62) of the Tariff. Footwear is covered in Chapter 64 of the Tariff.</li>
  <li>Bicycles for children are covered in Chapter 87 of the Tariff.</li>
  <li>Accessories for cycling, such as bells, mirrors and drinks holders are covered according to the nature of their basic parts. For example, plastic mirrors are covered in Chapter 39 of the Tariff, while glass mirrors come under Chapter 70.</li>
  <li>Paints for children are classified under Chapter 32. Crayons and pastels are classified in Chapter 96, heading code 09.</li>
  <li>Children’s books (including those for drawing and colouring in) are classified in Chapter 49.</li>
  <li>Lottery tickets, scratch cards, raffle tickets and tombola tickets are generally classified under Chapter 49.</li>
  <li>Strings for tennis and other rackets are defined as textiles and covered in Section XI of the Tariff according to the material used.</li>
  <li>Sports bags and gloves. Sports bags are classified under Chapter 42. Sports gloves are classified according to their basic material - * Chapter 39 for plastic, Chapter 42 for leather or Chapter 61 or Chapter 62 if textile.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="materials-considerations">Materials considerations</h3>

<p>Goods are often classified in the Tariff according to the materials from which they’re made, referred to as ‘constituent material’. For example, a puzzle made of wood will be classified differently from a puzzle made of other materials. However, there’ll be occasions when your goods are made from more than one material.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, you should classify the goods according to the material that gives it its ‘essential character’, for example a model car may be made using die-cast metal, although may feature some trim made from plastics. In this case, it’s the die-cast metal that provides the ‘essential character’ and it should be classified as such.</p>

<h3 id="sets-outfits-and-collections">Sets, outfits and collections</h3>

<p>When two different types of articles used together for amusement are packaged for retail sale, they should be classified as ‘sets’ or ‘outfits’, using Chapter 95, heading code 0300. This is referred to as using the ‘General Interpretive Rule’ (GIR).</p>

<p>You should also follow this principle when packaging collections of items that would otherwise be classified in a variety of heading codes, such as chemistry sets, sewing kits or sports kits for tennis, football or cricket.</p>

<p>Sets and outfits are two or more articles packaged together to achieve the same play function, for example a toy dog packaged with a kennel and small bone. Sets and outfits that comprise goods that would be classified individually under different headings can be classified under the one heading that gives the set its essential characteristics.</p>

<p>For example, a plastic doll dressed in a skirt, top and shoes would be classified under 9503 00 21 00. A plastic chair for a doll to sit in would be classified under 9503 00 95 00. Using Note 3 to Chapter 95, a chair would be classified as an accessory to the doll. However, if they’re packaged together, the essential characteristic of the set would be the doll, so the set can be classified under the doll’s heading of 9503 00 21 00.</p>

<p>If the goods are packaged together for retail sale but not integral parts of the same amusement or play function, such as a package containing both a jigsaw puzzle and a chess set, you must classify them with the Tariff code that comes last in numerical order. In this example, a jigsaw puzzle would be classified under 9503 00 61 90 while a chess set would come under a heading code of 9504 90 90. So, when packaged together, it would be classified under 9504 90 90 00.</p>

<p>However, if the set or collection comprises the same commodity (for example, a package containing six plastic dolls), it must be classified according to its defining characteristics. In this case it should be classified as plastic dolls and not as a set or collection.</p>
