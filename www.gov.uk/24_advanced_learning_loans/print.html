</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The amount you’ll get depends on: </p>

<ul>
<li>the type of course you take</li>
  <li>how much the fees are</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum loan you can get is £300.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t have to borrow the full cost of your course - you can pay for some of it yourself.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the loan is paid</h2>

<p>The money will be paid directly to your college or training organisation once they’ve confirmed you’ve attended the course for 2 weeks.</p>

<h2>The number of loans you can apply for</h2>

<p>You can apply for more 24+ Advanced Learning Loans after you finish your course (up to 4 in total), but:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can only get 1 loan at a time</li>
  <li>you can’t apply for another loan to repeat the same level of a course (eg you can’t get a loan to fund a Level 3 certificate in French when you have previously had a loan to fund a Level 3 certificate in Italian)</li>
</ul></article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>To get a loan you must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>24 or older on the first day of your course (there’s no upper age limit)</li>
  <li>living in the UK on the first day of your course, and have lived in the UK, the Channel islands or the Isle of Man for 3 years immediately before this</li>
  <li>starting your course on or after 1 August 2013</li>
  <li>taking an eligible course that’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/help-and-advice/comparing-qualifications/" title="qualification levels: which courses are level 3 and above">level 3 or above</a> (such as A levels or a higher or advanced apprenticeship)</li>
  <li>studying at a college or training organisation in England approved for public funding</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Getting a loan doesn’t depend on your household income and there’s no credit check.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="how-to-claim"><header><h1>Part 4: How to claim</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll be able to apply online or by post from April 2013 for courses starting between 1 August 2013 and 31 July 2014.</p>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to apply even if your course has already started. You have to apply before it finishes. </p>

<p>It can take up to 5 days to process an application (or 2 to 4 weeks if you apply by post). </p>

<p>You need a <a href="/national-insurance-number" title="Get a National Insurance number">National Insurance number</a> before any money can be paid. You can still apply for a loan before you’ve got a National Insurance number.</p>

<p>You need your passport details or another form of identity to apply - eg your birth certificate. Don’t send your passport.  </p>

</article><article id="further-information"><header><h1>Part 5: Further information</h1>
  </header><p>For more details about 24+ Advanced Learning Loans contact your college or training organisation.</p>

<h2>Paying back your loan</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If your course finishes before 2016, repayments won’t start until April 2016.</p>
</div>

<p>You pay back your loan (plus interest) when you’ve finished your course and start earning more than £21,000 a year. If your income drops below this amount repayments stop.</p>

<p>Each month you pay back 9% of any income over £21,000. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
If you earn £25,000 a year your monthly repayments would be £30.</p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can get independent financial advice from the <a href="http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk" title="Money Advice Service" rel="external">Money Advice Service.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Interest</h2>

<p>You pay interest from the time your first payment is made until you pay your loan back in full.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Income</th>
      <th>Interest rate</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>While you’re studying and until the April after you leave the course</td>
      <td>Rate of inflation (Retail Price Index) plus 3%</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£21,000 or less</td>
      <td>Rate of inflation</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£21,000 to £41,000</td>
      <td>Rate of inflation plus up to 3%</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£41,000 and over</td>
      <td>Rate of inflation plus 3%</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Making repayments</h2>

<p>If you’re an employee your employer will work out your repayments and take them out of your salary with your tax.</p>

<p>If you’re self employed you make repayments as part of your <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment tax return</a>.</p>

<p>You can pay some or all of your loan at any time without an extra charge.</p>

<h2>Leave or change your course</h2>

<p>If you leave or change your course after 2 weeks you’ll have to pay back any money that’s been paid to your college or training provider. </p>

<p>The interest rate will be the rate of inflation. </p>

<p>Speak to your college or training provider to see if they can transfer the loan to another course. </p>

<h2>Access to Higher Education (<abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>If you get a loan to cover tuition fees for an Access to <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> course (eg a course that will prepare you for higher education) and then complete a higher education course, you won’t have to repay the remaining loan for the access course.</p>
