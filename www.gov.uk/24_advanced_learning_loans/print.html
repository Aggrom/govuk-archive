</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The amount you’ll get depends on: </p>

<ul>
<li>the type of course you take</li>
  <li>how much the fees are</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum loan you can get is £300.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t have to borrow the full cost of your course - you can pay for some of it yourself.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the loan is paid</h2>

<p>The money will be paid directly to your college or training organisation once they’ve confirmed you’ve attended the course for 2 weeks.</p>

</article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>

<h2>Paying back your loan</h2>

<p>You don’t have to pay back your loan (plus interest) until you’ve finished your course and start earning more than £21,000 a year.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can get independent financial advice from the <a href="http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk" title="Money Advice Service" rel="external">Money Advice Service.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Applying for another loan</h2>

<p>You can apply for more 24+ Advanced Learning Loans after you finish your course (4 in total), but:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can only get 1 loan at a time</li>
  <li>you can’t apply for another loan to repeat the same level of a course (eg you can’t get a loan to fund a Level 3 certificate in French when you have previously had a loan to fund a Level 3 certificate in Italian)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Access to Higher Education (<abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>If you get a loan to cover tuition fees for an Access to <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> course (eg a course that will prepare you for higher education) and then complete a higher education course, you won’t have to repay the remaining loan for the access course.</p>
