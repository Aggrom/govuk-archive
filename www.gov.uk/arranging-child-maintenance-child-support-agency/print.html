  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Child maintenance is financial support that helps towards a child’s everyday living costs when the parents have separated.</p>

<p>It’s for children who are either:</p>

<ul>
<li>under 16</li>
  <li>16 to 19 and in full-time education (not higher than A-level or equivalent)</li>
</ul>
<p>The parent who doesn’t have day-to-day care of the child pays child maintenance to the parent or person who does. </p>

<p>This person could be a grandparent or guardian as well as a parent. </p>

<p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) can sort child maintenance out for you - they’ll work out how much should be paid, and they can also collect the payments for you.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can use the <a href="/calculate-child-maintenance" title="child maintenance calculator">child maintenance calculator</a> to get an idea of what payments might be.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="how-to-apply"><header><h1>Part 2: How to apply</h1>
  </header><p>You can apply to the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) if you are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the parent the child lives with</li>
  <li>the parent the child doesn’t live with</li>
  <li>a grandparent or other guardian of the child</li>
  <li>a child living in Scotland</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The parent the child doesn’t live with is called the ‘paying parent’. The parent or carer they live with is called the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who can’t use the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You can’t use the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> if the receiving parent or the child lives outside the UK. </p>

<p>If the paying parent lives abroad, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can only help <a href="/child-maintenance-if-one-parent-lives-abroad" title="child maintenance if one parent lives abroad">in certain circumstances</a>. </p>

<h2>What the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can help with</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can help you:</p>

<ul>
<li>find the other parent if you don’t know where they live</li>
  <li>sort out any <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency/disagreements-about-parentage" title="disagreements about parentage">disagreements about parentage</a>

<h2>How to apply for child maintenance</h2>

<p>You can apply for child maintenance by <a rel="external" href="https://www2.dwp.gov.uk/csa/v2/en/setup/apply-by-telephone.asp" title="find your local CSA office">contacting your local <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> office.</a></p>


</article><article id="how-to-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: How to pay</h1>
  </header><p>Child maintenance can be paid:</p>

<ul>
<li>by direct debit - the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) will set this up</li>
  <li>directly from the paying parent’s earnings - the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> sorts this out with their employer</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments are paid into the receiving parent’s bank account.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The ‘receiving parent’ is the parent or carer they live with.</p>
</div>

<h2>Paying child maintenance directly</h2>

<p>When the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> has worked out a child maintenance amount, you can make your own payment arrangements if you both agree. This is called Maintenance Direct. </p>

<p>The easiest way to pay is by standing order - payments go direct from the paying parent’s  bank, building society or Post Office account into the receiving parent’s account. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you or the other parent don’t have a bank, building society or Post Office account and can’t open one, <a href="https://www2.dwp.gov.uk/csa/v2/en/contact/index.asp" title="tell the CSA" rel="external">tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>When payments are made</h2>

<p>If you’re using the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> to collect and pass on payments, they’ll arrange this based on when the paying parent is paid their wages, pension or benefits. </p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www2.dwp.gov.uk/csa/v2/en/contact/index.asp" title="contact the CSA">Contact the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr></a> immediately if you’re a paying parent and having problems paying.</p>

<h3>Collection and payment schedules</h3>

<p>If you’re the paying parent, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will send you a ‘collection schedule’ - this tells you how much you need to pay and when.</p>

<p>If you’re the receiving parent, they’ll send you a ‘payment schedule’ - this tells you how much is due and when it’ll be collected</p>

<p>There’s more information about how child maintenance is collected and paid in the leaflets below.</p>

<h2>Paying off child maintenance debt</h2>

<p>If you’re a paying parent and you’ve missed paying child maintenance you’ll usually be asked to pay the full amount you owe straight away. You can pay:</p>

<ul>
<li>with a credit or debit card</li>
  <li>through your bank</li>
</ul>
<p>In some circumstances, you might be able to agree with the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> to pay the debt in instalments.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency/nonpayment-what-happens" title="how the CSA deals with non-payment">take action</a> if child maintenance isn’t being paid.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="nonpayment-what-happens"><header><h1>Part 4: Non-payment</h1>
  </header><p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) will take action if child maintenance isn’t paid.</p>

<p>When a child maintenance payment is missed, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will contact the parent the child doesn’t live with to:</p>

<ul>
<li>find out why they haven’t paid</li>
  <li>arrange for them to pay what they owe</li>
  <li>warn them about action that might be taken if they don’t pay</li>
</ul>
<p>The parent has a week to respond. If they don’t, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can take action to get the child maintenance owed.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The parent the child doesn’t live with is called the ‘paying parent’. The parent or carer they live with is called the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can do</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can take action immediately if the paying parent pays through the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the paying parent used the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> to calculate child maintenance but pays directly (Maintenance Direct), the receiving parent needs to ask the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> to take action.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can get unpaid child maintenance in 3 different ways.</p>

<h3>Taking money from a paying parent’s earnings or benefits</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can tell the paying parent’s employer how much to take from their wages. The employer must then pass this to the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> - if they don’t, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can take them to court.</p>

<p>If the paying parent gets benefits, a State Pension or War Pension, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can take the amount owed from these payments.</p>

<h3>Taking money from a bank or building society account</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> doesn’t need permission to do this. It can tell the bank or building society to take either:</p>

<ul>
<li>regular payments</li>
  <li>a one-off payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking court action</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can take a paying parent to court over unpaid child maintenance. Things the courts can do include:</p>

<ul>
<li>sending bailiffs (Sheriff Officers in Scotland) to a paying parent’s home to take and sell their belongings to get the child maintenance owed</li>
  <li>sending a paying parent to prison</li>
  <li>collecting money that’s owed to the paying parent by someone else and using this to pay the child maintenance owed</li>
  <li>forcing the sale of a property and using the money to pay the child maintenance owed</li>
</ul>
<p>If a paying parent tries to avoid paying by selling property or transferring it to someone else, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can ask the courts to stop them.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can also ask the courts to reverse any sale or transfer that’s already happened.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> takes action through the courts, the paying parent may have to pay the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>’s legal costs as well as their own.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="disagreements-about-parentage"><header><h1>Part 5: Disagreements about parentage</h1>
  </header><p>If someone denies they’re the parent of a child, the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) will:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask them for evidence proving they’re not the parent</li>
  <li>tell the other parent what’s happened and ask for evidence to prove parentage</li>
</ul>
<p>If the person named as the parent can’t give evidence proving they’re not, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask both parents to take a <a href="dna-tests" title="DNA tests">DNA test</a>
</li>
  <li>ask the courts to make a decision</li>
</ul>
<h2>Presumed parentage</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can presume parentage if the person named as the parent:</p>

<ul>
<li>was married to the child’s mother at any time between the conception and birth of the child (unless the child was adopted)</li>
  <li>is named on the child’s birth certificate (unless the child was adopted)</li>
  <li>has taken a DNA test that shows they’re the parent</li>
  <li>has legally adopted the child</li>
  <li>is named in a court order as the parent when the child was born to a surrogate mother</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> presumes parentage it will work out a child maintenance amount. The person named as the parent has to pay this until they can prove that they’re not the child’s parent.</p>

<h2>Paying child maintenance during a disagreement</h2>

<p>If the child maintenance amount has already been worked out, the person named as the parent has to pay until they can provide evidence that they’re not.</p>

<p>If the amount hasn’t been worked out, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> won’t work it out or ask for payment until the disagreement has been sorted out. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the person is found to be the parent, the amount of child maintenance they have to pay will be back-dated.</p>
</div>

<h2>If the named person proves they’re not the parent</h2>

<p>If this happens the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> may:</p>

<ul>
<li>refund any payments made after the date they first denied they were the parent</li>
  <li>refund the cost of any DNA tests arranged through the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> may also ask the other parent to pay back any child maintenance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Refunds depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="dna-tests"><header><h1>Part 6: DNA tests</h1>
  </header><p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) can use DNA testing to sort out <a href="disagreements-about-parentage" title="disagreements about parentage">disagreements about parentage</a>. </p>

<p>This either:</p>

<ul>
<li>proves 100% that someone isn’t a child’s parent</li>
  <li>shows a 99.9% probability that they are a child’s parent</li>
</ul>
<p>The person named as the parent and the parent the child lives with need to agree to the tests. If the child is 16 or over, they can give their own permission.</p>

<h2>Arranging a test</h2>

<p>This can be done either through:</p>

<ul>
<li>the DNA testing company used by the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> </li>
  <li>a private testing company</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> only accepts the results of a private test if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s been done by <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/paternity-testing/paternity-test" title="approved DNA testing companies">an approved company</a>
</li>
  <li>security arrangements meet acceptable standards</li>
  <li>everyone involved is satisfied that the test was done properly</li>
  <li>the test was based on samples from the person named as the parent, the parent the child lives with and the child</li>
</ul>
<p>DNA testing involves the following steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The DNA testing company sends an information pack to the parent the child lives with and the person named as the parent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person named as the parent chooses a doctor to do the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor gets a testing kit from the testing company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor takes a sample (either from the mouth, or a blood sample).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor sends the samples to the testing company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testing company sends the results to the person named as the parent, the parent the child lives with and the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> - they might also be given to a court as evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test fees</h2>

<p>The person named as the parent has to pay the DNA test fee, which is £252. If they pay when they return their appointment form, they can pay a discounted rate of £187.20.</p>

<p>In some circumstances the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will pay the test fee if the person named as the parent can’t afford to. But if they’re found to be the parent, they’ll have to pay it back.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>These costs can change - <a href="https://www2.dwp.gov.uk/csa/v2/en/contact/index.asp" title="contact the CSA" rel="external">contact the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr></a> to check.</p>
</div>

<h2>After the test</h2>

<p>If the test proves the person is the parent of the child, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will work out how much their payments should be. </p>

<p>Payments will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>child maintenance</li>
  <li>the cost of the DNA test</li>
</ul>
<p>If the test proves the person isn’t the parent, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> may:</p>

<ul>
<li>refund the cost of the test (if it was done through the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>refund any child maintenance payments made after parentage was denied</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> doesn’t pay back any child maintenance that was paid before the person denied they were the parent of the child.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Refunds depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="changes-you-need-to-report"><header><h1>Part 7: Changes you need to report</h1>
  </header><p>There are some changes you have to tell the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) about by law.</p>

<p>What you have to report depends on whether you’re the parent or person the child lives with (the ‘receiving parent’) or the parent the child doesn’t live with (the ‘paying parent’).</p>

<h2>If you’re the paying parent</h2>

<p>You must tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>move house (you must give your new address within 7 days of the moving date)</li>
  <li>start or stop getting benefits</li>
  <li>change your phone number (including mobile number) </li>
  <li>start or stop working for an employer</li>
  <li>start or stop being self-employed</li>
  <li>become unemployed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pay child maintenance through deductions in your earnings and you leave your job, you must also tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>the name and address of your new employer (if any)</li>
  <li>how much you expect to earn</li>
  <li>your new payroll number (if any)</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you’re the receiving parent</h2>

<p>You must tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> if there’s a change to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of children living with you that you get child maintenance for</li>
  <li>the number of nights a child regularly stays overnight with the paying parent</li>
  <li>the number of children that you or your partner get child benefit for</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>a child you get child maintenance for leaves full-time education (below A-level)</li>
  <li>you or any of the children you get child maintenance for no longer live in the UK</li>
  <li>you find out that the paying parent is coming off benefits</li>
  <li>you’re moving house or know that the other parent is</li>
  <li>your phone number (including mobile number) changes</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Either parent should tell the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> if the paying parent’s income changes.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you don’t give the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> the right information</h2>

<p>You could be taken to court and fined up to £1,000 if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t give the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> the information it needs</li>
  <li>give the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> information that you know is false</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to any person or organisation who, by law, must give the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> information, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>employers</li>
  <li>accountants</li>
  <li>either parent</li>
</ul>
<h2>When changes could affect your payments</h2>

<p>Child maintenance payments could be affected by changes to:</p>

<ul>
<li>income </li>
  <li>family circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child maintenance case was opened before March 2003, it’ll be worked out using an old set of rules. Cases opened before March 2003 are called ‘1993 scheme’ cases. Cases opened after March 2003 are ‘2003 scheme’ cases.</p>

<p>Sometimes, changes in your circumstances mean that you’ll move from 1993 scheme rules to 2003 scheme rules.</p>

  </header><p>If the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) makes a mistake in your child maintenance case, this is called ‘maladministration’. </p>

<p>You can sometimes get compensation called ‘special payments’ if this happens. Read the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> leaflet on special payments for more information.</p>

</div>

<h2>Advance payments of child maintenance</h2>

<p>Sometimes <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> maladministration means child maintenance isn’t collected on time. This leads to a delay in the receiving parent getting child maintenance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘receiving parent’ is the parent or carer the child lives with. The ‘paying parent’ is the parent they don’t live with.</p>
</div>

<p>If there’s a delay, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> might make an advance payment to the receiving parent whilst it collects payment from the paying parent.</p>

<h3>When the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> makes advance payments</h3>

<p>This only happens when:</p>

<ul>
<li>there’s clear evidence that <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> maladministration caused the delay</li>
  <li>there’s clear evidence that if maladministration hadn’t happened, the paying parent would have paid or been made to pay</li>
  <li>the amount owed because of maladministration is over £100</li>
  <li>it would take more than 26 weeks for the paying parent to pay the child maintenance that wasn’t collected because of maladministration</li>
  <li>the delay was longer than the time it normally takes to process payments</li>
</ul>
<p>The receiving parent must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have been made to wait longer than normal for their child maintenance </li>
  <li>have shown an interest in progressing their case during the period of the delay, contacting the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> at least every 3 months</li>
  <li>agree that the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can keep the delayed payments once they have been collected from the paying parent</li>
  <li>agree to refund any payments made directly to them by the paying parent instead of their delayed payments</li>
</ul>
<p>The paying parent must:</p>

<ul>
<li>have been paying up until the point of maladministration</li>
  <li>be making regular payments when an application for an advance payment is made</li>
