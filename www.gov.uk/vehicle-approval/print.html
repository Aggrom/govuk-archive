</article><article id="when-you-need-type-approval"><header><h1>Part 2: When you need type approval</h1>
  </header><p>Most motor vehicles and trailers used on the road need type approval. Normally, the manufacturer or importer will take care of this.</p>

<p>However, your vehicle might not have type approval, and you might need to apply for it. Examples of when this might happen include if you’ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/vehicle-registration/kit-cars-and-rebuilds" title="Kit cars and rebuilds">built or rebuilt</a> a vehicle</li>
  <li>
<a href="/vehicle-registration/radically-altered-vehicles" title="Radically altered vehicles">radically altered</a> a vehicle</li>

  <li>
<a href="/importing-vehicles-into-the-uk/mutual-recognition-and-type-approval" title="Importing your vehicle">imported</a> a vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need type approval for:</p>

<ul>
<li>cars and light goods vehicles over 10 years old</li>
  <li>heavy goods vehicles over 25 years old  </li>
</ul>
<p>If your vehicle needs type approval, you must send in proof of this when you apply to <a href="/vehicle-registration" title="Register your vehicle">register it</a>. If you don’t, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) won’t register the vehicle.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If your vehicle fails its approval tests, it can’t be registered.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="individual-vehicle-approval"><header><h1>Part 3: Individual Vehicle Approval</h1>
  </header><h2>Who can use the scheme?</h2>

<p>You can use the Individual Vehicle Approval (<abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>) scheme if you’re making or importing a single vehicle or a very small number of vehicles in the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>passenger cars</li>
  <li>light goods vehicles (under 3,500kg)</li>
  <li>buses and coaches</li>
  <li>medium to heavy sized goods vehicles (more than 3,500kg)</li>
  <li>trailers</li>
  <li>special purpose vehicles, like vehicles specially designed to hold a wheelchair</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t use the normal ‘compulsory’ <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> if your vehicle has been registered before in the UK - you’ll need to use the <a href="voluntary-approval" title="Voluntary approval">voluntary version of the scheme</a> instead.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vehicle identification number</h2>

<p>Your vehicle needs a <a href="/vehicle-registration/vehicle-identification-number" title="Vehicle identification number">vehicle identification number</a> (<abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>) before having an <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> inspection. If it doesn’t have one, apply to your <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/contactus/localoffices/findnear.aspx" title="Find your DVLA local office">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) local office.</a></p>

<h2>Basic and normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are 2 levels of <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> inspection: basic and normal.</p>

<h3>Basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>A basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> involves a visual inspection and other tests to make sure the vehicle meets the necessary standards. You won’t normally need to provide any documentary evidence.</p>

<p>You can apply if you have a passenger car or a light goods vehicle in one of these categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>left-hand drive vehicles</li>
  <li>personal imports</li>
  <li>amateur built vehicles (kit cars)</li>
  <li>rebuilt vehicles</li>
  <li>very low volume production vehicles</li>
  <li>ambulances</li>
  <li>motor caravans</li>
  <li>hearses</li>
  <li>armoured vehicles</li>
  <li>a vehicle manufactured using parts of a registered vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p>For help understanding these categories, download <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/Transport_files/IVA_Information_Guide.pdf" title="Guide to the IVA: VOSA" rel="external"><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide to the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> (PDF, 1.84MB)</a> - annex 1 and 2.</p>
</div>

<h3>Normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you don’t meet the criteria for a basic <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>, you’ll have to apply for a normal <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This involves a more detailed inspection. Vehicles have to meet extra standards and you’ll have to provide documentary evidence of this.</p>

<h2>How to show your vehicle meets <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> standards</h2>

<p>There are several ways to prove your vehicle meets the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> standards (is ‘compliant’). See part 5 of <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>’s guide to the <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>, below, for full details. </p>

</div>

<h2>Model reports</h2>

<p>One way of proving your vehicle is compliant is by showing it’s the same specification as another vehicle (a ‘master vehicle’) that’s been proved compliant. You do this using a model report. </p>

<p>If a model report has already been produced for your exact model of vehicle, you may be able to use it for a fee. <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has a list of <a rel="external" href="http://www.vosa.gov.uk/vosacorp/publications/modelreports/modelreports.htm" title="Download list of model reports and their owners: VOSA">model reports and their owners.</a></p>

<p>Otherwise, you’ll need to pay for your own laboratory tests to be carried out. </p>

<h3>Choosing a test station</h3>

<p>Your vehicle will be inspected by <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> at one of their approved test stations or Privately Owned Test Facilities (POTFs). You should say which one you want to use on your application form.</p>

<h2>Cost of the scheme</h2>

<p>You have to <a href="inspection-fees" title="Inspection fees">pay a fee</a> for the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) to inspect your vehicle.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> will inspect your vehicle at the test location you’ve chosen and will issue an Individual Approval Certificate (<abbr title="Individual Approval Certificate">IAC</abbr>) if it passes.

<p>If your vehicle doesn’t pass its inspection and you’re not satisfied with the decision, you can appeal and have a re-examination carried out by an independent inspector. </p>

<p>You must make your appeal within 14 days of the decision and you’ll have to pay a fee. This will be refunded, either partially or fully, if your appeal is successful.</p>

<p>You mustn’t modify the vehicle before the appeal inspection. </p>

</article><article id="voluntary-approval"><header><h1>Part 8: Voluntary approval</h1>
  </header><p>If your vehicle <strong>hasn’t</strong> been registered before in the UK, use the normal ‘compulsory’ Individual Vehicle Approval (<abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>) or Single Vehicle Approval (<abbr title="Single Vehicle Approval">SVA</abbr>) schemes. </p>

<p>If your vehicle is <strong>already registered</strong> and you need to prove its compliance, use the voluntary version of these schemes.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A taxi licensing authority may need evidence of compliance if your vehicle has been modified since it was originally registered.</p>
</div>

<h2>Choosing which voluntary scheme to use</h2>

<p>Up until 29 April 2012, you can use the voluntary <abbr title="Single Vehicle Approval">SVA</abbr> for special purpose vehicles (eg wheelchair-accessible vehicles). After that date, and for any other vehicle, you need to use the voluntary <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to choose whether to use the standard/enhanced or basic/normal level. The criteria is exactly the same as the compulsory version of the schemes. </p>

<h2>How the voluntary scheme works</h2>

<p>In general, the voluntary and compulsory versions of the <a href="individual-vehicle-approval" title="Individual Vehicle Approval"><abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr> scheme</a> and the <a href="single-vehicle-approval" title="Single Vehicle Approval"><abbr title="Single Vehicle Approval">SVA</abbr> scheme</a> are exactly the same.</p>

<p>The only differences are:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can use the voluntary scheme if your vehicle has already been registered in the UK</li>
  <li>you’ll have to pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on the fee</li>
  <li>for the voluntary <abbr title="Single Vehicle Approval">SVA</abbr> scheme, you’ll have to fill out a different application form</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost of the schemes</h2>

<p>You have to <a href="inspection-fees" title="Inspection fees">pay a fee</a> for the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) to inspect your vehicle. The voluntary versions of the schemes cost the same, except that <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is payable. </p>
