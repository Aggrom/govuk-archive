  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Children must use the right car seat until they reach 135 centimetres tall or age 12. The type of car seat your child needs depends on their weight.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Never carry a child on your lap, or use a single seat belt for 2 passengers whatever their age.</p>
</div>

<p>Only EU-approved baby seats, child car seats or booster cushions can be used in the UK. These have a label showing a capital ‘E’ in a circle. Second hand child seats or boosters must still meet current safety standards - check them thoroughly before accepting and make sure they haven’t been involved in a crash.</p>

<p>Some seats are adjustable and can be used as your child grows - check the seat label.</p>

<h2>Using your child’s car seat in the front seat</h2>

<p>You can use your child’s car seat in the front seat of a vehicle, if it fits. This includes 2-seater cars or convertibles with the top down.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must deactivate any frontal airbags before fitting a rear-facing baby seat.</p>
</div>

<h2>Side-facing seats</h2>

<p>Child car seats must not be used in side-facing seats.</p>

<h2>Vehicles without seat belts</h2>

<p>If your vehicle doesn’t have seat belts, a child over 3 can travel in the back seat without their car seat.</p>

<p>Children under 3 must not travel in cars, vans or goods vehicles without a seat belt or their car seat.</p>

<h2>Cars with integral child-sized seats</h2>

<p>Some cars have their own (integral) child-sized seats that are only suitable for children. If the seat is approved for use instead of a child’s car seat, it will have a label with an ‘E’ in a circle. The label will also show the weight of the child that it’s approved for - usually above 15 kilograms.</p>

<p>If the child-sized seat isn’t approved, your child will need to use their car seat. If their car seat doesn’t fit, your child can’t use the vehicle’s integral child-sized seat.</p>

<h2>Car seats in a seat with only a lap belt</h2>

<p>If a seat only has a lap belt, you’ll still need to fit your child’s car seat. </p>

<p>Most seats can only be used with a belt that has a diagonal strap as well, so in this case you’ll need to get a diagonal belt fitted.</p>

</article><article id="car-seats-for-children-with-disabilities"><header><h1>Part 2: Car seats for children with disabilities</h1>
  </header><p>Normal rules apply for children with disabilities unless a doctor says they’re exempt on medical grounds. However, they may use disabled person’s seat belts or child restraints designed for their needs.</p>

<p>Contact your doctor for more information.</p>

</article><article id="child-car-seats-in-minibuses"><header><h1>Part 3: Child car seats in minibuses</h1>
  </header><p>In minibuses with unladen weight less than 2.54 tonnes, children of 3 and above have to use a child seat if there is one.</p>

<p>It’s not compulsory for the driver or anyone else to provide the child’s car seat.</p>

<p>If there isn’t a child car seat or the ones fitted are unsuitable, then children aged 3 and above must use an adult seat belt. Younger children can travel without a seat belt in this case.</p>

</article><article id="when-a-child-can-travel-without-a-car-seat"><header><h1>Part 4: When a child can travel without a car seat</h1>
  </header><p>There are a few situations when a child can travel without a car seat if one isn’t available.</p>

<h2>Taxis and private hire vehicles (minicabs)</h2>

<p>In a licensed taxi or licensed private hire vehicle (minicab), children aged:</p>

<ul>
<li>under 3 can travel without a child’s car seat or seat belt, but only on the back seat</li>
  <li>3 years or older can travel without a child’s car seat but they must wear an adult seat belt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unexpected but necessary journeys over a short distance</h2>

<p>If the correct child seat isn’t available, a child over 3 years old can use the adult belt for an unexpected but necessary journey over a short distance. This doesn’t apply to a regular school run or planned journey.</p>

<p>You must not take children under 3 in a vehicle without a seat belt or the correct child car seat.</p>

<h2>No room for a 3rd child seat in the back</h2>

<p>If there’s no room for a 3rd child seat in the back seat a 3rd child under the age of 3 can’t travel unless they are in the front seat with the correct child seat.</p>

<p>Children over 3 years can either use the front seat with the correct child seat or sit in the back using an adult belt.</p>
