</div>

</article><article id="having-driver-cpc-through-acquired-rights"><header><h1>Part 3: Having Driver CPC through 'acquired rights'</h1>
  </header><p>You could have the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (<abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>) through ‘acquired rights’ if you’re already a professional lorry, bus or coach driver.</p>

<p>This means that because you’ve already been working as a lorry or bus driver, your experience is counted as the same as taking the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> initial qualification.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll still need to do 35 hours of periodic training every 5 years to keep your Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who has ‘acquired rights’</h2>

<p>You’ll have ‘acquired rights’ if you’re a:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>lorry driver</strong> and got your vocational licence (C, C1, C+E and C1+E) before 10 September 2009</li>
  <li>
<strong>bus or coach driver</strong> and got your vocational licence (D, D1, D+E and D1+E) before 10 September 2008</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You don’t have ‘acquired rights’ if you have a D, D1, D+E or D1+E licence with <strong>‘not for hire or reward’</strong> or <strong>‘101’</strong> on it. You’ll need to pass all 4 parts of the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driver-certificate-of-professional-competence-cpc/the-driver-cpc-initial-qualification" title="The Driver CPC initial qualification">initial qualification</a> to be able to drive professionally.</p>
</div>

<h2>When you need to do periodic training</h2>

<p>If you’ve got your Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> by ‘acquired rights’ you must do 35 hours of periodic training by:</p>

<ul>
<li>9 September 2014 if you’re a <strong>lorry driver</strong>
</li>
  <li>9 September 2013 if you’re a <strong>bus or coach driver</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Driving a larger vehicle and adding trailer entitlements</h2>

<p>Your ‘acquired rights’ don’t allow you to drive a larger vehicle of the same type or drive with a trailer if this isn’t on your vocational licence.</p>

<p>You’ll have to pass the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> part 3 (driving ability) test to do this.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You’d have to take the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> part 3 test with a C+E vehicle combination if your vocational licence was only for a category C vehicle.</p>
</div>

<h2>Driving a different type of vehicle</h2>

<p>Your ‘acquired rights’ only counts for the type of vehicle you’d originally got your vocational licence for. </p>

<p>You’d have to get the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> initial qualification for the other type of vehicle.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>You’d have to get the Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> initial qualification for buses and coaches if you only had ‘acquired rights’ for lorries.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="driver-qualification-card-dqc"><header><h1>Part 4: The driver qualification card (DQC)</h1>
  </header><p>After you’ve passed the initial qualification you’ll get a driver qualification card (<abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr>).</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must carry your <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr> while driving a large goods vehicle or passenger carrying vehicle.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you have ‘acquired rights’</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You won’t get a <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr> if you have your Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (<abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>) through <a href="/driver-certificate-of-professional-competence-cpc/having-driver-cpc-through-acquired-rights" title="‘acquired rights’">‘acquired rights’</a> until you’ve done 35 hours of periodic training.</p>
</div>

<p>Your driving licence is proof of your Driver <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> until you’ve done this.</p>

<p>You don’t need to keep your licence with you, but if asked by the police, you must show it at a later date as proof of your ‘acquired rights’.</p>

<h2>Getting your <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You’ll get your <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr> when you’ve completed either your initial qualification or your 35 hours of periodic training if you have a Great Britain photocard licence. It will be sent to the address on your driving licence.</p>

<h3>If you have a paper licence</h3>

<p>You’ll need to <a href="/exchange-paper-driving-licence-photocard-licence" title="Swap your paper licence for a photocard licence">swap your paper licence for a photocard licence</a> before you can get your <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr>. This is because the <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr> needs a photograph and signature, which are taken from the photocard details.</p>

<h3>If some of your periodic training was done in another EU member state</h3>

<p>You need to write to the Driving Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr>) to apply for your <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr> if you’ve done some of your periodic training in another EU member state.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must have done at least the last 7 hours of your periodic training in the UK to apply to do this.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to include:</p>

<ul>
<li>your UK driving licence number</li>
  <li>your phone number</li>
  <li>the address and dates when you lived in that member state</li>
  <li>the names and addresses of your employers for that time</li>
  <li>the equivalent of your tax reference or national insurance number in the member states you worked in</li>
  <li>a £25 fee to add training taken abroad to your <abbr title="Driver qualification card">DQC</abbr>
