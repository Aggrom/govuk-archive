  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing mobile phones to your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>costs for phones you provide to employees</li>
  <li>reimbursing your employee’s own phone costs</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or deduct and pay tax and National Insurance if both the following apply: </p>

<ul>
<li>you provide your employee with only 1 mobile phone or SIM card </li>
  <li>the phone contract is between you and the supplier</li>
</ul>
<h2>Low-earning employees</h2>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year, you don’t have to report or pay anything if either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the employee has a ‘pay as you go’ phone and you reimburse the cost of business calls</li>
  <li>you pay the supplier directly for a phone that was acquired for business purposes and is only used for business calls</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If telephone expenses aren’t <a href="/mobile-phones-reporting-expenses-and-benefits/whats-exempt" title="What's exempt">exempt</a>, you must report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on them.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can <a href="/apply-for-a-dispensation%20%E2%80%9Capply%20for%20a%20dispensation">apply for a dispensation</a> which means you won’t have to include telephones for employees on your end-of-year reports.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you provide more than one phone to an employee</h2>

<p>One of the phones is exempt from paying and reporting, but any other phones count as <a href="/assets-made-available-to-an-employee-reporting-expenses-and-benefits" title="Assets made available to an employee">assets</a>.</p>

<h2>If your employee arranges the phone but you pay the supplier</h2>

  </header><p>The value to use for reporting or paying National Insurance depends on who arranges and pays for the mobile phone, and whether you cover the cost of personal or business calls.  </p>

<h2>Your employee arranges the phone but you pay the supplier or reimburse them</h2>

<p>The amount to put through payroll is the amount of monthly tariff you reimburse, plus the cost of any private calls above the tariff if you reimburse these as well. </p>

<p>The amount you should report is the cost of any business calls you reimburse that are on top of the monthly tariff. </p>

<h2>Your employee has a ‘pay as you go’ mobile and you pay for business calls</h2>

<p>The value to use is the amount you reimburse or give to the employee as a ‘top up’.</p>
