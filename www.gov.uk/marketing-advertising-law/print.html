  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>All marketing and advertising must be:</p>

  <li>legal</li>
  <li>decent</li>
  <li>truthful</li>
  <li>honest</li>
  <li>socially responsible (not encouraging illegal, unsafe or anti-social behaviour)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="/marketing-advertising-law/regulations-that-affect-advertising" title="regulations that affect advertising">regulations</a> that restrict what advertisers can and can’t do.</p>

<p>As well as the regulations, there are 2 <a href="/marketing-advertising-law/advertising-codes-of-practice" title="advertising codes of practice">advertising codes of practice</a> that you can agree to follow to help you advertise legally.</p>

<p>You must <a href="/marketing-advertising-law/describing-your-product" title="describing your product">describe your product</a> or service accurately.</p>

<h2>Requirements for specific products</h2>

<p>There are also specific requirements that apply to certain sectors, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>food</li>
  <li>alcohol</li>
  <li>beauty products</li>
  <li>environmentally friendly products</li>
  <li>medicines</li>
  <li>tobacco</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can only claim your drink is ‘low in alcohol’ if it contains between 0.5% and 1.2% alcohol by volume.</p>

<li>including false or deceptive messages</li>
  <li>leaving out important information</li>

<h2>Advertising to businesses</h2>

<p>Advertising to businesses is covered by the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations. As well as being accurate and honest, you must not make misleading comparisons with a competitor, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>using a competitor’s logo or trademark or something very similar</li>
  <li>comparing your product with a competitor’s product that’s not the same</li>
</ul>

<h2>Penalties</h2>

<p>If you break the regulations, you could be reported to either a <a href="/find-local-trading-standards-office" title="find your local Trading Standards office">local Trading Standards office</a> or the Office of Fair Trading. You could be fined, prosecuted or imprisoned.</p>

</article><article id="advertising-codes-of-practice"><header><h1>Part 3: Advertising codes of practice</h1>
  </header><p>There are 2 <a rel="external" href="http://www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes.aspx" title="Advertising codes">advertising codes of practice</a> that describe how businesses should advertise.</p>

<p>They cover all kinds of promotional communications, depending where the advert or promotion will appear.</p>

<h2>Non-broadcast media</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.cap.org.uk/The-Codes/CAP-Code.aspx" title="Committee of Advertising Practice code">Committee of Advertising Practice code</a> has rules that cover non-broadcast advertising (eg print, online), sales promotion and direct marketing (eg telesales and email).</p>

<p>The code specifies standards for accuracy and honesty that businesses must stick to, including specific conditions, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>advertising to children</li>
  <li>causing offence</li>
  <li>political advertising</li>
</ul>
<h2>Broadcast media (eg TV, radio)</h2>

<p>You must follow <a rel="external" href="http://www.cap.org.uk/The-Codes/BCAP-Code.aspx" title="BCAP code">broadcast codes</a> that cover issues including taste, decency and product placement.</p>

<p>As well as setting standards about accuracy and honesty businesses must stick to, they also have rules about things like scheduling.</p>

<h3>General broadcasting rules</h3>

<p>You also need to follow rules about taste, decency, product placement etc that apply to all broadcasting.</p>

<p>These are called ‘broadcast codes’. Find out more about them on the <a rel="external" href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broadcast-codes/" title="Broadcast codes">Ofcom website.</a></p>

<h2>Enforcing the rules</h2>

<p>The rules are enforced by the Advertising Standards Authority (<abbr title="Advertising Standards Authority">ASA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks advertising rules have been broken can <a rel="external" href="http://www.asa.org.uk/Consumers/How-to-complain.aspx" title="How to complain">complain to the <abbr title="Advertising Standards Authority">ASA</abbr></a> within 3 months of the advert appearing.</p>

<p>If an advert breaks the rules, it may be withdrawn. If the product doesn’t match the description or the advert breaks the law, you could be prosecuted.</p>


</article><article id="describing-your-product"><header><h1>Part 4: Describing your product</h1>
  </header><p>You must describe your product accurately. This means if you make a claim about your product, you must be able to prove what you say.</p>

<h2>Prices</h2>

<p>Your adverts must describe the actual cost accurately, including any ongoing or associated costs (eg subscription fees) and taxes (eg <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>).</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
A customer pays £50 a product, without being told the price doesn’t include <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. This was not explained in the advert, so the advert is misleading.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="direct-marketing"><header><h1>Part 5: Direct marketing</h1>
  </header><p>You must check if customers want to be contacted by fax, phone, post or email, and give them the chance to object.</p>

<p>When you collect customer details, you must get their permission if you want to send them other offers or promotions.</p>

<p>You must also ask for their permission if you want to share their information with another organisation.</p>

<h2>Letting customers opt out</h2>

<p>Customers have the right to stop their information being used for direct marketing.</p>

<p>You must make it easy to opt out - eg by sending a ‘STOP’ text to a short number, or using an ‘unsubscribe’ link.</p>

<h2>Telesales and fax marketing</h2>

<p>You must say who you are when you make a telesales call, and give your address or phone number if you’re asked for it. The number for customers to call must be a freephone number.</p>

<p>You’re not allowed to send marketing faxes to individuals unless you’ve received their prior permission, but you can send unsolicited faxes to companies.</p>

<p>You must check that you’re not contacting anyone who’s asked not to receive these calls or faxes, using the:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="https://www.tpsmanage.com/" title="Telephone Preference Service">Telephone Preference Service</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/fps/" title="Fax Preference Service">Fax Preference Service</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>It’s illegal to phone or fax someone registered with these services if you don’t have their permission. You can be fined £5,000 for each unsolicited phonecall.</p>
</div>

<h2>Automated calls</h2>

<p>If you want to make automated calls - with pre-recorded phone messages - you must get the permission of the individual or business first.</p>

<h2>Direct mail</h2>

<p>Check that your mailing lists don’t include anyone who’s asked not to receive direct mailing, using the <a rel="external" href="https://corporate.mpsonline.org.uk/index.php/mps/faq" title="about the Mail Preference Service">Mail Preference Service.</a></p>

<h2>Email marketing and text messages</h2>

<p>You’re only allowed to send marketing emails to individual customers if they’ve given you permission.</p>

<p>Emails or text messages must clearly indicate:</p>

<ul>
<li>who you are</li>
  <li>that you’re selling something</li>
  <li>what the promotions are, and any conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>Check that you aren’t sending emails to anyone who’s asked not to receive them, using the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ims-dm.com/cgi/offemaillist.php" title="Email Preference Service">Email Preference Service.</a></p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you buy or rent a mailing list, ask the supplier if you have the right to use it for email marketing.</p>
</div>

<p>Every marketing email you send must give the person the ability to opt out of (or ‘unsubscribe from’) further emails.</p>
