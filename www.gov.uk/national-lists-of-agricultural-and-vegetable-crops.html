<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>New varieties of agricultural and vegetable species must be added to the National Lists before they can be commercially exploited. The National Lists are maintained by the Plant Variety Rights and Seeds Office (<abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr>), which is part of the Food and Environment Research Agency (<abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr>), an executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="national-lists">National Lists</h2>

<p>The National Lists are lists of agricultural crop and vegetable varieties approved for certification and marketing in the UK.</p>

<p>There are two main lists for plant varieties:</p>

<ul>
<li>agricultural</li>
  <li>vegetable</li>
</ul>
<p>The national vegetable list is further divided into varieties:</p>

<ul>
<li>eligible for certification and marketing as standard or certified seed </li>
  <li>that may be marketed as standard seed (the ‘B’ list)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plant varieties covered by the National Lists are included in the guide to National Listing, from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>.</p>

<p>Download the guide to National Listing from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantVarieties/nationalListing/documents/nlGuideSept10.pdf"><abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website (PDF, 232KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="listing-conservation-and-amateur-varieties">Listing conservation and amateur varieties</h3>

<p>If you wish to conserve old vegetable varieties or landraces, and the sustainable use of plant genetic resources, you can apply for National Listing under one of the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>an Agricultural Conservation Variety - ie a landrace or plant variety that is naturally adapted to local and regional conditions and is threatened by genetic erosion</li>
  <li>a Vegetable Conservation Variety - ie a landrace or plant variety which has been traditionally grown in particular localities or regions and is threatened by genetic erosion</li>
  <li>an Amateur Vegetable Variety - ie a plant variety developed for growing under particular conditions with no intrinsic value for commercial crop production and intended specifically for amateur gardeners</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find guidelines for making a National List application for each of the three categories on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantVarieties/nationalListing/index.cfm"><abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-national-lists-affect-farmers-and-growers">How National Lists affect farmers and growers</h3>

<p>All seed grown for commercial marketing in the UK must be officially listed by the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="eligibility-to-apply-for-national-listing">Eligibility to apply for National Listing</h3>

<p>Anyone can apply to have a plant variety included on the relevant National List. However, if Plant Breeders’ Rights (<abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr>) are held for a variety, anyone wanting to market or multiply its seed must get permission from the rights holder.</p>

<p>Download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s UK <abbr title="Plant Breeders' Rights">PBR</abbr> handbook from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264675&amp;id=264676">Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 135KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="legislation">Legislation</h3>

<p>The UK National Lists are based on <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> Council Directives on the marketing of agricultural and vegetable varieties. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> compiles common catalogues of varieties on member states’ National Lists. Varieties on this common catalogue are eligible for certification and marketing throughout the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</p>

<p>For more information about <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> common catalogues, see the page in this guide on ’Plant Varieties and Seeds Gazette and the European Union common catalogue’.</p>

<p>For National List purposes, <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> directives are covered by the Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1997 and the National List Regulations made under that Act.</p>

<h2 id="acceptable-varieties-for-national-lists">Acceptable varieties for National Lists</h2>

<p>To be accepted for the National Lists, an agricultural or vegetable variety must conform to the ‘<abbr title="'distinct, uniform and stable'">DUS</abbr>’ criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>distinct</li>
  <li>sufficiently uniform</li>
  <li>stable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="distinctness">Distinctness</h3>

<p>A distinct plant variety is one that differs in one or more important characteristics from other varieties included in:</p>

<ul>
<li>a National List</li>
  <li>a list of another member state corresponding to a National List</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> common catalogue</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uniformity">Uniformity</h3>

<p>‘Uniformity’ means a variety whose individual plants are ‘similar or genetically identical’ in terms of important characteristics, allowing for ‘very few’ aberrations.</p>

<h3 id="stability">Stability</h3>

<p>Stable plant varieties are those whose essential characteristics remain true to their original description after successive propagations or multiplications.</p>

<h3 id="value-for-cultivation-and-use">Value for cultivation and use</h3>

<p>For agricultural crops to be listed, the variety must also show <abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr> during trials. This means a clear improvement, either for cultivation or regarding the uses made of the crops or products deriving from them.</p>

<p><abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr> trials are not necessary for:</p>

<ul>
<li>vegetables</li>
  <li>grasses not intended for the production of fodder plants</li>
  <li>any plant variety whose seed is to be marketed in another member state, which has already accepted it on to a National List, having regard to its value for cultivation and use</li>
  <li>any variety intended for use only as a component of a final plant variety</li>
</ul>
<p>If you consider that your variety has a special <abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr> merit claim, you must indicate this on the technical questionnaire submitted with your application. Special tests or trials, for which a fee is payable, may be needed to prove the claim.</p>

<h3 id="listing-genetically-modified-gm-and-novel-foods">Listing genetically modified (<abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr>) and novel foods</h3>

<p>Before you can apply to have them included on a National List, <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> plant varieties must be accepted for marketing under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Council Directive 2001/18/<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> on the deliberate release into the environment of <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> organisms. If the variety is intended for food or feed use, it must have been accepted under Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No 1829/2003 on <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> food and feed.</p>

<p>Find out more about applying to have a <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> variety accepted on to the National Lists on the page in this guide on ’Applying for National Lists’.</p>

<p>If any material derived from the variety is intended for use as a food or food ingredient - as defined by Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) 258/97 - that food or food ingredient must be authorised under the novel foods regulation, amended by Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No. 1829/2003.</p>

<h3 id="application-requirements">Application requirements</h3>

<p>If you are applying to have a plant variety listed, you must complete the appropriate <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> forms and technical questionnaire, and pay the administration fee.</p>

<p>Find out more about National Lists application procedures on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantVarieties/nationalListing/index.cfm"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You can nominate an agent to handle your application by completing an Authorisation of Agent form. Once you have appointed an agent, the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> will correspond exclusively with them and take their instructions as if they were your own.</p>

<p>You can also complete a maintainer form, which says who will maintain your variety when it is added to the National List. You do not have to send this form with your application, but it must be submitted before a decision on whether to add a variety to a National List can be proposed.</p>

<h3 id="gm-variety-applications">
<abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> variety applications</h3>

<p>You are legally obliged to tell the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> if you are applying for listing of a <abbr title="Genetically modified">GM</abbr> plant variety - as defined under the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) Council Directive 2001/18/<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before your variety can be tested, you must get at least one of the following types of consent and supply copies with your application:</p>

<ul>
<li>marketing consent - in accordance with Part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990</li>
  <li>part C marketing consent - in accordance with Council Directive 2001/18/<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>consent in accordance with Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No 1829/2003</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="novel-food-variety-applications">Novel food variety applications</h3>

<p>You must inform <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> if you are applying to register a plant variety that can be used as a food or food ingredient, as defined under article 1(2) of Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No. 258/97.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to get all the necessary authorisations and tell <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> of any restrictions imposed that may affect the statutory tests and trials. Copies of any authorisation must be provided with the application form.</p>

<h3 id="conservation-and-amateur-vegetable-varieties-applications">Conservation and amateur vegetable varieties applications</h3>

<p>While not mandatory, you can apply to register certain conservation and vegetable varieties for amateur gardeners. See the page in this guide on ‘what are the National Lists?’.</p>

<h3 id="tests-and-trials">Tests and trials</h3>

<p>Each plant variety entered for inclusion in the National Lists has to undergo trials - normally over at least a two-year period. Herbage trials take a minimum of three years. The purpose of the trials is to decide whether the new variety is distinct, uniform and stable (<abbr title="'distinct, uniform and stable'">DUS</abbr>) and, for agricultural varieties, has a value for cultivation for use (<abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr>). For more information on <abbr title="'distinct, uniform and stable'">DUS</abbr> and <abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr>, see the page in this guide on ‘What varieties can be accepted for National Lists?’.</p>

<p>Testing can be carried out by approved organisations, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>NIAB</li>
  <li>British Society of Plant Breeders (<abbr title="British Society of Plant Breeders">BSPB</abbr>) - for <abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr> trials</li>

<h2 id="names-and-maintenance-of-seed-varieties">Names and maintenance of seed varieties</h2>

<p>If you are applying for an agricultural or seed variety to be included in the UK National Lists, you must satisfy two main requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>the variety must have a unique name</li>
  <li>there must be a designated maintainer of the variety</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="names">Names</h3>

<p>You must propose a name for your candidate variety. If the variety is accepted for listing, the same name will normally be used in all member states of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must not choose a name where:</p>

<ul>
<li>its use is precluded by the prior right of a third party</li>
  <li>there are difficulties regarding recognition or reproduction</li>
  <li>it is identical to, or may be confused with, another variety name</li>
  <li>it is identical to, or may be confused with, other goods</li>
  <li>it is misleading or causes confusion concerning the characteristics of the variety or other features</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposed names for varieties are advertised in the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> Gazette, with three months allowed for objections.</p>

<p>Find out more about the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> Gazette, see the page in this guide on ’The Plant Varieties and Seeds Gazette and the European Union common catalogue’.</p>

<p>Once a variety has been added to a National List or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> common catalogue, it may only be marketed under its registered name.</p>

<p>Download the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) guide to National Listing from the <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=253575&amp;id=253576"><abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 142KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h3>

<p>A variety on a National List needs to be maintained by at least one person according to accepted practices.</p>

<p>The maintainer must have the facilities and services available to enable them to maintain the variety. You must have a maintainer before your variety can be proposed for addition to a National List. You can get a maintainer form from the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Maintainers must keep records of all the generations of the varieties maintained and produce these for inspection on request. The maintainer must also allow authorised officers to inspect or examine any plants or plant material, and provide samples if required.</p>

<p>Anyone can apply to be designated as an additional maintainer of a variety, or to take over the maintenance of a variety if the original maintainer no longer wishes to do so.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-decisions-on-entries-to-the-national-lists">Proposed decisions on entries to the National Lists</h2>

<p>New agricultural or vegetable varieties entered for the National Lists need to go through a series of tests, trials and assessments.</p>

<p>For more information on National Lists trials, see the page in this guide on ’Applying for National Lists’.</p>

<p>Once these tests are complete and all other conditions - such as a unique name and an acceptable maintainer - have been met, the UK National Authorities, represented by the National Lists and Seeds Committee, will make a proposed decision on whether or not to accept the variety onto a National List.</p>

<p>You or your agent will be sent copies of the final <abbr title="'distinct, uniform and stable'">DUS</abbr> and <abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr> reports.</p>

<p>Find out more about the <abbr title="'distinct, uniform and stable'">DUS</abbr> and <abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr> requirements on the page in this guide on ‘What varieties can be accepted for National Lists’.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> will then publish the proposed decision on whether to accept or refuse the variety in its monthly gazette. All test results are then made available to anyone on request.</p>

<p>Find out more about the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> Gazette on the page in this guide on ’The Plant Varieties and Seeds Gazette and the European Union common catalogue’.</p>

<p>Anyone affected by the decision may make representations or apply for a hearing on the proposed decision, normally up to 14 days after its publication in the Gazette.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-additions">Proposed additions</h3>

<p>Varieties will be added to the National List, subject to payment of any award fee if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the UK National Authorities proposes to accept the variety for listing</li>
  <li>no objections are received</li>
  <li>no new evidence is offered that the proposed decision was wrong</li>
</ul>
<p>New listed varieties are published in the Gazette, together with their maintainer(s) and any agents.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-refusals">Proposed refusals</h3>

<p>If the National Authorities proposes to refuse entry of your variety to a National List, it will advise you and publish a notice in the Gazette giving its reasons. Copies of the final <abbr title="'distinct, uniform and stable'">DUS</abbr> and <abbr title="'value for cultivation and use'">VCU</abbr> reports will be sent to you, and made available to others on request.</p>

<p>Anyone may make representations or apply for a hearing, normally up to 14 days after publication of the Gazette. If the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> receives no objections to its decision, it will publish notice of its refusal.</p>

<h3 id="appeals-to-the-plant-varieties-and-seeds-tribunal">Appeals to the Plant Varieties and Seeds Tribunal</h3>

<p>If you disagree with the decision, you can appeal to the Plant Varieties and Seeds Tribunal. In such cases, the National Authorities will suspend its final decision pending the outcome.</p>

<p>The office will then publish a final notice, giving details of appeals received and the suspension of decisions. After it has heard an appeal, the Tribunal will inform the persons concerned and the final decision will be published in the Gazette.</p>

<h2 id="duration-of-plant-variety-listings-renewals-and-deletions">Duration of plant variety listings, renewals and deletions</h2>

<p>If your agricultural or vegetable variety has been approved, it will stay on a National List for ten calendar years. Some species require the payment of an annual fee for each year they remain on the National List.</p>

<p>You must also ensure that you meet all the regulations around listing, such as maintenance of the variety.</p>

<h3 id="ten-year-renewals">Ten-year renewals</h3>

<p>If you or your maintainer wants to continue the listing after the first ten-year period, you should apply to the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> - a department of <abbr title="Food and Environment Research Agency">Fera</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you do not apply for renewal, your variety may be removed from the National List at the end of the ten-year period.</p>

<h3 id="deletion-from-a-national-list">Deletion from a National List</h3>

<p>A maintainer of a variety can give notice to the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> at any time if they no longer intend to maintain a variety. If they are the only maintainer, the <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> will publish a notice in the Gazette, inviting applications from anyone who wishes to maintain the variety. If no applications are received, the variety will be deleted from the National List.</p>

<p>For B-list vegetable varieties only, special provisions apply. Where the only maintainer of a B-list vegetable variety gives notice that they no longer wish to maintain the variety the National Authorities will consider the status of the variety on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, the National Authorities may remove a variety from a National List.</p>

<h3 id="application-records">Application records</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> keeps records of all applications for National Lists and National List awards, and will disclose them on request.</p>

<p>For applications under consideration, <abbr title="Plant Variety Rights Office and Seeds Division">PVS</abbr> records the following information:</p>
