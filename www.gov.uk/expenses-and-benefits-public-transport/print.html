  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer covering your employees’ public transport costs, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>Public transport costs include:</p>

<ul>
<li>season tickets provided for employees  </li>
  <li>season ticket costs reimbursed to employees  </li>
  <li>loans made to employees to buy season tickets  </li>
  <li>contributions to subsidised or free public bus transport  </li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if you’re contributing to subsidised or free public bus transport. You don’t have to pay any tax or National Insurance on these costs.</p>

<p>An example would be when you help finance a bus route that gives your employees free or reduced-rate transport between their homes and work or between workplaces.</p>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the public transport costs aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-public-transport/whats-exempt" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and deduct and pay tax and National Insurance.</p>

<h2>Season tickets provided for employees</h2>

<p>This also includes any other public transport vouchers you provide to employees.</p>

<h2>Season ticket costs reimbursed to employees</h2>

<p>This covers arrangements where your employee buys their own season ticket but you reimburse them or cover their costs with an allowance or salary increase. This counts as earnings, so you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>add the cost to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and Class 1 National Insurance through payroll</li>
</ul>
<h2>Loans made to employees to buy season tickets</h2>

<p>You should treat this as you would any other <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-loans-provided-to-employees" title="loan made to an employee">loan made to an employee</a>.</p>
