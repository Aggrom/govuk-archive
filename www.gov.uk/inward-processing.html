<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Inward Processing (<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>) allows businesses to obtain relief from customs duties and import VAT on goods that are imported from outside the EU to be processed and exported outside the EU. By reducing the cost of imported inputs, <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> places EU businesses on an equal footing with businesses outside the EU. Sole traders, partnerships and incorporated bodies established in any EU country can use <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> subject to authorisation by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. It can be used even if you’re acting as a representative for another body established outside the EU. Without representation, non-EU bodies can only use <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> for non-commercial imports.</p>

<p>This guide shows you how to find out whether <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> applies to you and how to start using it if it does. The guide covers the two types of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>, how to apply for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, and the steps involved in importing, transferring and exporting goods under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>. It also provides links to sources of further help and information.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-types-of-inward-processing">The two types of Inward Processing</h2>

<p><abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> offers relief from customs duties such as Common Agricultural Policy, import VAT, and anti-dumping and countervailing duties. Excise duty is also suspended when goods are entered to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension.</p>

<p><abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> can be provided by either suspension or drawback.</p>

<h3 id="ip-suspension">
<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension</h3>

<p>Customs duties are suspended when the goods in question are first entered into the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> system in the EU - so the duties listed above don’t have to be paid.</p>

<p>Suspension is the most suitable method for traders who will be re-exporting all their imported goods after processing.</p>

<p>Re-exporting isn’t the only valid way of disposing of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods - ‘disposing’ in this context doesn’t mean throwing goods away - see the page on exporting and other ways of disposing of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods.</p>

<p>Conditions apply to using suspension. For example you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>intend to re-export the products produced from the goods entered into suspension</li>
  <li>not issue any documents showing the status of the goods as T2 or free circulation, nor any preference certificates unless specifically allowed under preference rules - to find out more about preference rules, see our guide on importing and exporting using international trade preferences </li>
  <li>send a return to your supervising office within 30 days of the end of your agreed processing period</li>
</ul>
<p>Any goods imported under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension which are subsequently diverted will be subject to payment of all charges suspended at import. They will also be subject to a charge called ‘compensatory interest’. This is to prevent importers using the system to gain a financial benefit by deferring payment of customs duty.</p>

<h3 id="ip-drawback">
<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> drawback</h3>

<p>Under drawback, you pay the customs duties and other charges when the imported goods are first entered into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>. You then claim the duty back when exporting them after processing, or if you have placed them into an alternative customs suspensive regime. Note that import VAT cannot be claimed back in this way, but can be reclaimed as input tax on your VAT return if you are entitled to do so.</p>

<p>Drawback is suitable if you intend to export your goods, but a small proportion (less than 20 per cent of the original importation) might be diverted from <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> to free circulation.</p>

<p>Again, conditions apply. <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> drawback is not suitable in cases where you wish to take advantage of preference agreements between the EU and certain third countries. For further information on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> drawback and preferences, you can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000182&amp;propertyType=document#P249_27017">find information on prohibition of drawback on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>When goods have been exported or otherwise disposed of, you must reclaim your duty within six months using form C&amp;E 813. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000389">Find form C&amp;E 813 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="the-five-types-of-inward-processing-authorisation">The five types of Inward Processing authorisation</h2>

<p>In order to be eligible for duty relief under the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> system, you need to be authorised. </p>

<h3 id="simplified-authorisation">Simplified authorisation</h3>

<p>This allows you to enter goods into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> without making a prior application for authorisation. You use certain customs procedure codes (CPCs) on your customs declaration (C88) Single Administrative Document (SAD) and place certain indicators in Box 44 of your declaration.</p>

<p>The following questions and answers will help you decide whether this is the most appropriate authorisation for you to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is it suitable for? Traders importing goods occasionally to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and carrying out all processing within the UK</li>
  <li>Are there any restrictions? Yes. If you want to import certain goods, or use certain procedures, then you can’t use simplified authorisation. You can see detailed information about the five types of authorisation at section 2.2 when you access Notice 221A on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_025632&amp;propertyType=document#P87_8683"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>
</li>
  <li>Which form should be used to apply? C88 (SAD) - box 37. A Bill of Discharge (C99) is required for each entry. You can download form C99 to detail the disposal of goods entered through <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> from the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_PROD_008126"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 36KB)</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an enquiry that relates to a simplified authorisation, call the NIRU Helpline on Tel 028 6634 4557.</p>

<h3 id="local-authorisation">Local authorisation</h3>

<p>This is the type of authorisation to use if you are a regular user of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The following questions and answers will help you decide whether this is the most appropriate authorisation for you to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is it suitable for? Any trader who meets set conditions is eligible. Local authorisation is particularly suited for frequent <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> traders, and those who use Customs Freight Simplified Procedures</li>
  <li>Are there any restrictions? You should apply at least one month before importing</li>
  <li>Which form should be used to apply? C&amp;E 810. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000380">download form C&amp;E 810 to apply for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 58KB)</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specific-authorisation">Specific authorisation</h3>

<p>There are rules designed to protect EU producers of specified goods in the agri-food sector. You need to show why you can’t use goods produced in the EU rather than importing from outside.</p>

<p>The following questions and answers will help you decide whether this is the most appropriate authorisation for you to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is it suitable for? Importers/processors of specified goods (which are listed in paragraph 2.7 of Notice 221) above an annual threshold of €150,000</li>
  <li>Are there any restrictions? You should apply at least two months in advance</li>
  <li>Which form should be used to apply? Form C&amp;E 810. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000380">download form C&amp;E 810 to apply for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 58KB)</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information on who can apply, see paragraph 2.7 when you access Notice 221 on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000229"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="single-community-authorisation">Single Community authorisation</h3>

<p>The previous three authorisations cover instances in which all processing is carried out in the UK. If the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods are to be processed in more than one member state of the EU (either by one or more businesses), a single Community authorisation can be obtained.</p>

<p>The following questions and answers will help you decide whether this is the most appropriate authorisation for you to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is it suitable for? Businesses importing or receiving goods into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> for processing in more than one EU member state</li>
  <li>Are there any restrictions? You should apply two months in advance of importing - the application must also have been considered in each member state where processing will take place</li>
  <li>Which form should be used to apply? Forms are available from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> National Advice Service Enquiry Line on Tel 0845 010 9000</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integrated-authorisation">Integrated authorisation</h3>

<p>This covers authorisation for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and other customs procedures with economic impact, eg customs warehousing, outward processing relief.</p>

<p>The following questions and answers will help you decide whether this is the most appropriate authorisation for you to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is it suitable for? Traders intending to import goods requiring authorisation for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and other customs procedures</li>
  <li>Are there any restrictions? The authorisation will stipulate how goods are to be transferred between the various procedures it covers</li>
  <li>Which form should be used to apply? It depends on which is the main customs procedure affecting the goods in question. If that is <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>, form C&amp;E 810 should be used. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000380">You can download form C&amp;E 810 to apply for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 58KB)</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retrospective-authorisation">Retrospective authorisation</h3>

<p>This can be issued in exceptional circumstances where you couldn’t have applied in advance - eg if you decide at the last minute to export goods outside the EU because a deal with an EU customer collapses. Applications have to be backed up with supporting evidence, and there is a maximum retrospection period of one year.</p>

<p>You cannot ask for a retrospective authorisation for a simplified authorisation.</p>

<h3 id="responsibilities-of-authorisation-holders">Responsibilities of authorisation holders</h3>

<p>Authorisation holders are responsible for the duties applicable to all goods entered under their authorisation, whether or not they own them. If you name other suppliers, customers or processors in your authorisation, you should make arrangements to indemnify yourself with them, in case there is an ineligible import or export/disposal of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods.</p>

<h2 id="conditions-and-requirements-when-applying-for-inward-processing">Conditions and requirements when applying for Inward Processing</h2>

<p>When applying for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation you need first to consider a number of key factors that are mentioned below.</p>

<h3 id="throughput-period">Throughput period</h3>

<p>This is the period you’ll require to process the goods being entered in <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> - from the date you import or receive them to the date you export or otherwise dispose of them. In general, this period shouldn’t exceed one year, although there are exceptions, eg for the aircraft industry.</p>

<p>If you’re using the simplified authorisation method, there’s a standard throughput period of six months. If you know you’ll need a longer period, inform the National Import Relief Unit (NIRU) in writing at the time of your import declaration at:</p>

<p>National Import Relief Unit<br>
HM Revenue &amp; Customs<br>
Abbey House<br>
Head Street<br>
Enniskillen<br>
County Fermanagh<br>
Northern Ireland<br>
BT74 7LH</p>

<p>You can call NIRU on Tel 028 6632 2298 or send a fax on 028 6632 4018. Alternatively you can contact NIRU via email at <a href="mailto:NIRU@HMRC.gsi.gov.uk">NIRU@<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="compensating-products">Compensating products</h3>

<p>These are all the products resulting from the processing operations you carry out under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>. When you apply for your authorisation, you must identify all the compensating products you’ll obtain following processing. You must distinguish between your main compensating products (MCPs) and secondary compensatory products (SCPs). All products that are a necessary by-product of making your MCPs count as SCPs - they can’t be treated as waste or scrap.</p>

<h3 id="rate-of-yield">Rate of yield</h3>

<p>This is a measure of how many <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> imports you require to produce your processed products - ie your compensating products. You must specify your rate of yield in your application. If your application covers more than one processing operation, then you must include a rate of yield for each operation covered.</p>

<p>In some cases, the rate of yield may be 1:1. For instance, if the processing being carried out is repair work, then you’ll export or dispose of the same number of goods as you import or receive.</p>

<p>EU-wide rules set down standardised rates of yield for certain processing operations on agricultural goods. These rates can be found in Annex 69 of Commission Regulation 2454/93. Download Regulation 2454/93 from the <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2002/l_068/l_06820020312en00110017.pdf">Europa website (PDF, 74KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="the-economic-test">The economic test</h3>

<p>The economic test applies to a range of goods particularly in the agri-food sector and is designed to protect EU producers of those goods. In order to receive <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation for these goods, you’ll need to provide evidence showing why you can’t use EU-produced goods instead. The goods subject to the economic test are listed in paragraph 2.7 of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Notice 221. You can find Notice 221 on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000229"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="record-keeping">Record keeping</h3>

<p>You must keep records relating to all goods that you enter into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>. These must be kept for four years after the goods’ export or disposal.</p>

<p>As well as detailing the nature and quantity of the goods, your records must show:</p>

<ul>
<li>when and where they were entered into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>where all <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods and compensating products are held at any given time</li>
  <li>when and where the goods were re-exported or otherwise disposed of</li>
  <li>what processing is carried out on the goods and where processing takes place</li>
  <li>how the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods can be identified in your compensating products</li>
  <li>production data showing your rate of yield  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="importing-and-entering-goods-using-inward-processing">Importing and entering goods using Inward Processing</h2>

<p>In order to enter goods into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> you need to complete some administrative procedures. Much of this involves filling in certain boxes on form C88 Single Administrative Document (SAD), which needs to be completed for imports in any case. To find out more about the SAD, see our guide on declarations and the Single Administrative Document.</p>

<p>The specific information required on form C88 (SAD) is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>box 31 - a description of the goods being entered to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>box 33 - the eight-digit Combined Nomenclature or Tariff code for the goods</li>
  <li>box 37 - the customs procedure code (CPC) for the type of authorisation you have (see below)</li>
  <li>box 44 - your <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation number and the name and address of your supervising office (simplified authorisation applications require extra information)</li>
  <li>box 47 - this only applies for drawback - if you’re claiming exemption from VAT under a VAT relief, enter “VAX” in the rate column of the VAT tax line</li>
  <li>box 54 - if entries are being made on your behalf by a third party, state whether their representation is direct or indirect</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_001194">find out about CPCs on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You can use a third party, eg an agent or freight forwarder, to handle the entry of your goods into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>. There are two types of third-party representation. With direct representation, you remain solely responsible for any customs debts that may arise. With indirect representation, the third party is jointly liable with you for such debts.</p>

<p>There are other entry considerations for a number of special cases, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Goods subject to preference import licensing - preference can’t be claimed when goods are entered into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>, only if they’re released to free circulation</li>
  <li>Ozone-depleting goods - contact the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> VAT Helpline on Tel 0845 010 9000 as some ozone-depleting goods can’t be entered into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Firearms, ammunition and nuclear material - these can only be entered into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> after an import licence has been obtained from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills: you cannot use a simplified authorisation to import goods listed under Chapter 93 of the Tariff</li>
</ul>
<p>You may transfer goods between <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation holders in other EU countries.</p>

<p>Import VAT has to be accounted for if suspension goods are diverted to free circulation but not if they are transferred to another EU member state. For further guidance on VAT, see section 10.19 of Notice 221 on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000229"><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="equivalence-and-triangulation-explained">Equivalence and triangulation explained</h2>

<p>The equivalence procedure allows you to use identical free-circulation goods instead of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods for processing and re-export. This enables you to hold <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and free-circulation goods in common stock, without having to distinguish which specific goods have been entered into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The following conditions apply to the equivalence procedure:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must supply evidence to show that the free-circulation and <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods are exactly the same</li>
  <li>if any of your imported goods aren’t subsequently re-exported, this can’t be because your customers have differentiated between your <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and free-circulation goods</li>
  <li>if you have applied for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the basis that the goods you need are unavailable within the EU, you can’t use equivalence on EU-produced goods</li>
  <li>if you apply to use triangulation - see below - you must be able to prove you’re the sole beneficiary of using the system</li>
  <li>you need prior authorisation to use equivalence, so it can’t be used with simplified <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisations</li>
</ul>
<p>While the flexibility of ‘common stocking’ - ie keeping <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods with non-<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods - is the main advantage of using equivalence, there are other ways the procedure can be used. For example, a business importing goods for repair could immediately export an identical replacement product that had been repaired previously.</p>

<p>There are a number of variations on the equivalence procedure that you may find useful, depending on your business needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prior export equivalence allows you to export compensating products made from the processing of equivalent free-circulation goods before you have imported your <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods</li>
  <li>Prior import equivalence allows imported <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods to be released to free circulation without the need for duty to be paid, on the basis that equivalent goods will be exported subsequently</li>
  <li>Triangulation is a variation on prior export equivalence. Export of free circulation goods is made by the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation holder, but the subsequent import can be made by another party - the importer doesn’t have to be <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>-authorised, but must be named in the authorisation under which the export and import are being carried out</li>
  <li>Triangulation import/export is a version of prior import equivalence in which the import of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods and the export of equivalent free-circulation goods take place in different member states. The <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> importer uses form INF9 which is then passed on to the exporter who presents it with their export declaration. Form INF9 can be obtained from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> VAT Helpline on Tel 0845 010 9000</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transferring-inward-processing-goods-domestically-and-to-other-eu-countries">Transferring Inward Processing goods domestically and to other EU countries</h2>

<p>Goods that have been entered into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> can be transferred between <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation holders, provided that any authorisation holder receiving the goods has approval to do so. The three main ways that goods can be transferred are between:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation holders in the UK</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation holder in the UK and one in another EU member state</li>
</ul>
<p>View section 4.1 when you <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000229">read Notice 221 on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="transferring-ip-goods-within-the-uk">Transferring <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods within the UK</h3>

<p>There are two main ways of transferring <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods within the UK.</p>

<ul>
<li>The declaration procedure must be used if the receiving authorisation holder doesn’t have Local Clearance Procedure (LCP) approval. The receiver must complete form C88 Single Administrative Document (SAD). For more about the C88 (SAD) see the guide on declarations and the Single Administrative Document</li>
  <li>Simplified procedures allow transfers to be made using commercial documents. Approval from your local <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> authorising office is required. This is often used when <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods are being transferred regularly between the same customer and supplier</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transferring-ip-goods-between-eu-member-states">Transferring <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods between EU member states</h3>

<p>There are four main ways of transferring goods to or from another member state.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using form C88 (SAD): copy 1 is kept by the supplier; copy 4 is sent with the goods to the customer; an additional copy 1 is sent to the customer’s local supervising office. For details of the boxes on the form that need to be completed, see section 28 of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Notice 221. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000229">Find Notice 221 on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>
</li>
  <li>Using simplified procedures: this allows transfer to be made using a two-copy C88 (SAD) or commercial documents. As with intra-UK simplified procedures, approval from your local supervising office is required</li>
  <li>Using a Single Community authorisation: provided the member states involved are agreed, <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods can be transferred between the traders/processors named in a Single Community authorisation using commercial documents. You must maintain accurate records showing where the goods are at all times</li>
  <li>Transfer of drawback goods: drawback goods can be transferred between member states using the Community Transit procedure. Form C88 (SAD) should show the goods’ status as “T1”, and box 1 should include the supplier’s authorisation number and the address of their local supervising office. The form should also be endorsed “<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>/D goods”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transferring-goods-between-ip-and-another-customs-procedure-within-an-integrated-authorisation">Transferring goods between <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and another customs procedure within an integrated authorisation</h3>

<p>No special documentation is required to transfer goods between customs procedures - eg from <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> to customs warehousing within an integrated authorisation. However, you must ensure that your records clearly show the:</p>

<ul>
<li>details of the goods being transferred</li>
  <li>procedures they’re being transferred to and from</li>
  <li>date of the transfer</li>
</ul>
<p>You may see reference to a form INF 1 in the context of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> transfers. This is an information document used to confirm the amount of duty that was suspended when goods were first entered to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>. This is used to calculate the duty owed if the goods are subsequently diverted to free circulation in another member state.</p>

<h2 id="exporting-and-other-ways-of-disposing-of-inward-processing-goods">Exporting and other ways of disposing of Inward Processing goods</h2>

<p>The final stage in the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> process is when goods are re-exported or otherwise disposed of following processing. For drawback goods this is the point at which you can reclaim the duty you paid at import. For suspension goods, this is the point at which your liability ends for the suspended duty.</p>

<h3 id="eligible-disposals">Eligible disposals</h3>

<p>While the clearest way of disposing of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods is to export them from the EU, there’s a wide range of acceptable alternatives that still entitle you to duty relief under the procedure. The main options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exporting directly outside the EU - this can be done using full declaration with form C88 Single Administrative Document (SAD), or using local clearance procedures or simplified declaration procedures. You can check that you are using the correct export code when you <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_001194">find out about customs procedure codes (CPCs) on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>
</li>
  <li>Re-exporting outside the EU via another member state - copy 3 of the C88 (SAD) must be endorsed by UK Customs and sent with the goods to be presented when the goods are being cleared for exit from the EU</li>
  <li>Diverting <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods to free circulation - see the section below ‘Diverting Goods to the EU market’</li>
  <li>Transferring goods to another customs suspension procedure - the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> liability will be discharged once goods have been received and entered into their new customs procedure, but this method still assumes that goods will subsequently be re-exported</li>
  <li>Transferring goods to another <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> authorisation holderitemId=1080139073&amp;r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087337125&amp;r.l3=1079840705&amp;r.l4=1079819583&amp;type=RESOURCES)</li>
  <li>Destruction - under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension this may only be possible under Customs’ supervision</li>
</ul>
<p>Other forms of discharge include export by sea outside of territorial waters, sale to customers who take goods out of the country in their baggage (eg duty-free sales), and supply to duty-free shops. Check if you need to provide a guarantee when transferring goods at section 12.2 when you <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000229">read Notice 221 on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>In order formally to discharge your liability for suspended duty, you need to complete some paperwork. For simplified authorisations use form C99 (a Bill of Discharge) and send it to the National Import Relief Unit; for all other authorisations, use form C&amp;E 812 and send it to your supervising office.</p>

<p>If you are using the drawback system, a repayment claim (form C&amp;E 813) should be submitted to your supervising office. If you have used the simplified authorisation procedures, form C&amp;E 813 should be submitted to the National Import Reliefs Unit (NIRU) at:</p>

<p>National Import Reliefs Unit<br>
HM Revenue &amp; Customs<br>
Abbey House<br>
Head Street<br>
Enniskillen<br>

<p>You can call NIRU Helpline on Tel 028 6634 4557 or send a fax to 028 6632 4018. Alternatively you can contact NIRU via email at <a href="mailto:NIRU@HMRC.gsi.gov.uk">NIRU@<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="diverting-goods-to-the-eu-market">Diverting goods to the EU market</h3>

<p>When you import goods under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>, your intention must be to re-export the processed goods. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> recognises that you may on occasion need to divert either the original imports or the processed goods made from the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> imports to free circulation. Where this occurs, you may request permission to divert a small percentage of the total amount of the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods imported to free circulation. To do so, you will need to submit a Bill of Discharge - Form C&amp;E 812, also known as an <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension return, to request permission to divert <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods to free circulation. You must send the C&amp;E 812 to your supervising office within 30 days of the end of the agreed throughput period.</p>

<p>Once you have received permission to divert the goods, you will need to complete, or arrange to have completed, a C88 entry so that all customs duties and import VAT can be collected. You may also have to pay compensatory interest.</p>

<p>You must either submit individual entries for each diversion or a consolidated entry for each commodity code.</p>

<p>The duty payable will depend on how many of your <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> imports are contained in the products you divert to the EU market. Duty can be calculated in one of three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>quantity method (compensating goods) - where only one kind of product is produced under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>quantity method (import goods) - where more than one kind of product is produced under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>value method - where neither of the quantity methods can be used</li>
</ul>
<p>If you divert goods you received from another member state, your supplier should provide you with a form INF 1 outlining how much duty has been suspended and needs to be paid.</p>

<h2 id="other-inward-processing-procedures">Other Inward Processing procedures</h2>

<p>In certain circumstances you may have to comply with different procedures and bear in mind different considerations.</p>

<h3 id="ip-for-goods-in-customs-warehouses">
<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> for goods in customs warehouses</h3>

<p>If you enter goods into <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension, you can apply to carry out your processing operation in a customs warehouse. Authorisation must be obtained in advance using form C&amp;E 810, and indicating the specific warehouse in which the processing will take place.</p>

<p>Customs warehouses allow for non-EU goods to be held without payment of duty or VAT that would normally be payable. When carrying out <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> operations in these premises, the goods remain physically in the customs warehouse, but your records must clearly show that they’ve been transferred from the warehouse procedure to the <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> procedure.</p>

<h3 id="ip-for-aircraft-construction-and-repair">
<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> for aircraft construction and repair</h3>

<p>Special simplified <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> procedures are available to businesses involved in aircraft construction and repair, or in manufacturing civil aircraft parts, satellites and ground-station equipment. To find out more about <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> for aircraft construction and repair, see section 13 when you <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000229">read Notice 221 on <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="ip-and-the-continental-shelf-outside-territorial-waters">
<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and the continental shelf outside territorial waters</h3>

<p>Special tax and customs rules apply to businesses engaged in oil and gas extraction on the UK continental shelf (UKCS), including simplified procedures for moving <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods to and from the UKCS.</p>

<p>Prior authorisation must be obtained using form C&amp;E 810. Once authorisation has been obtained, you won’t have to declare each movement of <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> goods. Instead, you’ll be able to submit a brief monthly supplementary declaration confirming that all <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> movements have been entered in your records.</p>

<h3 id="ip-and-tax-free-shopping">
<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> and tax-free shopping</h3>

<p>Like all member states, the UK operates a system whereby goods sold by retailers for personal export outside the EU can be zero-rated for VAT. This is called the VAT Retail Export Scheme (RES).</p>

<p>Retailers who use RES can also apply for duty relief under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> for goods that were imported from a non-EU source before being sold for personal export back outside the EU. You can apply using form C&amp;E 810.</p>
