<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Managing and controlling disease is essential for all livestock farmers. The rules for animal identification and movement aim to minimise the risk of disease transmission and maximise the possibility of controlling the spread if it is transmitted.</p>

<p>This guide explains how to register your animals with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>), and the rules on moving your livestock to and from your holding. It also advises how tagging, double tagging and electronic identification can help control diseases.</p>

<h2 id="sheep-and-goat-identification-and-cross-compliance">Sheep and goat identification and cross compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and other direct payments - eg the Environmental Stewardship schemes - you must meet all relevant cross compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental conditions">GAECs</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> require farmers to protect habitats and wildlife, manage their soil and water, control chemical use and prevent animal disease. They also specify rules on animal health, welfare and identification.</p>

<h3 id="smr-8---sheep-and-goat-identification">SMR 8 - Sheep and goat identification</h3>

<p>The aim of these requirements is to maintain a system for the identification and registration of sheep and goats that helps with their traceability, especially in the event of a disease outbreak. They apply to you if you keep sheep and goats.</p>

<p>SMR 8 specifies what you must do about sheep and goat identification and keeping on-farm records. See the pages in this guide on identification of sheep and goats, recording and reporting sheep and goat movements, and holding register for sheep and goats.</p>

<p>You must not alter, obliterate or deface any means of identification attached to an animal. But you may apply additional management information, as long as this doesn’t affect the legibility of the UK flock mark or UK individual ID number.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/f55897de470c4b0d802573aa00549a50/%24FILE/SMR%208%202012%20v1.0.pdf">Download SMR 8 - sheep and goat identification from the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website (PDF, 916K)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sheep-and-goat-registration">Sheep and goat registration</h2>

<p>Since the foot and mouth disease outbreak, there are new rules to improve the identification and tracing of sheep and goats.</p>

<p>This is an important part of disease control because animals may have a disease before they show any symptoms. If they are moved at this stage, they will carry the disease with them and spread it. The rules for animal identification and movement aim to improve traceability and minimise the possibility of spreading disease.</p>

<p>For more information on registering your sheep and goats for disease control, see the guide on disease prevention.</p>

<h3 id="rules-for-buying-sheep-and-goats">Rules for buying sheep and goats</h3>

<p>You must know the health status of any animals before buying them.</p>

<p>You need to apply to the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) for a County Parish Holding (<abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr>) number for the land where you will keep the livestock. You must do this before you move any livestock to your holding. The <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number is for administration purposes and makes it easier to trace livestock owners in event of disease outbreak. You can call the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Helpline on 0845 603 7777.</p>

<p>Once you have your <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr>, you can move the sheep and goats to your farm under the conditions of the general licence for the movement of sheep and goats. You will need to report their movement on form AML1. For more information, see the page in this guide on sheep and goat welfare in transport.</p>

<p>You must be registered with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> even if you only keep one sheep or goat. You must register that you keep sheep and or goats with your local Animal Health Office (<abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>) within 30 days of sheep and or goats arriving on your holding. If you have not registered, you must do so immediately. To register your sheep or goats with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, contact your <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> and give your <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> as a reference.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> will send you a registration document containing your personal details, <abbr title="Country Parish Holding">CPH</abbr> number and a unique <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> flock/herd mark. The flock/herd mark is detailed on the eartags you use to identify animals and identifies where animals are born. It is kept on a national database which is available to inspectors for rapid tracing. For more information on registering and tracking animals, <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/movements/sheep/">read the identification guidance for sheep and goats on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="identification-of-sheep-and-goats">Identification of sheep and goats</h2>

<p>You must identify sheep and goats born or first identified after 31 December 2009 within:</p>

<ul>
<li>six months of birth if housed overnight</li>
  <li>nine months of birth if not housed overnight</li>
  <li>when they move off the holding of birth if this is sooner</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have to apply two identifiers, both bearing the same unique number. For sheep, one must be electronic.</p>

<p>The electronic identification (<abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr>) identifier you use must meet certain standards in order to be used for <abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr> purposes.</p>

<h3 id="exemption-from-double-identification-for-sheep-and-goats-intended-for-slaughter">Exemption from double identification for sheep and goats intended for slaughter</h3>

<p>You do not have to double identify sheep and goats identified for slaughter within 12 months of birth.</p>

<p>Instead, you can apply to these animals a single slaughter batch tag - this can be electronic if you wish.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-what-type-ofidentifier-to-use">How to choose what type of identifier to use</h3>

<p>There are many brands of tag for sheep and goats, to suit various breeds, sizes and ages of the animal. You can also choose to use a bolus or electronic pastern tag instead of an electronic eartag. You also have the option of using a tattoo or a non electronic pastern. These different types of identification can however only be used in certain combinations, for more information <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/2011/03/26/sheep-goats-guidance-pb13327/">read the guidance for keepers in England: Rules for identifying sheep and goats from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/A9E79C55F16DB6CC8025765B004F77D5">Find details of approved identifiers on the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="eartags-how-to-fit">Eartags: how to fit</h3>

<p>Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for fitting eartags. When you apply an electronic eartag you should apply it to the sheep’s left ear (as viewed from behind the animal). If you are single tagging an animal, ie one which is intended for slaughter, you can choose to apply an electronic slaughter tag.</p>

<p>A skilled stockman should fit the tags in cool weather - if possible - to reduce ‘fly strike’ and other possible infections. You should always take measures to prevent or reduce fly strike when tagging.</p>

<p>You should apply all tags hygienically. The animal’s ear, the tag, applicator and the area where you are tagging all need to be clean.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local Animal Health Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="tattoos">Tattoos</h3>

<p>The animal’s tattoo should contain the same information - in the same format - as the <abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr> identifier or in the case of goats the conventional match up eartag. The full information number can be divided between ears. You should tattoo the animal well before the mark needs to be identified - eg at a sale - as the tattoo cannot be read for a few days after it has been made. The tattooist must be properly trained and competent.</p>

<h3 id="animal-welfare-and-how-to-prevent-disease-transmission">Animal welfare and how to prevent disease transmission</h3>

<p>You should be aware of methods of disease prevention and follow these as closely as possible.</p>

<p>For more information on animal welfare and preventing disease transmission, see the guides on disease prevention and sheep and goat welfare.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-record-and-report-sheep-and-goat-movements">How to record and report sheep and goat movements</h2>

<p>Sheep and goat movements need to be recorded and reported.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-hold-registers-for-sheep-and-goats">How to hold registers for sheep and goats</h3>

<p>You must keep individual records of sheep and goats born or identified after 31 December 2009 in a holding register.</p>

<p>You can record numbers either manually or electronically.</p>

<p>You can have individual animal details recorded at approved central recording points, ie markets or abattoirs, instead of by keepers as the animals leave the holding.</p>

<h3 id="movement-documents-for-sheep-and-goats">Movement documents for sheep and goats</h3>

<p>Batch records continue for slaughter animals.</p>

<p>You will have to individually record sheep and goats born after 31 December 2009 on a movement document from 1 January 2011.</p>

<p>You will have to individually record older animals - ie those born before 31 December 2009 - from 31 December 2014 unless they are moving to slaughter.</p>

<h3 id="central-point-recording-centres">Central Point Recording Centres</h3>

<p>Central Point Recording Centres (<abbr title="Central Point Recording Centres">CPRCs</abbr>) allow for individual animal information of electronically identified sheep and goats to be read on behalf of keepers sending sheep and goats to approved reading points, such as markets and abattoirs. Because of this, many keepers will not have to purchase electronic reading equipment. For more information <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/2011/03/26/sheep-goats-guidance-pb13327/">read guidance for keepers in England: Rules for identifying sheep and goats on <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="electronic-identification-cost">Electronic identification: cost</h3>

<p>The cost of <abbr title="electronic identification">EID</abbr> tags and readers will vary according to the complexity of the tagging process. It should come down as it becomes more common. The average price of a basic reader is around £450-£550.</p>

<h3 id="what-equipment-you-will-need">What equipment you will need</h3>

<p>The minimum will be the application of an electronic eartag (where appropriate).</p>

<p>Many individual farmers will not need to purchase electronic equipment. They can read and record animal details manually if they choose or alternatively can send animals to an approved central recording points (ie markets/abattoirs) who will read individual animal numbers of the keepers behalf, instead of keepers having to read individual numbers as animals leave the holding.</p>

<h2 id="holding-register-for-sheep-and-goats">Holding register for sheep and goats</h2>

<p>All sheep and goat keepers in the UK are required to keep a holding register on their farm. You should record the following information in the holding register:</p>

<ul>
<li>your holding details</li>
  <li>tag replacements</li>
  <li>all sheep and goat movements on and off your holding</li>
  <li>date of identification and deaths</li>
  <li>annual count of animals on your holding as at 1 December each year</li>
  <li>individual records of sheep and goats born or identified after 31 December 2009</li>
</ul>
<p>You can record numbers either manually or electronically.</p>

<p>You can have individual animal details recorded at approved central recording points, ie markets or abattoirs, instead of by keepers as the animals leave the holding. If you choose this option you must include the individual animal information in your holding register within 48 hours of the animals departing your holding.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/2011/03/27/holding-register-pb13281/">Find the blank flock register on <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s website</a>.</p>

<p>You can keep the register on paper or electronically as a book, file or spreadsheet. You must record the information in the same format and order as in <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s downloadable register.</p>

<p>You need a separate holding register for each different holding if you keep sheep and goats in different holdings.</p>

<h2 id="sheep-and-goat-welfare-in-transport">Sheep and goat welfare in transport</h2>

<p>When moving animals, you must transport them in a way that won’t cause them injury or unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>Whilst <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules apply to all live, vertebrate animals transported for economic reasons, more stringent elements apply to the transport of farm livestock, such as sheep and goats.</p>

<p>When transporting livestock, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>plan journeys thoroughly and keep the duration to a minimum</li>
  <li>ensure the animals are fit to travel and check them regularlyensure vehicle loading and unloading facilities are constructed and maintained to avoid injury and suffering</li>
  <li>ensure those handling animals are competent and don’t use violence or any methods likely to cause fear, injury or suffering</li>
  <li>provide sufficient floor space and height allowance</li>
  <li>provide water, feed and rest as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal welfare during transportation.</p>

<h3 id="fitness-for-travel">Fitness for travel</h3>

<p>It’s illegal to transport an animal that’s considered unfit for travel. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>new-born mammals where the navel has not completely healed</li>
  <li>heavily pregnant females - where more than 90 per cent of the expected gestation period has passed</li>
  <li>females who have given birth during the previous seven days</li>
  <li>sick or injured animals where moving them would cause additional suffering - unless instructed by a vet</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264364&amp;id=264374">Download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s guidance on whether animals are fit to travel from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 247K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>

<p>Local authorities have primary responsibility for enforcing the rules to protect animals during transportation. Veterinary inspectors from Animal Health also have powers to ensure transporters are following the rules.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> collects information about any transporters caught breaking the law from local authorities, Animal Health and authorities abroad. This information is used when deciding whether to grant, suspend or cancel transporter authorisation.</p>

<p>Anyone transporting pigs over 65 kilometres must hold a certificate of competence.</p>

<p>You must also thoroughly clean and disinfect any vehicle you use to transport your sheep and goats.</p>

<p>You will need to complete four copies of an AML 1 movement document when you move sheep and goats. The recipient of the animals must send the white copy of the completed AML 1 form to their local authority within three days of the move. The other three copies are for the animals’ recipient, the haulier and the departure farmer.</p>

<p>Once you move sheep and goats onto your holding, you must not move another animal off the holding for six days. There are exemptions to this rule and they are covered by the ‘movement standstill rule’. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264614&amp;id=264616">Download <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s information on the movement standstill rule and exemptions from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 54K)</a>.</p>

<p>You must keep movement documents for three years after the move.</p>

<p>See the page on cross compliance, good practice and duty of care to sheep and goats in the guide on sheep and goat welfare.</p>

<h3 id="welfare-at-market-and-shows">Welfare at market and shows</h3>

<p>There is general and specific legislation covering the welfare of animals at markets and shows - in particular Welfare of Animals at Markets Order 1990.</p>

<p>These specify that owners and keepers must provide animals with a suitable environment, good diet, the opportunity to ‘act normally’, sufficient housing, and protection from pain, injury, suffering and disease.</p>

<p>All animal owners are also responsible for the health and welfare of their animals and therefore need to understand and provide for their physical and welfare needs. They have a duty of care towards the animal and must recognise the signs of illness or disease. They also have a responsibility to be vigilant, report any suspicion of disease and maintain good disease prevention and control practice, including compliance with regulations.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on farmed animal welfare at shows and markets.</p>
