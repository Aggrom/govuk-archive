<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (<abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr>) Regulations affect businesses that are involved with electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>). This includes manufacturers, importers, exporters and businesses that re-brand goods.</p>

<p>The regulations limit the use of hazardous substances such as lead and cadmium in the manufacture of new <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> placed on the market anywhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>This guide explains the main requirements of the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations, who they affect and how they are enforced.</p>

<h2 id="businesses-affected-by-the-rohs-regulations">Businesses affected by the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations could affect your business if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>manufacture <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>import new equipment into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>export new equipment to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States</li>
  <li>rebrand electrical and electronic goods that have been produced by other businesses</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="equipment-covered-by-rohs">Equipment covered by <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The types of equipment covered by the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>large household appliances, eg fridges, radiators and air conditioning appliances</li>
  <li>small household appliances, eg sewing machines, toasters and clocks</li>
  <li>IT and telecommunications equipment, eg computers and their accessories, calculators and phones</li>
  <li>consumer equipment, eg TVs, radios and musical instruments</li>
  <li>lighting equipment, eg lamps and luminaires</li>
  <li>electrical and electronic tools, eg drills, welding equipment and lawnmowers</li>
  <li>toys, leisure and sports equipment, eg electric train sets, video games and slot machines</li>
  <li>automatic dispensers, eg drinks, food and money dispensers</li>
</ul>
<p>The regulations only apply to equipment with a voltage of up to 1,000 volts AC or 1,500 volts DC.</p>

<p>If you put goods covered by <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> onto the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market, they must not contain more than the allowed levels of certain hazardous substances. </p>

<p>A new <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Directive will be published in the summer of 2011. This will introduce new categories into the scope of the Directive and will place new requirements on all products within scope for CE marking and conformity assessment procedures. However the Directive will not come into effect in the UK until 2013 and there will be a staged introduction for the new products coming into scope.</p>

<h3 id="equipment-not-covered-by-rohs">Equipment not covered by <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr>

<p><abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations currently do not apply to some equipment, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>large-scale, stationary industrial tools</li>
  <li>the reuse of <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> placed on the market before 1 July 2006</li>
  <li>spare parts for the repair, capacity expansion and upgrade of equipment placed on the market before 1 July 2006</li>
  <li>certain specific uses of hazardous substances, such as mercury in certain types of lamps, lead in cathode ray tubes and lead in crystal and ceramic electronic (piezoelectronic) devices</li>
  <li>medical devices including radiotherapy equipment, dialysis equipment and specialist medical freezers and refrigerators</li>

<h2 id="how-to-comply-with-the-rohs-regulations">How to comply with the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations</h2>

<p>If you manufacture, import, export or rebrand goods covered by the Restriction of the Use of Certain <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations you must ensure they do not contain more than a permitted level of certain hazardous substances.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations place limits on the concentrations of:</p>

<ul>
<li>lead</li>
  <li>cadmium</li>
  <li>mercury</li>
  <li>hexavalent chromium</li>
  <li>polybrominated biphenyls</li>
  <li>polybrominated diphenyl ethers</li>
</ul>
<p>Your business must be able to demonstrate that any <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> that it places on the European Union market does not contain more than the maximum concentration of these substances. This is 0.01 per cent or 1,000 parts per million by weight of homogeneous material for cadmium and 0.1 per cent by weight of homogeneous material for the other five substances.</p>

<p>A homogeneous material is one that cannot be separated into different materials. For example, a plastic that forms part of a device’s case would be homogeneous if it consisted of only one type of plastic. A copper wire is not a homogeneous material as it consists of the wire itself, and its plastic cover. As the wire has two distinct components, each of these must comply with the maximum levels of hazardous substances permitted under the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<p>You must keep technical records for at least four years after a product is placed on the market. These should clearly demonstrate that your <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> complies fully with the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<p>You should design your equipment so that its impact on the environment is kept to a minimum, particularly at the end of its useful life. This can also help you to comply with legal requirements and to cut your costs. See the guide on how to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/advantages-of-designing-efficient-electrical-equipment">design efficient <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3 id="rohs-labelling">
<abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> labelling</h3>

<p>Under the current <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations, there is no official symbol to show that the <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> you manufacture, import, export or rebrand complies with <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr>. However, it is good practice to label your <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> to show that it is <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> compliant. This helps when it is recycled.</p>

<p>Many products are labelled as lead-free but this does not necessarily mean that they are <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> compliant. If in doubt, you should always check with your supplier.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-rohs-regulations-are-enforced">How the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations are enforced</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> is the UK’s enforcement authority for the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> enforces the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> Regulations by initially requesting evidence that the products you manufacture or place on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market comply fully with the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> requirements. It can do this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>buying your products and testing them for compliance</li>
  <li>inspecting your business processes to ensure that you are complying with <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> requirements</li>
  <li>requesting information about your products or processes that must be supplied within 28 days of the request being made</li>
</ul>
<p>You must keep documentation that shows your <abbr title="electrical and electronic equipment">EEE</abbr> is <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> compliant for at least four years after placing your products on the market.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Measurement Office">NMO</abbr> can issue enforcement notices requiring you to remove from sale any products that fail its tests.</p>

<p>If you can’t provide the correct documentation or don’t remove products from sale that don’t comply with <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> you could be fined.</p>

However, the business wanted to go beyond compliance and look at how they design and manufacture their products to further reduce costs and lower the negative impact on the environment when they are disposed of.</p>

<p>Savawatt identified a number of areas where they could improve their electronic products:</p>

<ul>
<li>redesign the electronics from analogue to digital for greater efficiency</li>
  <li>redesign to ensure compliance with <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> and <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> requirements</li>
  <li>reduce the use of materials and components</li>
  <li>simplify the design for easier assembly and disassembly</li>
</ul>
<p>One example of cost savings was from the redesign of the company’s three-phase unit. After the redesign, an approximate saving of £12 per unit was achieved. Overall, a cost saving of £18,000 was made over an 18-month period.</p>

<p>To ensure they complied with the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> and <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations, Savawatt also moved to lead-free solder in the production process. They also replaced brominated flame retardants with other materials that could be reused and recycled.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-benefits-were">What the benefits were</h3>

<p>Savawatt achieved total savings of around £16,000 per year by redesigning its products to reduce waste and use of hazardous substances. The simplified and lighter designs also reduced assembly times and improved recycling.</p>

<p>The redesign enabled Savawatt to comply with their obligations under the <abbr title="Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment">RoHS</abbr> and <abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>
