<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this guide is to explain the UK’s requirements for businesses involved in the holding and movement of excise goods.</p>

<p>It provides an overview of the procedures that apply if you intend to receive or dispatch excise goods that are moving within the UK, throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or to and from non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries. It covers the movement of both duty-suspended and duty-paid excise goods and gives guidance on what you need to do and where you can find further information.</p>

<h2 id="moving-excise-goods-in-duty-suspension">Moving excise goods in duty-suspension</h2>

<p>When excise goods are moving within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in excise duty-suspension, the movement must take place between persons and premises that have been approved for that purpose by the competent authorities in the member state where they are based.</p>

<p>Excise goods may only be moved in excise duty-suspension once they are in ‘free circulation’. This applies to goods that have been wholly produced in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or goods that have been imported into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and have been released to free circulation on completion of all import formalities and payment of any customs duties.</p>

<h3 id="movement-guarantees">Movement guarantees</h3>

<p>Generally, excise goods that are moving within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in excise duty-suspension must be covered by financial security in the form of a movement guarantee. It is the consignor’s responsibility to ensure that a valid movement guarantee is in place, with detail of the guarantee recorded on the appropriate movement documentation prior to the goods being dispatched in duty-suspension.</p>

<h2 id="excise-movement-and-control-system">Excise Movement and Control System</h2>

<p>All duty-suspended movements of excise goods taking place within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must be recorded on the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>) unless the goods are allowed to move under simplified procedures. <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> captures and processes the information about the movement online, validates the data entered and allows real time notification of the dispatch and receipt of duty-suspended excise goods.</p>

<p><abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> allows anyone who is approved to receive or dispatch excise goods in duty-suspension to exchange messages online with their <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trading partners about specific consignments and other movement information.</p>

<h3 id="registering-and-enrolling-for-emcs-using-the-hm-revenue--customs-hmrc-online-service">Registering and enrolling for <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> using the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) online service</h3>

<p>UK consignors and consignees of duty-suspended excise goods can use the free <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> service on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website or use a commercial software package or other in-house option.</p>

<p>Read about <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/emcs/index.htm#6"><abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> options available on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>If you are not already registered and enrolled to use other <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Online Services you will need to do so before you can use <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will need an Excise ID number, also referred to as the ‘Excise Registration Number’. Your Excise ID number is quoted on the letter of approval or certificate of registration that approves you to dispatch and/or receive excise goods under duty-suspension arrangements. This number is also held on the System for the Exchange of Excise Data (<abbr title="System for the Exchange of Excise Data">SEED</abbr>), which is the database used by <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> to validate your approval.</p>

<p>Read about <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/emcs/seed-on-europa.htm"><abbr title="System for the Exchange of Excise Data">SEED</abbr> and the Excise ID number on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Once you have your Excise ID number, the action you will need to take to register and enrol for <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> will depend on whether you are a new or existing user of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Online Services.</p>

<h3 id="dispatching-goods-using-emcs">Dispatching goods using <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you dispatch duty-suspended excise goods using <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, as the consignor you will need to complete and submit a message known as an electronic administrative document (<abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>) through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> before the movement takes place. Once the detail entered on the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> has been validated, <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> generates a unique Administrative Reference Code (ARC) for that particular movement. As the ARC is required to travel with the goods, you must provide the person accompanying the goods (for example, the driver of the vehicle transporting the goods) with a printed version of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or any other commercial document on which the ARC is clearly stated.</p>

<p>If you receive duty-suspended goods that are dispatched under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> procedures, you will need to access <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> in order to receive notification about the expected consignment. Once the goods arrive, you should check the consignment against the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> and then complete and submit a report of receipt through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>. If you discover shortages or surpluses on receipt, you should record this detail on the report of receipt. The report of receipt should be submitted through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> no later than five business days after the goods are received.</p>

<h3 id="procedures-to-use-when-emcs-is-not-available">Procedures to use when <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> is not available</h3>

<p>If <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> is not available, there are special procedures, known as ‘fallback procedures’, which should be followed to allow consignments of excise goods to continue to move under duty-suspension arrangements.</p>

<p>The UK’s fallback procedures allow UK consignors to dispatch or change the destination of duty-suspended excise goods when <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> is not available.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> is not available for a UK consignee to submit the report of receipt, they must wait for <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> to become available before doing so.</p>

<p>Read about <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/emcs/fallback-recovery.htm"><abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> fallback procedures on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<h3 id="movements-of-duty-suspended-excise-goods-wholly-within-the-uk">Movements of duty-suspended excise goods wholly within the UK</h3>

<p><abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> must also be used for duty-suspended movements of excise goods taking place wholly within the UK except for those involving energy products or where simplified procedures apply.</p>

<p>When energy products are moving within the UK in excise duty-suspension, they must be accompanied by a document known as a W8 or a commercial equivalent.</p>

<p>Read about <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000041&amp;propertyType=document#P671_100159">moving duty-suspended energy products within the UK in Notice 179 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="the-uk-simplified-procedures">The UK simplified procedures</h3>

<p>Simplified procedures allow certain duty-suspended movements taking place wholly within the UK to be accompanied by alternative movement documentation instead of under cover of an <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> generated through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>. This applies to the following duty-suspended movements.</p>

<p>Movements of alcoholic liquors taking place between UK premises that are registered or approved for the production or storage of alcohol products, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>ownership of the alcoholic liquor must remain with its producer during the movement unless the approved person operating the premises and the producer are both members of the same VAT group</li>
  <li>in cases where a movement guarantee is required, the alcoholic liquor must be accompanied by a W8 or commercial equivalent</li>
  <li>in cases where no movement guarantee is required, the alcoholic liquor must be accompanied by a commercial document containing certain required information</li>
</ul>
<p>Movements of tobacco products taking place between UK premises that are registered or approved for the production or storage of tobacco, where the following conditions apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>ownership of the tobacco product must remain with its manufacturer during the movement</li>
  <li>the tobacco product must be accompanied by a commercial document containing certain required information</li>
</ul>
<p>Movements of alcoholic liquors or tobacco products from UK registered premises or an excise warehouse to a place in the UK from where the goods will leave the territory of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for direct export, subject to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>the occupier of the premises must be authorised to use Local Clearance Procedures</li>
  <li>a full customs export declaration must be made</li>
  <li>in cases where a movement guarantee is required, the export declaration must indicate the person providing the guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for direct exports from the UK, consignees receiving alcoholic liquors or tobacco products under the simplified procedures must complete and return a certificate of receipt to the consignor no later than five business days after receiving the goods.</p>

<h2 id="storing-excise-goods-in-duty-suspension-in-the-uk">Storing excise goods in duty-suspension in the UK</h2>

<h3 id="the-excise-warehousing-regime">The excise warehousing regime</h3>

<p>Excise goods that are in free circulation can only be stored in excise duty-suspension whilst in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> if they are held in approved premises known as tax warehouses. If you are based in the UK and intend to receive, store and dispatch excise goods in duty-suspension, you will need to have your premises approved as an excise warehouse, which is a specific type of tax warehouse. As the operator of the excise warehouse, you will also need to be approved as an authorised warehousekeeper.</p>

<p>An excise warehouse is any place of security approved by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> where goods liable for excise duty can be stored without payment of the duty for such periods and subject to such conditions as they see fit. Excise duty is suspended whilst goods are held in an excise warehouse but you must get permission from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if you intend to store duty-suspended and duty-paid goods in the same premises.</p>

<p>The three categories of excise goods that can be held in an excise warehouse in duty-suspension are:</p>

<h3 id="the-different-types-of-excise-warehouse-approval">The different types of excise warehouse approval</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will consider applications for the following types of excise warehouse approval, subject to certain conditions.</p>

<h3 id="general-storage-and-distribution-warehouses">General storage and distribution warehouses</h3>

<p>These are premises used for the general storage and dispatch of alcohol and tobacco goods in duty-suspension. In order for these premises to be considered for approval, they must meet one of the following minimum throughput levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>a minimum potential duty liability of £500,000 on the average monthly stockholding of duty-suspended excise goods</li>
  <li>a duty liability of at least £2 million on an annual throughput of duty-suspended excise goods</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trade-facility-warehouses">Trade facility warehouses</h3>

<p>These are premises where excise goods can be stored in duty-suspension for one of the following purposes:
* the maturation of spirits produced at an associated distillery
* goods which will not bear UK excise duty, for example, goods for export, goods used in pharmaceuticals, goods used in foodstuffs, goods to be removed for use as ship or aircraft stores
* performing an allowable operation on the goods
* any other purpose allowed by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr></p>

<p>Trade facility warehouses do not have to meet the minimum throughput levels of a general storage and distribution warehouse, but approval will be restricted to the specific trade need applied for, for example, the warehouse approval may be limited to the storage of spirits for bottling.</p>

<h3 id="motor-and-heating-fuels-warehouses">Motor and heating fuels warehouses</h3>

<p>These are premises where mineral (hydrocarbon) oil, biofuels and special energy products may be stored in duty-suspension.</p>

<p>These warehouses are approved for a specific purpose and specified products, and are normally required to provide a minimum of one million litres bulk storage capacity. Further details about the conditions and requirements can be found in Notice 179.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000041&amp;propertyType=document">Read about motor and heating fuels warehouses in Notice 179 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<h3 id="general-conditions-of-approval-for-excise-warehouses">General conditions of approval for excise warehouses</h3>

<p>The general conditions of approval that excise warehouses must meet are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the premises must be covered by a financial security in the form of a premises guarantee provided by the authorised warehousekeeper (if needed)</li>
  <li>they must be physically secure</li>
  <li>they must allow <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> staff safe access to all approved areas and duty-suspended stock</li>
  <li>they must have systems in place which correctly fulfil the obligations placed by Notices 179, 196 and 197</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> also applies ‘fit and proper’ tests to all approved warehouses, monitoring them regularly to ensure that they remain suitable for continued approval.</p>

<h3 id="who-can-store-goods-in-an-excise-warehouse">Who can store goods in an excise warehouse?</h3>

<p>If you own excise goods and you want to store them in duty-suspension, you will need to be approved by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in order to deposit those goods in an excise warehouse.</p>

<p>If you are a UK-based owner of excise goods, you will need to be approved by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> as a registered owner. If you are an overseas owner without a fixed UK address, you will need to appoint someone who is approved by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> as a duty representative to act on your behalf.</p>

<p>In general, only the warehousekeeper of the warehouse concerned, a registered owner, or an overseas owner with a duty representative acting on their behalf can deposit goods in an excise warehouse.</p>

<p>Owners wishing to deposit their goods in an excise warehouse do not need to be registered by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, or appoint a duty representative, if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the owner of the goods is also the authorised warehousekeeper for the excise warehouse where the goods are to be stored</li>
  <li>the owner of the goods is not a revenue trader</li>
  <li>the goods are not classed as ‘relevant goods’, in other words, the goods being warehoused are either wine or made-wine, certain energy products or goods that are being warehoused for export for duty drawback purposes</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> requires financial security (in the form of a guarantee) relating to the storage of excise goods in an excise warehouse and the movement of excise goods from an excise warehouse in duty-suspension. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will provide a guarantee form for completion by a bank or other approved guarantor who undertakes to pay money to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in the event of an irregularity occurring which is covered by the guarantee.</p>

<p>Premises security is intended to cover the potential duty liability on the duty-suspended stock in the excise warehouse and should normally be provided by the authorised warehousekeeper. The level of guarantee required varies depending on the potential duty on the warehouse’s month-end stockholding - from zero where the potential duty is less than £100,000, up to £1 million where the potential duty exceeds £100 million.</p>

<p>However, new general storage and distribution warehouses are normally required to provide a minimum premises guarantee level of £250,000.</p>

<p>Movement security is intended to cover the potential duty liability on the excise goods being dispatched from the warehouse in duty-suspension and must be provided by the dispatching warehousekeeper, the last owner of the goods whilst warehoused or the transporter. The level of guarantee required is based on the potential duty on an average week’s movements. The minimum level of security for movement guarantees is normally £20,000, otherwise, it varies from 25% of any potential duty less than £1 million, up to a flat guarantee of £1 million where the potential duty exceeds £100 million.</p>

<p>When receiving goods, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that your premises are approved to receive that type of goods</li>
  <li>ensure that the owner, or their duty representative, is entitled to deposit the goods</li>
  <li>place the goods in your warehouse without delay</li>
  <li>enter the goods into your stock account records ensuring that all goods are adequately marked and identifiable in the warehouse</li>
  <li>check all consignments have arrived intact</li>
  <li>investigate any irregularities or indications of interference</li>
  <li>discharge the movement by providing a report of receipt under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> procedures, or by endorsing and returning the certificate of receipt required for movements under simplified procedures, within the specified time limits</li>

<p>As an authorised warehousekeeper, if you are receiving excise goods that have been imported from a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country and the intention is to store those goods free of all duties, you must hold both an excise warehouse and customs warehouse approval for your premises.</p>

<p>If the person importing the goods wishes to suspend the excise duty only, they must arrange for the goods to be placed in an approved excise warehouse. However, this can only be done once the excise goods have been released to free circulation on completion of all import formalities and payment of any customs duties.</p>

<p>The excise duty-suspended movement from the place where the goods are released to free circulation, for example a port or airport in the UK, to the excise warehouse must be carried out by someone who is approved as a Registered Consignor.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will only approve the import agent for the goods or the authorised warehousekeeper receiving the goods from the place of release for free circulation as a Registered Consignor. If either of these persons wishes to apply for approval, they must complete and submit from EX72, and form EXCISE 102 in the case of a partnership.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-in-duty-paid-excise-goods">Dealing in duty-paid excise goods</h2>

<p>If you intend to import into the UK, or arrange the importation of, excise goods that are duty-paid, or released for consumption, in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state for a commercial purpose, the goods will be liable to excise duty in the UK. There are three different ways in which duty-paid excise goods can be imported into the UK for a commercial purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li>the standard UK duty-paid scheme for unregistered commercial importers</li>
  <li>the Registered Commercial Importer scheme</li>
  <li>distance selling arrangements for sales to private individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless the goods are being dispatched under distance selling arrangements, movements of duty-paid excise goods between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states must be covered by a three-part document known as a Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document (<abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="the-standard-duty-paid-scheme">The standard duty-paid scheme</h3>

<p>You do not need to be registered with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to use this scheme. However, before commercially importing any duty-paid excise goods, you should notify <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> by submitting a form HM4 at least 15 working days in advance of the intended date of each dispatch. You must secure the UK excise duty that is due on the goods by submitting your payment, in the form of a banker’s draft, postal order or cheque, along with the HM4. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will return the HM4 to you, endorsed with a unique reference number for that particular consignment.</p>

<p>Your supplier should not dispatch the goods until you have notified them of the unique reference number, which should then accompany the goods along with a completed <abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr>. Under the standard scheme, the goods can only be delivered to your business premises, as stated on the HM4.</p>

<p>You must inform <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> of any changes to the information you have supplied as soon as they occur, and certainly before the goods arrive in the UK. You must notify <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> as soon as you receive the goods and then, within four working days, return the HM4 form to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> along with a copy of the receipted <abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr> and, if appropriate, payment for any outstanding duty or VAT.</p>

<h3 id="the-registered-commercial-importer-scheme">The Registered Commercial Importer Scheme</h3>

<p>This scheme allows you to import duty-paid excise goods into the UK and defer payment of the duty using your own or someone else’s duty deferment account. Under this arrangement the duty is guaranteed by the duty deferment guarantee.</p>

<p>Apart from the difference in the duty payment method and the ability to have the goods delivered to other business addresses, the same procedures apply to Registered Commercial Importers as to those traders using the standard duty-paid scheme.</p>

<p>If you wish to apply for approval as a Registered Commercial Importer, you will need to meet certain criteria, for example, you must have a place of business in the UK and be able to demonstrate a business need and suitability to be a Registered Commercial Importer.</p>

<p>You should apply for approval by completing and submitting form HM3. You will have to provide a <abbr title="Deferment Approval Number">DAN</abbr> on the HM3 - this can be your own or someone else’s. If you intend to use someone else’s, you will also need to submit a completed form HM8 for each deferment account you intend to use.</p>

<h3 id="distance-selling-of-excise-goods">Distance selling of excise goods</h3>

<p>Distance selling takes place when a trader in one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state supplies goods to a private individual in another member state and the vendor (seller) is responsible, directly or indirectly, for delivery of the goods. Distance selling includes mail order and internet sales.</p>

<p>When excise goods are being supplied under distance selling arrangements, they must be taken from duty-paid stock. The vendor is liable to pay the excise duty and VAT of the member state of destination at the time of delivery. The excise duty must be guaranteed to the satisfaction of the fiscal authority of destination before the goods are dispatched.</p>

<p>In the UK, it is a tax representative approved by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, who guarantees to pay the excise duty on the vendor’s behalf. Following the dispatch, the tax representative must account for and pay the full amount of excise duty and VAT due on the goods sent by the vendor.</p>

<p>When making distance sales to the UK, it is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure that a UK Tax Representative is appointed.</p>

<p>UK Tax Representatives are traders who are approved and registered in the UK to account for excise duty on distance sales to private individuals in the UK on behalf of vendors in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.</p>

<p>If you wish to apply for approval as a UK Tax Representative, you must have a place of business in the UK and you must have your own deferment account in place as you will need to use it to account for the duty. You are not permitted to use anyone else’s deferment account to account for the duty on distance sales.</p>

<p>You should apply for approval by completing and submitting form HM9.</p>

<p>The requirement to submit an HM4 for each import of duty-paid excise goods also applies to UK Tax Representatives.</p>

<p>If you’re a UK vendor supplying excise goods to private individuals in other member states under distance selling arrangements, you will be responsible for paying the excise duty and VAT in the member state of destination. You should find out from the authorities in that member state how you must do this, including whether you will need to appoint a Tax Representative in that member state.</p>

<p>Although there is no requirement for any official documentation to accompany excise goods moving under distance selling arrangements, it is advisable that commercial documentation accompanies the consignment showing details of the tax representative in the member State of destination who is to account for the duty.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> suppliers should also be aware of the rules about registering for VAT when making distance sales to other member states including the UK.</p>

<h2 id="uk-duty-stamps-and-fiscal-marks">UK Duty Stamps and fiscal marks</h2>

<p>The UK Duty Stamps Scheme applies to bottles of spirits, wine or made wine with alcohol by volume (ABV) strength of 30 per cent or more, contained in bottles of 35 centilitres or above, for consumption in the UK.</p>

<p>Each bottle must bear a duty stamp indicating that excise duty has either been paid, or is due to be paid, before it is released onto the UK market. Stamps are available either as a freestanding product-specific stamp or a design which can be incorporated into the bottle’s back label.</p>

<p>You need to register with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to obtain duty stamps, unless you are a Temporary Registered Consignee or using the standard UK duty-paid scheme as an unregistered Commercial Importer, in which case you should order stamps direct from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. To register for duty stamps, you will need to complete and submit form DS1.</p>

<p>You can authorise someone to affix stamps on your behalf, or acquire and affix stamps for other businesses such as owners of goods in a warehouse. Owners of goods may register in their own right but they can only obtain the label stamp design.</p>

<p>If you are a Tax Representative, any product you receive must be stamped before the goods arrive in the UK. It is an offence for retailers, wholesalers and transporters, to hold transport or deal in unstamped stock.</p>

<h2 id="excise-duty-drawback">Excise duty drawback</h2>

<p>Excise duty drawback is a refund of UK excise duty. Drawback is paid to eligible claimants, providing certain conditions are met, when UK duty-paid excise goods have not and will not be consumed in the UK because they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>dispatched to another member state (under cover of a <abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr> or as distance sales)</li>
  <li>exported outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (in accordance with export procedures)</li>
  <li>warehoused for export</li>
  <li>destroyed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can claim drawback within three years of paying the excise duty if your duty-paid goods are removed from the UK or destroyed in accordance with the conditions of drawback laid down in the relevant <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Notices.</p>

<p>When you send UK duty-paid goods to another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will only grant drawback when you can provide evidence that the duty has been paid and collected in the receiving member state. Please note that duty-paid alcoholic drinks can no longer be ‘warehoused for export’ as a way of claiming drawback. However, you may continue to claim drawback on such goods using direct dispatch or export arrangements subject to the relevant conditions being met.</p>

<p>If you want to apply for drawback, it’s important you keep all the necessary commercial documentation to support your claim. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> have the right to examine your records. You may also have to allow <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to verify the destruction of your goods, or examine them before they are exported or dispatched. You and your goods must be eligible in order to claim drawback and you must follow the correct claim procedures when making your claim.</p>

<p>Your claim for drawback must normally be submitted at least two business days before the goods are exported or destroyed. You can inform <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> of your plans by completing and submitting form EX75 - Notice of intention to claim drawback.</p>

<p>Please note that bottles of spirits, wine or made-wine bearing duty stamps are not eligible goods for the purposes of drawback. If you want to make a drawback claim you must first obliterate the duty stamp.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can only claim drawback on tobacco products that have been fiscally marked, provided the fiscal mark is obliterated to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>You can also claim drawback on oils that are loaded into a ship or aircraft for use as stores on a foreign voyage or flight.</p>

<p>If you export goods by post from your premises, in addition to completing an export declaration, you must also complete form C&amp;E 132. You must label each package with form C&amp;E 83A and make sure you complete an International Customs Declaration (available from the Post Office) to go with it. You can use your own equivalent of form C&amp;E 132, provided each parcel has its own unique identification number.</p>
