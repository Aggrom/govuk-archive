<h2 id="the-defence-recovery-capability">The Defence Recovery Capability</h2>

<p>This Ministry of Defence (MOD)-led initiative is managed in partnership with <a rel="external" href="http://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/defence-recovery-capability.html" title="Help for Heroes' information on Defence Recovery Capability">Help for Heroes</a> and  <a rel="external" href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/can-we-help/defence-recovery-capability" title="The Royal British Legion's information on Personnel Recovery Centres">The Royal British Legion</a>. It is designed to ensure wounded, injured and sick service personnel receive coordinated support.</p>

<p>Each person who comes under the Defence Recovery Capability is assigned a personnel recovery officer who works with them to create a tailored individual recovery plan which enables them to focus on their outcome: either their return to duty or transition to civilian life.</p>

<p>The individual recovery plan incorporates all aspects of an individual’s recovery including medical, welfare, housing, education, re-skilling, work placements and employment opportunities. It will also ensure that individuals have the access to the particular support needed at each stage of recovery, whether that support is provided by the MOD, the NHS, the charitable sector or other key delivery partners to drive recovery forward.</p>

<h2 id="defencepersonnel-recovery-centres">Defence/personnel recovery centres</h2>

<p>Experience shows that injured personnel find a military environment conducive to the best possible recovery. Recovery centres are managed by the Army on behalf of defence. They offer a residential capacity to those wounded, injured and sick personnel from across the Armed Forces undergoing recovery as well as providing facilities for day attendees; they are not hospitals, rehabilitation or physiotherapy centres. Individuals assigned to a recovery centre must be self-medicating and independently mobile.</p>

<p>The centres are being established in major garrisons in the UK and Sennelager, Germany where they are able to take advantage of the full range of welfare, medical, rehabilitation, education and resettlement facilities.</p>

<p>The recovery centres will be open to serving wounded, injured and sick personnel of the Armed Forces and veterans on a case-by-case priority basis. The centres have been designed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a military environment where wounded, injured and sick personnel can recover</li>
  <li>facilitate and conduct recovery courses and activities in support of individual recovery plans</li>
  <li>offer a secure base/ sick at home address/ spiritual home for wounded, injured and sick personnel throughout the duration of their recovery</li>
  <li>act as a launch point for other recovery activities (Battle Back activities, Graduated Return to Work programmes, work placements, Mandatory Army Training Tests, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recovery-centre-locations">Recovery centre locations</h2>

<p>The following centres are managed by the Army on behalf of defence:</p>

<ul>

<h3 id="tedworth-house-prc-tidworth">Tedworth House <abbr title="Personnel Recovery Centre">PRC</abbr>, Tidworth</h3>

<p>Tedworth House is a stately home on the edge of the garrison town of Tidworth. MOD has owned it since 1897 when it was acquired along with the training area of Salisbury Plain. In 2011 it was leased to Help for Heroes. Extensive restoration work began immediately and phase one of the personnel recovery centre opened in June 2011 with 26 bedrooms for residents and additional facilities for day visitors. </p>

<p>Tedworth House operating costs are funded by Help for Heroes with a significant contribution from their principal partner The Royal British Legion. Help for Heroes has committed to fund and lead the delivery of the project.</p>

<p>Tedworth House will be able to provide residential accommodation for up to 56 people and have the capacity for a further 30 day attendees in autumn 2012. Currently residential capacity is for 42 personnel.</p>

<p>Its facilities include the creation of new accommodation wings, the Phoenix Centre - a state of the art sports complex including a Swimex and Skiplex - a wellbeing therapy centre and social areas. They’re open to veterans on a needs basis.</p>

<p>Tedworth House will also have a support hub offering a ‘one stop shop’ of advice and support for residents, veterans and their families with access to the expertise of welfare agencies, service charities and organisations including guidance on money, health, housing and social issues.</p>

<h3 id="chavasse-vc-house-prc">Chavasse VC House <abbr title="Personnel Recovery Centre">PRC</abbr>
