</header><article id="why-pay-voluntary-contributions"><header><h1>Part 1: Why pay voluntary contributions</h1>
  </header><p>You need 30 years of National Insurance contributions to get a full <a href="/state-pension#what-youll-get" title="basic State Pension">State Pension</a> when you retire.</p>

<p>If you don’t have 30 years of contributions you can pay voluntary contributions to fill or avoid gaps in your National Insurance record.</p>

<p>You may have gaps because:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re ill and and not working and don’t get any benefits </li>
  <li>you’re unemployed and don’t get any benefits </li>
  <li>you live abroad and don’t have to pay National Insurance </li>
  <li>you’re self employed making a profit under £5,595 and don’t have to pay National Insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>To get bereavement benefits you need to pay 39 years of National Insurance contributions for women and 44 years for men.</p>

<h2>Check your National Insurance record</h2>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/NIStatement?dept-name=&amp;sub-dept-name=&amp;location=40&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" title="apply for a National Insurance statement">apply for a National Insurance statement</a> from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) to check if your record has gaps.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/spptv5_en.dsb" title="state pension profiler">State Pension profiler</a> estimates your qualifying years and likely pension.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>When you get close to State Pension age <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> sends you a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/volcontr/gapletter.htm" title="gap letter." rel="external">gap letter.</a> This will tell you how much of a gap you have and how you can pay.</p>
</div>

<h2>Decide if you want to pay voluntary contributions</h2>
<p>You may want to pay voluntary contributions because:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re close to State Pension age and don’t have 30 years of contributions </li>
  <li>you have gaps in your National Insurance record and want to fill them </li>
  <li>you know you won’t be able to pay 30 years of contributions during your working life and want to avoid gaps (more years for bereavement benefits)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you have to be <a href="who-can-pay-voluntary-contributions" title="Who can pay voluntary contributions">eligible to pay voluntary contributions.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> has more information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/volcontr/toppingup.htm" title="Deciding if you want to pay voluntary contributions">deciding if you want to pay voluntary contributions.</a></p>

<h2>How to pay</h2>

<p>You fill gaps by paying your Class 3 contributions as one lump sum. </p>

<p>To avoid gaps you can set up regular payments for Class 2 or Class 3 over a longer period. You can do this by monthly direct debit or by paying quarterly bills from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you’re self employed or live abroad and choose to pay Class 2 you stop your payments when you make a profit of more than £5,595 a year or you return to the UK.</p>
