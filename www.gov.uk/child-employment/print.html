  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="minimum-ages-children-can-work"><header><h1>Part 1: Minimum ages children can work</h1>
  </header><h2>Part-time work</h2>

<p>The youngest age a child can work part-time is 13, except children involved in areas like:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>television</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>theatre</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>modelling</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Children working in these areas will need a <a href="/child-employment/performance-licences-for-children" title="performance licences for children">performance licence</a>.</p>

<h2>Full-time work</h2>

<p>Children can only start full-time work after the last Friday in June of the academic year when they turn 16. This is the minimum school leaving age. </p>

<p>After a child has reached the minimum school leaving age they can work up to a maximum of 40 hours a week.</p>

<p>School-aged children are not entitled to the National Minimum Wage. Young workers aged 16 to 17 are entitled to at least £3.68/hr.</p>

<p>Once someone reaches 18, adult <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="Employment contracts and conditions">employment rights and rules</a> then apply.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From the summer of 2013, a young person must do some part-time education or training until they’re 17.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="performance-licences-for-children"><header><h1>Part 2: Performance licences for children</h1>
  </header><p>Performance licences are issued by the local council.</p>

<p>Before giving a child a performance licence the council will talk to the headteacher of the child’s school. This is to make sure the child’s education won’t suffer if they work in TV, theatre or modelling.</p>

<p>Performance producers can <a href="/apply-for-performance-licence" title="apply for a performance  licence">apply for a performance licence</a> online.</p>

<h2>Chaperones</h2>

<p>A child taking part in a performance - including TV, film, theatre, paid sporting activities or modelling - has to have a chaperone with them. </p>

<p>You can find out about the <a href="/chaperone-service-child-actors" title="find out about the chaperone service for child actors">chaperone service for child actors</a> from your local council.</p>

</article><article id="restrictions-on-child-employment"><header><h1>Part 3: Restrictions on child employment</h1>
  </header><p>There are several restrictions on when and where children are allowed to work.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>without having a 2-week break from any work during the school holidays in each calendar year</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are also special rules which only apply during term times and school holiday times.</p>
</div>

<h2>Local rules on the types of work children can do</h2>

</article><article id="local-council-rules-for-child-employment-permits"><header><h1>Part 4: Local council rules for child employment permits</h1>
  </header><p>Most local councils say that businesses intending to employ school-aged children must apply for a child employment permit before they can be employed.</p>

<p>If a child is working without a child employment permit, there’s a risk that the employer won’t be insured against  accidents involving the child.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Children don’t need a work permit for work experience arranged by their school.</p>
</div>

<p>Employers should contact their <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local council’s</a> education department or education welfare service to find out if a child employment permit is needed.</p>
