  </header><p>When someone dies there are 3 things you must do in the first few days:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Get a medical certificate - you’ll get this from a doctor (GP or at a hospital) and you need one to register the death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register the death within 5 days of the death - you’ll then get the documents you need for the funeral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrange the funeral - you can use a funeral director or do it yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</article><article id="register-the-death"><header><h1>Part 2: Register the death</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If the death has been <a href="/after-a-death/when-a-death-is-reported-to-a-coroner" title="when a death is reported to a coroner">reported to a coroner</a> you can’t register the death until the coroner gives permission.</p>
</div>

<p>Who can register the death, the documents you’ll need and documents you’ll get depend on the circumstances of the death. Use the <a href="/register-a-death" title="register a death tool">register a death tool</a> to find out what you need to do.</p>


</article><article id="when-a-death-is-reported-to-a-coroner"><header><h1>Part 3: When a death is reported to a coroner</h1>
  </header><p>A doctor may report the death to a coroner if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the cause of death is unknown</li>
  <li>the death was violent or unnatural</li>
  <li>the death was sudden and unexplained</li>
  <li>the person who died was not visited by a medical practitioner during their final illness</li>
  <li>the medical certificate isn’t available </li>
  <li>the person who died wasn’t seen by the doctor who signed the medical certificate within 14 days before death or after they died </li>
  <li>the death occurred during an operation or before the person came out of anaesthetic </li>
  <li>the medical certificate suggests the death may have been caused by an industrial disease or industrial poisoning</li>
</ul>
<p>The coroner may decide that the cause of death is clear. In this case:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The doctor signs a medical certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You take the medical certificate to the registrar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coroner issues a certificate to the registrar stating a post-mortem isn’t needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Post-mortems</h2>
<p>To find out how the person died, the coroner may decide a post-mortem is needed. This can be done either in a hospital or mortuary.</p>

<p>You can’t object to a coroner’s post-mortem - but if you’ve asked the coroner must tell you (and the person’s GP) when and where the examination will take place.</p>

<p>After the post-mortem:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The coroner will release the body for a funeral once they have completed the post-mortem examinations and no further examinations are needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the body is released with no inquest, the coroner will send a form (‘Pink Form - form 100B’) to the registrar stating the cause of death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the body is to be cremated, the coroner will also send a ‘Certificate of Coroner - form Cremation 6’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>If the coroner decides to hold an inquest</h2>
<p>A coroner must hold an inquest if the cause of death is still unknown, or if the person: </p>

<ul>
<li>possibly died a violent or unnatural death</li>
  <li>died in prison or police custody</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t register the death until after the inquest. The coroner is responsible for sending the relevant paperwork to the registrar.</p>

<p>The death can’t be registered until after the inquest, but the coroner can give you a certificate to prove the person is dead. When the inquest is over the coroner will tell the registrar what to put in the register.</p>


</article><article id="arrange-the-funeral"><header><h1>Part 4: Arrange the funeral</h1>
  </header><p>The funeral can usually only take place after the death has been registered.</p>

<h2>Funeral directors</h2>
<p>Most people use a funeral director.</p>

<p>Get more than one quote to compare costs. You should choose a funeral director who’s a member of either:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.nafd.org.uk/funeral-advice/funeral-advice-home.aspx" title="National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD)">National Association of Funeral Directors</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.saif.org.uk/website/index.html" title="Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors">Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both organisations have codes of practice and have to give you a price list when asked.</p>

<p>Some local councils run their own <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=671&amp;LGIL=8&amp;ServiceName=Find%20out%20about%20a%20council%20funeral" title="find out about a council funeral">funeral services</a> - eg non-religious burials.</p>

<h2>Arranging the funeral yourself</h2>

<p>To arrange a funeral yourself, contact the Cemeteries and Crematorium Department of your local council.</p>

<h2>Funeral costs</h2>
<p>Funeral costs can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>funeral director fees</li>
  <li>things the funeral director pays for on your behalf (called ‘disbursements’) - eg a newspaper announcement about the death</li>
  <li>local authority burial fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Often funeral directors list all these costs in their quote.</p>

<h3>Paying for a funeral</h3>
<p>The funeral can be paid:</p>

<ul>
<li>by you or other family members or friends</li>
  <li>from a financial scheme the person had - eg a pre-paid funeral plan or insurance policy</li>
  <li>from money from the person’s estate (eg savings) - getting access to this is called applying for a ‘grant of representation’(sometimes called <a href="/wills-probate-inheritance" title="applying for probate: getting a grant of representation">‘applying for probate’</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you have difficulty paying for the funeral, apply for a <a href="/funeral-payments" title="Funeral Payments: what you can get, eligibility and how to claim">Funeral Payment</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Moving a body out of England or Wales</h2>
<p>You need to get permission from a coroner to move a body for a funeral abroad. Apply at least 4 days before you want the body to be moved.</p>

<p>Find a local coroner using the <a rel="external" href="http://www.coronersociety.org.uk/wfOfficeCoroner.aspx" title="find a local coroner on the Coroners' Society of England and Wales website">Coroners’ Society of England and Wales website.</a></p>

</article><article id="organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once"><header><h1>Part 5:  Tell Us Once and organisations you need to contact</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need to report the death to various organisations and government departments.</p>

<p>Most local councils run a service called <a rel="external" href="https://death-tellusonce.direct.gov.uk/Death/Enrich/Recover" title="Tell Us Once">Tell Us Once</a> - they’ll contact different government services for you.</p>

<p>The registrar will explain your options for using Tell Us Once. These are:</p>

</article><article id="what-happens-to-the-persons-body"><header><h1>Part 6: Death abroad</h1>
  </header><p>If the person died abroad, the British Consulate in that country can give advice about:</p>

<ul>
<li>registering the death - how this is done depends on the country</li>
  <li>arranging for the funeral to be in the country the person died in</li>
  <li>bringing the body back to the UK</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>All deaths must be registered in the country where the person died.</p>
</div>

<h2>Bringing the body home</h2>

<p>To bring the body home you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a certified English translation of the death certificate</li>
  <li>permission from a coroner (or equivalent) in the country where the person died to remove the body</li>
</ul>
<p>The British Consulate can help to arrange this.</p>

<p>You can find out more on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/death-abroad" title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office - death abroad information">Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website.</a></p>

<h2>Contacting a register office in England and Wales</h2>

<p>You need to take the death certificate to the <a href="/register-offices" title="search for a register office">register office</a> in the area the funeral is taking place. </p>

<p>As the death has already been registered in the country the person died in, the registrar will give you a ‘Certificate of no liability to register’. You should give this to the funeral director so the funeral can go ahead.</p>

<h2>When a coroner is involved</h2>

<p>If the person is to be cremated, you need a certificate from the coroner (form Cremation 6). </p>

<p>Whether the person is to be buried or cremated, a coroner will be involved if the cause of death abroad is unknown - or if it was sudden, violent or unnatural.</p>
