  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>When someone dies there are things you must do in the first few days:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Get a medical certificate</strong> - you’ll get this from a doctor (GP or at a hospital) and it’s needed to register the death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Register the death</strong> - you should do this within 5 days of the death - you’ll then get the documents you need for the funeral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arrange the funeral</strong> - you can use a funeral director or do it yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorting out the person’s affairs, eg selling their property, can be done later - see <a href="/wills-probate-inheritance" title="Wills, probate and inheritance">Wills, probate and inheritance</a>.</p>


</article><article id="register-the-death"><header><h1>Part 2: Register the death</h1>
  </header><div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If the death has been <a href="/after-a-death/when-a-death-is-reported-to-a-coroner" title="When a death is reported to a coroner">reported to a coroner</a> you can’t register the death until the coroner gives permission.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who can register the death</h2>
<p>You can register the death if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>a relative </li>
  <li>someone who was present at the death</li>
  <li>the person making the funeral arrangements</li>
  <li>the person who found the body</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The registrar would normally only allow other people to register the death if there are no relatives available.</p>
</div>

<h2>Where to register the death</h2>
<p>You should <a href="/register-offices" title="Find a register office">register the death at a register office</a> in the area where the person died.</p>

<h2>What you need to register a death</h2>
<p>You need to take:</p>

<ul>
<li>the medical certificate</li>
  <li>birth and marriage/civil partnership certificates (you can show these to the registrar later)</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to tell the registrar the person’s:</p>

<ul>
<li>full name (including any maiden name)</li>
  <li>date and place of birth (town and county if born in the UK and country if born abroad)</li>
  <li>last address</li>
  <li>occupation</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need the full name, date of birth and occupation of a surviving spouse.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Tell the registrar if the person was getting a State Pension or any benefits.</p>
</div>

<h2>What documents you get from the registrar</h2>

<p>You’ll get a:</p>

<ul>
<li>Certificate for Burial or Cremation (the ‘green form’) - give this to the funeral director</li>
  <li>Certificate of Registration of Death (form BD8) - you complete this if the person was claiming benefits or had a state pension</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting a death certificate</h2>
<p>You need a death certificate to sort out the person’s money, property and possessions.</p>

<p>You can buy one or more death certificates at this time (the cost varies between register offices).</p>


</article><article id="when-a-death-is-reported-to-a-coroner"><header><h1>Part 3: When a death is reported to a coroner</h1>
  </header><p>A doctor may report the death to a coroner, for example if the:</p>

<ul>
<li>cause of death is unknown</li>
  <li>death was violent or unnatural</li>
  <li>death was sudden and unexplained</li>
  <li>doctor caring for the person had not seen them for 14 days before their death</li>
</ul>
<p>The coroner may decide that the cause of death is clear. In this case:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The doctor signs a medical certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You take the medical certificate to the registrar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coroner issues a certificate to the registrar stating a post-mortem isn’t needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Post-mortems</h2>
<p>To find out how the person died, the coroner may decide a post-mortem is needed. This can be done either in a hospital or mortuary.</p>

<p>You can’t object to a post-mortem - but the coroner must tell you (and the person’s GP) when and where the examination will take place.</p>

<p>After the post-mortem:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The coroner will release the body for a funeral once they have completed the post-mortem examinations and no further examinations are needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the body is released with no inquest, the coroner will send send a form (‘Pink Form B - form 101’) to the registrar stating the cause of death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the body is to be cremated, the coroner will also send a ‘Certificate of Coroner - form Cremation 6’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>If the coroner decides to hold an inquest</h2>
<p>A coroner must hold an inquest if the cause of death is still unknown, or if the person: </p>

<ul>
<li>possibly died a violent or unnatural death</li>
  <li>died in prison or police custody</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t register the death until after the inquest. The coroner is responsible for sending the relevant paperwork to the registrar.</p>

</article><article id="arrange-the-funeral"><header><h1>Part 4: Arrange the funeral</h1>
  </header><p>The funeral can usually only take place after the death has been registered.</p>

<h2>Funeral directors</h2>
<p>Most people use a funeral director.</p>

<p>Get more than one quote to compare costs. You should choose a funeral director who’s a member of either:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://www.nafd.org.uk/funeral-advice/funeral-advice-home.aspx" title="National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD)">National Association of Funeral Directors</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://www.saif.org.uk/website/index.html" title="Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors">Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both organisations have codes of practice and have to give you a price list when asked.</p>

<p>Some local councils run their own <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=671&amp;LGIL=8&amp;ServiceName=Find%20out%20about%20a%20council%20funeral" title="Find out about a council funeral">funeral services</a> - eg non-religious burials.</p>

<h2>Arranging the funeral yourself</h2>

<p>To arrange a funeral yourself, contact the Cemeteries and Crematorium Department of your local authority.</p>

<h2>Funeral costs</h2>
<p>Funeral costs can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>funeral director fees</li>
  <li>things the funeral director pays for on your behalf (called ‘disbursements’) - eg a newspaper announcement about the death</li>
  <li>local authority burial fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Often funeral directors list all these costs in their quote.</p>

<h3>Paying for a funeral</h3>
<p>The funeral can be paid:</p>

<ul>
<li>by you or other family members or friends</li>
  <li>from a financial scheme(s) the person had - eg a pre-paid funeral plan or insurance policy</li>
  <li>from money from the person’s estate (eg savings) - getting access to this is called <a href="/wills-probate-inheritance" title="Applying for probate">applying for a ‘grant of representation’</a> (sometimes called ‘applying for probate’)</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you have difficulty paying for the funeral, apply for a <a href="/funeral-payments" title="Applying for a Funeral Payment">Funeral Payment</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Moving a body out of England or Wales</h2>
<p>You need to get permission from a coroner to move a body for a funeral abroad. You need to apply at least 4 days before you want the body to be moved.</p>

<p>Find a local coroner using the <a rel="external" href="http://www.coronersociety.org.uk/wfOfficeCoroner.aspx" title="Coroners' Society of England and Wales website">Coroners’ Society of England and Wales website.</a></p>

</article><article id="organisations-you-need-to-contact"><header><h1>Part 5: Organisations you need to contact</h1>
  </header><p>There are several organisations you should contact to tell them about the person’s death.</p>

<h2>Government organisations</h2>
<p>You may need to contact:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?raction=view&amp;fl0=__dsid%3A&amp;sm=0&amp;ha=34&amp;as=1&amp;sf=&amp;sp_scope=hmrc&amp;sc=hmrc&amp;nh=10&amp;sr=0&amp;cs=ISO-8859-1&amp;tx1=&amp;tx0=49640" title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs contact details">HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Tell us once</h3>

<p>Some local authorities run a service called <a href="/tell-us-once-report-death" title="Tell Us Once: report a death">‘Tell Us Once’</a>. This means they’ll contact the different government services for you - instead of you having to do it yourself.</p>

<p>When you register the death, ask the <a href="register-the-death" title="Register the death">registrar</a> if it’s available in your area.</p>

<h3>Returning a passport</h3>
<p>If the person had a passport, you should cancel it to prevent it being used illegally. You can return it with the form below or hand it into your nearest <a rel="external" href="http://maps.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/MapAction.do?ref=passportofficesregional#mapanchor" title="nearest passport office">passport office.</a></p>

</div>

<h2>The local council</h2>

<p>Contact the local council to cancel things like Council Tax and resident parking permits.</p>

<h2>Banks and other financial organisations</h2>

<p>You may need to close down (or change the details of) the person’s bank accounts or financial schemes - eg mortgage provider, insurance companies and pension provider.</p>


</article><article id="what-happens-to-the-persons-body"><header><h1>Part 6: Death abroad</h1>
  </header><p>If the person died abroad, the British Consulate in that country can give advice about:</p>

<ul>
<li>registering the death - how this is done depends on the country</li>
  <li>arranging for the funeral to be in the country the person died in</li>
  <li>bringing the body back to the UK</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>All deaths must be registered in the country where the person died.</p>
</div>

<h2>Bringing the body home</h2>

<p>To bring the body home you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a certified English translation of the death certificate</li>
  <li>permission from a coroner (or equivalent) in the country where the person died to remove the body</li>
</ul>
<p>The British Consulate can help to arrange this.</p>

<p>You can find out more on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/when-things-go-wrong/death-abroad" title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office - death abroad information">Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website.</a></p>

<h2>Contacting a register office in England and Wales</h2>

<p>You need to take the death certificate to the <a href="/register-offices" title="Search for a register office.">register office</a> in the area the funeral is taking place. </p>

<p>As the death has already been registered in the country the person died in, the registrar will give you a ‘Certificate of no liability to register’. You should give this to the funeral director so the funeral can go ahead.</p>

<h2>When a coroner is involved</h2>

<p>If the person is to be cremated, a certificate from the coroner (form Cremation 6) is needed. </p>

<p>Whether the person is to be buried or cremated, a coroner will be involved if the cause of death abroad is unknown - or if it was sudden, violent or unnatural.</p>
