</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>The Combined Pension Statement (<abbr title="Combined Pension Statement">CPS</abbr>), previously called the Combined Pension Forecast (<abbr title="Combined Pension Forecast">CPF</abbr>), is a voluntary service that lets you combine pension information for your employees in a single statement.</p>

<p>This includes details of their State Pension and workplace or personal pension. The pension information in the statement may help employees plan their retirement, eg by increasing their pension contributions. The <abbr title="Combined Pension Statement">CPS</abbr> service improves pensions data by making sure information held by the scheme matches that held by DWP.</p>

<h2>How to use the <abbr title="Combined Pension Statement">CPS</abbr> service</h2>

</article><article id="perform-a-data-test"><header><h1>Part 3: Perform a data test</h1>
  </header><p>Once you confirm that you’re happy with the registration agreement, the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) will ask you to send a small sample of dummy data to run a data test. </p>

<p>They will use this to check that:</p>

<ul>
<li>your file has the right format and structure</li>
  <li>you’re able to read the return file</li>
  <li>you can send and receive files successfully</li>
</ul>
<p>Details of what the data test involves are included in Chapter 4 of the Pension Service’s technical guide.</p>

</article><article id="get-your-employees-consent"><header><h1>Part 4: Get your employees' consent</h1>
  </header><p>You need to tell your employees that you’re planning to take part in the Combined Pension Statement (<abbr title="Combined Pension Statement">CPS</abbr>) service, and will be asking the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) for information about their State Pension.</p>

<p>You must allow your employees the chance to opt out if they do not want you to do this.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can ask your employees at any time between registering and exchanging live data for the first time.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will provide wording for the consent letter, which you must use. </p>

<p>They will also provide wording for the opt-out letter, which you can adapt to suit your company’s needs, as long as the legal caveats are included.</p>


</article><article id="exchange-data-and-issue-statements"><header><h1>Part 5: Exchange data and issue statements</h1>
  </header><p>Once your data’s been tested and you’ve got your employees’ consent, you’ll need to send their personal details to the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>).</p>

<p>They will estimate each of your employees’ State Pension and send this to you using your chosen data transfer option. The estimates will show the amount of State Pension based on each employee’s National Insurance contribution record so far.</p>

<h2>Sending your employees’ statements</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will provide the template you must use to send your employees their State Pension information. There are 2 versions of this template, which you’ll get as part of your registration agreement. You can choose which one best fits the design of your existing benefit statements.</p>

<p>There are leaflets to support each version of the template, which you can send to your employees along with their statements.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Future Pension Centre can answer your employees’ questions about their State Pension information. The telephone number is included on each employee’s statement.</p>
