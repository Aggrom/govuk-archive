</article><article id="get-your-employees-consent"><header><h1>Part 4: Get your employees' consent</h1>
  </header><p>You need to tell your employees that you’re planning to take part in the Combined Pension Statement (<abbr title="Combined Pension Statement">CPS</abbr>) service, and will be asking the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) for information about their State Pension.</p>

<p>You must must allow your employees the chance to opt out if they do not want you to do this.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can ask you employees at any time between registering and exchanging live data for the first time.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will provide suggested wording for the consent letter. However, you can adapt the letter to suit your company’s needs, as long as the legal caveats are included.</p>


</article><article id="exchange-data-and-issue-statements"><header><h1>Part 5: Exchange data and issue statements</h1>
  </header><p>Once your data’s been tested and you’ve got your employees’ consent, you’ll need to send their personal details to the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>).</p>

<p>They will estimate each of your employees’ State Pension and send this to you using your chosen data transfer option. The estimates will show the amount of State Pension based on each employee’s National Insurance contribution record so far.</p>

<h2>Sending your employees’ statements</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will also provide the template you need to send your employees their State Pension information. There are 2 versions of this template, which you’ll get as part of your registration agreement. You can choose which one best fits the design of your existing benefit statements.</p>

<p>You’ll also get leaflets to support each version of the template, which you can send to your employees along with their statements.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Future Pension Centre can answer your employees’ questions about their State Pension information. Its telephone number is included on each employee’s statement.</p>
