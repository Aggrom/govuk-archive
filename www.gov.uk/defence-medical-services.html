<h2 id="defence-dental-services">Defence Dental Services</h2>

<p>The Defence Dental Service (<abbr title="Defence Dental Services">DDS</abbr>) is lead by Comd <abbr title="Defence Dental Services">DDS</abbr> - Air Cdre Tim Brown.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Dental Services">DDS</abbr> is a tri-service organisation employing approximately 1085 personnel from the Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force and civilian sector who are trained dentists, hygienists, technicians or dental nurses as well as critical support staff. Most treatment is provided at Service establishments (dental centres) in the UK and overseas.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Dental Services">DDS</abbr> has its headquarters at <abbr title="The Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr>(Whittington) in Staffordshire and facilitates control via 12 regional headquarters each headed by a Principle Dental Officer, located in Germany, Cyprus and across the UK. The <abbr title="Defence Dental Services">DDS</abbr> also provides dental services to personnel on operations throughout the world in order to maximise the operational effectiveness of the Armed Forces by making Armed Forces personnel dentally fit for their task.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Dental Services">DDS</abbr> is part of the Joint Medical Command area within the Defence Medical Services.</p>

<h2 id="defence-medical-rehabilitation-centre-dmrc-headley-court">Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (<abbr title="Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre">DMRC</abbr>) Headley Court</h2>

<p><abbr title="Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre">DMRC</abbr> has been located on this site near Epsom, Surrey for over 60 years and has seen much change in that time although perhaps the pace of change is at its greatest at this moment.  Originally founded as RAF Headley Court after the Second World War, for the treatment of injured RAF Aircrew, it is now part of the Joint Medical Command (<abbr title="Joint Medical Command">JMC</abbr>). With a staff of over 360 Service and civilian personnel, it provides a range of rehabilitation services from outpatients through residential courses for those with sports, exercise and industrial injuries up to those with complex life changing trauma injuries including amputation and brain injury. At present there are 135 hostel rooms for force generation patients and 96 in-patient beds to support those who need more nursing support.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre">DMRC</abbr> is the Services premier rehabilitation facility. The wide skill base of it’s personnel allow for the treatment of the most complex of rehabilitation cases offering support to the Regional
Rehabilitation Units and forming an integral part of the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Programme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre">DMRC</abbr> offers access to all specialists engaged in rehabilitation with on-site consultants, physiotherapists, remedial instructors, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, social
workers, prosthetics, podiatrists, a psychologist and a cognitive therapist. It has 5 gymnasiums, a large hydrotherapy pool to support the clinical departments and the new H4H swimming pool.
The medical records department, workshops, supply and administration staff all support <abbr title="Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre">DMRC</abbr>’s clinical role. It also contains the Joint Service’s School for Exercise Remedial Instructors.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre">DMRC</abbr> is entering a period of rapid change and development. This is a direct consequence of the requirement for enhanced services to manage the increasing numbers of trauma survivors who
reach Headley Court with ever more complex needs. However, there is also increasing pressure to return to full deployable fitness those with more minor conditions. These 2 groups of patients might appear to be mutually exclusive; however, each is of equal importance to Defence. <abbr title="Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre">DMRC</abbr>’S force generation work supports the physical component of fighting power whilst its rehabilitation
of complex trauma cases supports the moral component. In addition, as the physical capability of trauma survivors increases so these individuals are now joining force generation groups.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-headley-court">History of Headley Court</h3>

<p>The present day Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre is a working rehabilitation unit so Headley Court is not open to the public.</p>

<p>It has however an interesting history which led to it becoming Grade II Listed;</p>

<p>The Headley Court site has through its history been the location of a small Roman villa; the Court House of the Headley Manor (which was in Headley village); Elizabethan farm buildings and a Queen Anne house. Written records go back to the 17th Century, but these earlier buildings have been demolished.</p>

<p>The mansion used as the Officers’ Mess today is late-Victorian, designed in the Jacobean style by Edward Warren and built by Walter Cunliffe as a family home between 1895 and 1910. It incorporates some surviving features from the Queen Anne house, such as sections of original basement and garden walls, and some external steps and railings.</p>

<p>Walter Cunliffe was a chairman of the North Eastern Railway, and while Governor of the Bank of England from 1913 to 1919, was responsible for arranging the finances of the First World War. He was created Lord Cunliffe, 1st Baron Headley, for his work.</p>

<p>The wider estate was a shooting estate spanning 300 acres which went into decline due to the loss of so many men to the First World War. Headley Court occupies 85 acres of that estate.</p>

<p>Lord Cunliffe died in 1920, but his widow, Lady Cunliffe, continued to live at Headley Court for the next 20 years.</p>

<p>Early in the Second World War, the house and 85 acre estate were requisitioned for use as the Canadian Forces’ HQ in Europe. Headley Court was chosen for the Canadians for its close proximity to Headley Heath which was used for training in trench digging, and neighbouring Headley Park, wartime home of the evacuated Canadian High Commission.</p>

<p>At the end of WWII, the British public donated to a fund in gratitude for the Battle of Britain and the efforts of the wartime Royal Air Force aircrew.</p>

<p>Lady Cunliffe sold the house and 85 acres at a generously low price to the Estate Agents and Auctioneers Institute (now the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors) who managed the fund, so they could build additional buildings and endow a memorial rehabilitation unit to the Air Ministry.</p>

<p>The Government topped up the gift and provided funds to equip and run the rehabilitation and administrative facilities, which were initially for treating injured RAF pilots.</p>

<p>RAF Headley Court opened in 1950 as a unit for officers, expanding to become the Defence Services Medical Rehabilitation Unit for all ranks in 1985, when the Joint Services Medical Rehabilitation Unit at RAF Chessington closed.</p>

<h2 id="defence-medical-services-medical-scientific-expeditions">Defence Medical Services medical scientific expeditions</h2>

<p>The military has a long association with medical research which is supported through funding from the Joint Services Expeditions Trust and the Drummond foundation.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>In the recent past successful expeditions have taken place in 2007 (to Aconcagua 6959m) and 2009 (Everest Base Camp EBC and Island Peak, Nepal, 6300m). These expeditions have introduced many <abbr title="The Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr> personnel to the Joint Services Adventurous Training (JSAT) scheme and generated significant data on acclimatisation to high altitudes.</p>

<p>Ex Imja Tse (to EBC and Island Peak) was a very successful expedition involving 35 personnel from all elements of the <abbr title="The Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr>. The expedition (under the leadership of PONN Rob Wakeford) had a well co-ordinated strategy of training through the JSAT scheme creating some new instructors and many proficiency awards. Future expeditions are being planned to build on this success and create more instructors and experience within <abbr title="The Defence Medical Services">DMS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The research conducted during Imja Tse built on that carried out on Aconcagua, including measuring Brain Naturetic Peptide (<abbr title="Brain Naturetic Peptide">BNP</abbr>), aldosterone, NGAL and cortisol. The interaction between these hormones at altitude is relatively unstudied and potentially crucial for acclimatisation. The initial evidence suggests a link between <abbr title="Brain Naturetic Peptide">BNP</abbr> and acute mountain sickness which has never been reported before. Work from this expedition is in press with the European Journal of Applied Physiology and the Journal of Biological Sciences.</p>

<h3 id="current-projects">Current projects</h3>

<p>As anticipated these field trials (as on Aconcagua) have created many other potential strands for research. In May 2011 23 trekkers made the journey to Kala Pattar (5600M) collecting data on hormonal adaptation to hypoxia as well as recording electrocardiogram (<abbr title="Electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>) traces during exercise and monitoring cardiac function with portable ultrasound. Blood samples were successfully collected at 8 time points, transported frozen along the trail and returned to the UK on dry ice – no mean feat in itself! The samples collected will be analysed over the forthcoming months using funding provided by the Defence Medical Services Research Study Group and the Drummond Foundation.</p>

<p>In June 2012 a large expedition will be taking place to Bolivia with the combined aim of carrying forward the research objectives and achieving some challenging ascents of mountains over 6000m. This expedition hopes to match a significant programme of research to some ambitious adventurous training goals.</p>

<p>These expeditions have the support of the Surgeon General, Surg Vice Admiral Raffaelli who is acting as Service Patron for the expeditions.</p>
