<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are a group of chemicals containing fluorine. F-gases are powerful greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming.</p>

<p>Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are gases which damage the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. They are being phased out, but can be found in older equipment. There are also a few exceptions for certain uses.</p>

<p>Common uses for ODS and F-gases include refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, aerosols, solvents, foam blowing agents, firefighting fluids and high voltage switchgear.</p>

<p>If you manufacture, supply, use, install or service equipment containing F-gases or ODS, or if you manufacture or supply F-gases, you must comply with legislation which aims to limit such releases.</p>

<p>This guide explains what F-gases and ODS are, how different types of businesses can comply with the F-gas and ODS legislation, and how the legislation is enforced.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-fluorinated-gases-and-ozone-depleting-substances">What are fluorinated gases and ozone-depleting substances?</h2>

<p>Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are a family of gases containing fluorine. They are powerful greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. They are stronger than naturally occurring greenhouse gases and their use is regulated.</p>

<p>There are three main types of F-gases:</p>

<ul>
<li>hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</li>
  <li>perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</li>
  <li>sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are chemicals that, if allowed to escape, damage the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. Some ODS also have a global warming potential so they contribute to climate change. F-gases are often used as a replacement for ODS. Many ODS are banned or being phased out. ODS include:</p>

<ul>
<li>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li>
  <li>carbon tetrachloride (used to make CFCs)</li>
  <li>hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)</li>
  <li>halons</li>
  <li>methyl chloroform and methyl bromide</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only produce and market ODS as a feedstock for producing non-ODS substances (eg Teflon) and for laboratory and analytical work. You must clearly label feedstock ODS and indicate that it can only be used for that purpose.</p>

<p>Some equipment still in use may contain banned or controlled ODS, and may also be traded illegally. You should be aware of which are banned, where you might find them and what to do if you discover them.</p>

<h3 id="main-uses-of-f-gases-and-ods">Main uses of F-gases and ODS</h3>

<p>F-gases and ODS are used in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump (RAC) equipment are some of the largest sources of F-gas emissions in the UK. See the pages in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084061937&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">stationary refrigeration and air conditioning: F-gas controls</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086763932&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">stationary refrigeration and air conditioning: ODS controls</a>.</li>
  <li>Some stationary fire protection systems and portable fire extinguishers currently use HFCs. See the pages in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084062397&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">fire protection equipment: F-gas controls</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1086764355&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">fire protection equipment: ODS controls</a>.</li>
  <li>Mobile air conditioning in cars and light vans currently uses HFCs. Other air-conditioned and refrigerated transport currently uses both F-gases and ODS. See the page in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063080&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">mobile air conditioning: F-gas controls</a>.</li>
  <li>Solvents containing F-gases are used to clean components, eg in the electronics and aerospace industries. The use of solvents containing ODS is now banned. See the page in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063156&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">solvent cleaning: F-gas and ODS controls</a>.</li>
  <li>F-gases and ODS have many specialist uses such as in the production of magnesium, different types of foam and high voltage switchgear. See the page in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063662&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">specialist uses of F-gases and ODS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For information about manufacturing, importing and exporting F-gases, see the page in this guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084063941&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">producing and supplying fluids: F-gas and ODS controls</a>.</p>

<h3 id="f-gas-support">F-Gas Support</h3>

<p>F-Gas Support is a government-funded group that provides guidance on complying with F-gas and ODS regulations for manufacturers, operators and others working with F-gases, ODS and related equipment. You can email them at <a href="mailto:fgas-support@enviros.com">fgas-support@enviros.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="stationary-refrigeration-air-conditioning-and-heat-pumps-f-gas-controls">Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pumps: F-gas controls</h2>

<p>Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump (RAC) systems are one of the largest sources of fluorinated greenhouse gas (F-gas) emissions. F-gases commonly used in RAC systems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) - HFC 23, HFC 134a, HFC 152a</li>
  <li>perfluorocarbons (PFCs) - PFC 218, R 218, Refrigerant 218</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="responsibility-for-f-gas-obligations">Responsibility for F-gas obligations</h3>

<p>Most of the key F-gas obligations lie with the operator. An operator is a person or business who has actual power over the technical functioning of the equipment. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>free access to the system, eg supervising its components or functioning</li>
  <li>control over the day-to-day running or function</li>
  <li>powers, including financial, to decide on technical modifications, F-gas quantity modifications or have repairs carried out</li>
</ul>
<p>The owner of the equipment is usually the operator unless such functions have been transferred.</p>

<h3 id="key-f-gas-obligations">Key F-gas obligations</h3>

<p>If you operate RAC equipment containing F-gases, you must meet legal obligations.</p>

<p>Prevent leakage - where it is technically feasible and does not entail disproportionate cost, you must prevent leakage of F-gas refrigerants, and repair any discovered leaks as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Check leaks regularly - how often you are required to check (using certified personnel) depends on the type of system and the quantity of F-gas refrigerants used.</p>

<p>*Half this frequency if fitted with automatic leak detection</p>

<p>The system must be checked within a month after a leak has been repaired to ensure that the repair has been effective.</p>

<p>Install automatic leak detection systems - you must fit a leak detection system to equipment containing 300 kilograms or more of F-gas refrigerant. This system must be checked once a year.</p>

<p>Maintaining records - you must keep records on systems with 3 kilograms or more of F-gases including:</p>

<ul>
<li>quantity and type of F-gas in the system</li>
  <li>quantity of refrigerant added to the system</li>
  <li>quantity of refrigerant recovered through servicing, maintenance and disposal</li>
  <li>identity of business or personnel servicing or maintaining the system, and the dates and results of leak checks and leak detection system checks</li>
</ul>
<p>Recover gas - if F-gas refrigerant is removed from any system, it must be properly recovered by appropriately certified personnel during servicing and decommissioning. You must also ensure that all F-gases that are not recycled or reclaimed are disposed of correctly.</p>

<p>Get certified - any personnel carrying out leak checking, gas recovery, installation, maintenance or servicing of equipment containing F-gas must be appropriately qualified. <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/documents/fgassupport-rac5.pdf">Download RAC qualification and certification guidance from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website (PDF, 325K)</a>.</p>

<p>The person physically taking delivery of F-gas containers does not need to be qualified unless they also perform installation, servicing or repair work.</p>

<p>Hold company certificates - businesses that install, maintain or service the equipment must also hold the relevant company certification. The designated certification bodies in the UK are Refcom, Quidos, Bureau Veritas and Stroma. To get a company certificate you must be able to show that your staff who perform the relevant work hold the correct F-gas qualification, you have the correct tools and procedures available and you have enough staff to cover the work you do.</p>

<p>Label systems - new systems must be correctly labelled, stating the type and quantity of refrigerant used. The label must be located near to the service point. In addition, instruction manuals that come with the equipment must have similar information.</p>

<p>Submit reports - you must complete a report and send it to the European Commission and Defra if you produce, import or export more than 1 tonne of F-gases per year. This is only relevant for imports from and exports to countries outside the European Union. <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/fluor/reporting_en.htm">Find the F-gas standard reporting template on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t use non-refillable containers - use of non-refillable containers for transporting and storing F-gases is banned. You must not place non-refillable containers on the market, except for those manufactured (filled with refrigerant) before 4 July 2007.</p>

<h3 id="alternatives-to-f-gases">Alternatives to F-gases</h3>

<p>You may wish to consider alternatives to F-gases. However, alternatives may also have restrictions on their use and you should consider the overall environmental impact (eg taking into account energy efficiency) and factors such as health and safety when making your choice. Commonly used alternative refrigerants include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ammonia</li>
  <li>carbon dioxide</li>
  <li>hydrocarbons, eg butane and propane</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stationary-refrigeration-air-conditioning-and-heat-pumps-ods-controls">Stationary refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pumps: ODS controls</h2>

<p>Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) were once widely used in the manufacture of refrigeration and air conditioning systems. The substances most commonly used were:</p>

<ul>
<li>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li>
  <li>hydrochlorofluorcarbons (HCFCs), including HCFC blends</li>
  <li>halons</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, refrigeration equipment also used insulating foam that contained ODS.</p>

<p>The supply and use of CFCs and halons in refrigeration equipment is banned throughout the European Union (EU). This means that you can’t use them in the manufacture of new equipment or to maintain existing equipment. If you have equipment designed to use CFCs, you should have stopped using this type of refrigerant by either retro-filling existing systems with an alternative or replacing old equipment.</p>

<p>Virgin HCFCs can’t be used in any new refrigeration equipment or to maintain and service existing systems.</p>

<p>For plant maintenance until 31 December 2014 you may use:</p>

<ul>
<li>reclaimed HCFC refrigerants that have been labelled as reclaimed with information on the batch number and details of the reclamation facility</li>
  <li>recycled HCFC refrigerants recovered from similar equipment by those carrying out the servicing operations</li>
</ul>
<p>If you manufacture or maintain refrigeration equipment you must make sure you don’t use banned ODS. You should always try to use alternatives to CFCs and HCFCs, such as hydrofluorocarbons. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file29101.pdf">download guidance on CFC and HCFC phase-out and alternatives in refrigeration and air conditioning systems from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (BIS) website</a>.</p>

<p>If you own or operate stationary refrigeration or air conditioning equipment you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>use only permitted refrigerants in servicing</li>
  <li>make efforts to prevent, minimise and repair any refrigerant leaks</li>
  <li>make sure ODS are recovered when servicing, maintaining and decommissioning equipment</li>
  <li>allow only qualified technicians to maintain and decommission equipment</li>
  <li>transport ODS in refillable containers</li>
  <li>label containers as reclaimed ODS, with the batch number and source of the ODS</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test-for-leaks">Test for leaks</h3>

<p>You must test for leaks regularly - how often you are required to check (using certified personnel) depends on the type of system and the quantity of ODS.</p>

<h2 id="fire-protection-equipment-f-gas-controls">Fire protection equipment: F-gas controls</h2>

<p>Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) are used in certain types of fire protection systems - such as specialised buildings serving computers or telecommunications. F-gases used in fire protection systems include hydrofluorocarbons.</p>

<p>The use of perfluorocarbons in firefighting equipment is now banned, except for military and aviation uses.</p>

<h3 id="responsibility-for-f-gas-obligations-1">Responsibility for F-gas obligations</h3>

<p>Most of the key F-gas duties lie with the operator. An operator is a person or business who has actual power over the technical functioning of the equipment. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>free access to the system, eg supervising its components or functioning</li>
  <li>control over the day-to-day running or function</li>
  <li>powers, including financial, to decide on technical modifications, F-gas quantity modifications or have repairs carried out</li>
</ul>
<p>The owner of the equipment is usually the operator unless such functions have been transferred.</p>

<h3 id="key-f-gas-obligations-1">Key F-gas obligations</h3>

<p>If you are an operator of fire protection equipment, you must comply with a number of obligations.</p>

<p>Prevent leakage - where it is technically possible and does not involve disproportionate cost, you must prevent leakage of F-gas from stationary fire protection systems and repair any discovered leaks as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Check for leaks regularly - how often you are required to check (using certified personnel) depends on the quantity of F-gases in the system and whether a leak detection system has been installed.</p>

<p>If your business checks for leaks, maintains or services refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pump equipment or fire protection systems containing F-gases, or recovers F-gas from certain types of equipment, you can only take delivery of F-gas if the personnel doing the work are appropriately qualified. The person physically taking delivery doesn’t need to be qualified if they don’t perform recovery work.</p>

<p>Use of non-refillable containers for transporting or storing F-gas is banned.</p>

<h3 id="key-ods-obligations">Key ODS obligations</h3>

<p>In most cases the import and export of ODS is banned. Where they are permitted, trade can only be conducted with approved countries. You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/faq.htm#article5">check a list of countries approved for trade in ODS on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>You can only import and export ODS:</p>

<ul>
<li>for laboratory and analytical uses</li>
  <li>to be used as a feedstock or as a processing agent</li>
  <li>to be destroyed and reclaimed</li>
  <li>for metered dose inhalers</li>
  <li>for critical uses, eg halons in firefighting</li>
  <li>for emergency use (methyl bromide)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not import products and equipment, such as refrigerators, that contain or rely on banned substances unless they are products containing hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) to be repackaged and subsequently re-exported.</p>

<p>Importers of HCFCs or products and equipment that contain or rely on HCFCs need a licence. You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/ods_import.htm">find out how to become a licensed importer of ODS on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>Products and equipment that contain or rely on ODS cannot be exported unless they are for laboratory, analytical or destruction purposes. Some metered dose inhalers containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can also be exported.</p>

<p>If you are able to export your goods you will need a licence. You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/ods_export.htm">find out how to become a licensed exporter of ODS on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>The only ODS you can repackage and export for these purposes are HCFCs until 31 December 2020. The HCFCs must have been repackaged before 31 December 2019.</p>

<p>If you repackage and export HCFCs you must have a licence from the European Commission.</p>

<p>If you manufacture or supply chemical substances you must comply with the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations (CHIP) and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP) Regulation. See the page on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1087521619&amp;r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;type=RESOURCES">classifying and labelling chemicals</a> in our guide <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1086048482&amp;r.l3=1084058363&amp;topicId=1087520983">hazardous substance responsibilities for chemical manufacturers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-f-gas-and-ods-regulations-are-enforced">How F-gas and ODS regulations are enforced</h2>

<p>Several organisations enforce the fluorinated greenhouse gas (F-gas) and ozone-depleting substance (ODS) regulations. If you do not comply you can be fined.</p>

<p>Organisations regulating F-gas and ODS equipment and processes</p>

<p>Regulating organisation Type of equipment/machinery</p>

<p>Local councils
Commercial and retail businesses/
Industrial sites not covered by the Environment Agency</p>

<p>Environment Agency
Industrial facilities with environmental permits</p>

<p>Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
Offshore oil, gas, water and wind installations</p>

<p>Regulating organisations can ensure compliance with F-gas and ODS legislation by serving information notices, enforcement notices or prohibition notices. Failure to comply with a notice can result in a fine.</p>

<h3 id="information-notices">Information notices</h3>

<p>These may be issued to people by regulators in order to obtain further information within set deadlines.</p>

<h3 id="enforcement-notices">Enforcement notices</h3>

<p>Regulators issue enforcement notices if they suspect that businesses are in breach of the regulations. They include a description of the problem, how it can be solved and the date by which it must be fixed.</p>

<h3 id="prohibition-notices">Prohibition notices</h3>

<p>Regulators can serve prohibition notices if they believe specific requirements of the regulations have been or are in danger of being breached, leading to an imminent danger of serious pollution.</p>

<p>Prohibition notices include a description of the problem, how it can be solved and the date by which it must be fixed. They may require you to take action immediately. Prohibition notices can include an order to close down a piece of equipment or a whole site. They will explain the damage that pollution is causing.</p>

<h3 id="advice-and-guidance">Advice and guidance</h3>

<p>F-gas Support provide targeted advice and guidance to help businesses comply with their legal requirements. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/air/fgas/">Find F-gas Support contact details on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website</a>.</p>
