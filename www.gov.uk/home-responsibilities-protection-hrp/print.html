  </header><p>Home Responsibilities Protection (<abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr>) was a scheme to help protect a person’s State Pension. It has been replaced with <a href="/boost-state-pension/national-insurance-credits-eligibility" title="National Insurance credits">National Insurance credits</a> for parents and carers.</p>

<p>You may still be able to apply for <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr> if you were:</p>

<ul>
<li>caring for a sick or disabled person for a complete tax year before April 2010</li>
  <li>a foster carer for a complete tax year before April 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>National Insurance credits for parents and carers replaced <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr> from 6 April 2010. If you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2010 and you had years of <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr> before 6 April 2010, these years have been converted into National Insurance credits, up to a maximum of 22 years. These will go towards your basic <a href="/state-pension" title="State Pension">State Pension</a>.</p>


</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The amount of basic <a href="/state-pension" title="State Pension">State Pension</a> you may become entitled to at State Pension age is based on the number of years of National Insurance contributions you have.</p>

<p>If you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2010 Home Responsibilities Protection (<abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr>) worked by reducing the number of qualifying years you needed for a full basic State Pension, <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr> couldn’t reduce the number of qualifying years below 20.</p>

<p>Example: a woman reaching State Pension age before 6 April 2010 normally needed 39 qualifying years for a full basic State Pension. If she had 10 full years of <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr> these were deducted from 39. This meant that she only needed  29 qualifying years for a full basic State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to additional State Pension if you qualified for <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr> because you:</p>

<ul>
<li>got <a href="/child-benefit" title="Child Benefit">Child Benefit</a> for a child under the age of 6 </li>
  <li>were looking after a sick or disabled person (including a child over the age of 6) </li>
</ul></article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>Depending on your circumstances, either you qualified automatically for Home Responsibilities Protection (<abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr>) or you will have to <a href="#how-to-claim" title="How to claim">apply</a>.</p>

<h2>Qualifying automatically for <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr>

  <li>were a registered foster carer throughout a full tax year from April 2003 and were not getting <a href="/child-benefit" title="Child Benefit">Child Benefit</a> and were not in paid work, or did not earn enough in a tax year for it to count towards the basic <a href="/state-pension" title="State Pension">State Pension</a>

<h2>Married women or widows</h2>

<p>If you were a married woman or a widow, you couldn’t get <abbr title="Home Responsibilities Protection">HRP</abbr> for any complete tax year if:</p>
