<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Administered by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>), Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>) is an electronic customs system for imported third country goods. It allows faster release of goods from countries that are not members of the European Community (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) at the frontier or inland, the use of simpler customs declarations and cashflow benefits to importers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> isn’t compulsory but you may find it useful. There are two <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> procedures. The Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) is used for releasing goods at the frontier to most customs procedures. This may be useful if you are importing perishable goods. The Local Clearance Procedure (<abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr>) is used for moving goods from the frontier to storage and then releasing them to a customs procedure. This guide shows you how to become authorised for <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, how its accounting systems and customs procedures work, whether an agent could help you, and how to find expert help.</p>

<h2 id="cfsp-eligibility-and-restrictions">
<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> eligibility and restrictions</h2>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> are electronic customs declaration processes for speeding up the importation of goods from third countries. You can opt to use either the <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> or <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr>. In both cases you submit the declaration in two stages. Either of these procedures can be used independently or they can be combined to suit your purpose.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility-of-goods-for-cfsp">Eligibility of goods for <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> is suitable for most goods from third countries. However, controlled goods may only be released from the frontier using <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> - ie you cannot use <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> to release controlled goods inland, with certain exceptions.</p>

<h3 id="licensing---controlled-goods-and-cfsp">Licensing - controlled goods and <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Controlled goods are subject to licensing and/or certification and/or special safety or environmental controls and as such must be placed under customs control at the frontier. You will have to use specific <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> frontier Customs Procedure Codes (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr>) for them and complete additional boxes in the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr>. Examples of controlled goods include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ammonium nitrate in solid form and in quantities above 500 kilogrammes</li>
  <li>controlled drugs</li>
  <li>drugs precursor chemicals </li>
  <li>firearms</li>
  <li>fireworks</li>
  <li>rough diamonds</li>
  <li>goods subject to sanctions and arms embargoes</li>
  <li>excise goods with the exception of alcohol and tobacco goods</li>
  <li>ozone depleting substances</li>
</ul>
<p>Fresh produce and live or endangered species are also controlled for <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p>The following goods are excluded from <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> and must not be included in a consignment covered by a <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> declaration:</p>

<h3 id="how-the-process-works">How the process works</h3>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> is based on processes around authorisation, accelerated removal/release, electronic reporting and auditing.</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> goods arrive at the frontier from outside the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>, an initial declaration, known as a Simplified Frontier Declaration (<abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr>), has to be electronically submitted by the trader to allow the release of the goods.</p>

<p>Complete details of the consignment - as a supplementary declaration (<abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr>) - are then due to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> within a set time. This means you don’t have to submit full details before the goods are cleared and that you or your representative can deal with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> alongside other trading procedures such as licences or warehouse procedures. You may either remove goods from the frontier to your premises for clearance, or release them into free circulation or another customs procedure. See the guide on Supplementary Declarations for import.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> treats goods imported under <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> in the same way as goods entering the UK under normal procedures. On arrival, UK Borders Agency staff may check the goods for anti-smuggling, animal and plant health, and standard import prohibition and restriction controls.</p>

<p>Traders then submit an <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> as an electronic Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) via the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system. The supplementary declaration contains details of the shipment and its liability for tax and duty within a certain time. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> has powers to audit your records, systems and paperwork after the goods have cleared so they can be sure any duties and taxes are properly accounted for.</p>

<h3 id="sdp-and-lcp">
<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> and <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> can be used by authorised traders in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p><abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> for releasing goods at the frontier to another customs procedure (though special provisions may apply to customs warehousing). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> for removing goods from the frontier under transit arrangements to designated storage premises inland, then release to a customs procedure such as processing under customs control. This process is carried out using either the Community or National Transit system, for which you need to be authorised. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authorisation">Authorisation</h3>

<p>You or your agent needs to be authorised by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to operate <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>. You must also obtain the authority to use the duty relief schemes such as customs warehousing or inward processing that are often used with <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Traders authorised to use simplified procedures will be issued with an authorisation letter. To apply for <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_PROD1_029979">download the C&amp;E application form C&amp;E48 from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 87K).</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-authorisation-to-use-cfsp">How to get authorisation to use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Trading businesses or their representatives must receive authorisation from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to operate <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>.</p>

<p>To qualify, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be registered as a sole trader, a partnership, or a limited company</li>
  <li>have access to an electronic reporting system</li>
  <li>have a registered Economic Operator (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number, which <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> supplies</li>
  <li>declare third country goods regularly against your <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have a good record of compliance with customs and other official bodies</li>
  <li>be financially solvent </li>
  <li>maintain a set of documented procedures which accurately describes the accounting and logistical processes of your business and enables customs to perform audit-based controls</li>
  <li>be able to use your duty deferment facility or that of a third party for payment and security purposes (payments go through the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> so traders cannot pay in cash or other methods)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out about <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> and <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> in the guide on UK’s import and export processing system CHIEF.</p>

<p>For information on how to apply for your <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number, see the guide on the Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) Scheme.</p>

<p>Traders may also have to meet extra conditions, which their authorising officer will tell them about.</p>

<p>If you want to combine <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> with other customs procedures such as customs warehousing or Inward Processing (IP), you must also be authorised by Customs, and need to apply separately for these procedures. See the guides on temporary admission, Community Transit, inward processing and processing under customs control (PCC).</p>

<h3 id="the-authorisations-traders-and-third-parties-need">The authorisations traders and third parties need</h3>

<p>Traders, particularly small businesses, often use agents or freight forwarders to process their goods under <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, not least because these have the necessary software.</p>

<p>You can complete the process online yourself if you are authorised to use the system. This is called self-representation. There are two other kinds of representation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct representation, where a third party (such as an agent) acts in your name and on your behalf. You remain responsible for customs debts and you need to be authorised to use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, although the third party does not.</li>
  <li>Indirect representation, where a third party acts in their name but on your behalf. You and the third party share liability for the customs debt. You don’t need to be authorised to use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, but the third party does.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be authorised to use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, traders and agents will have to show that they meet a range of conditions regarding accounting systems and records, customs compliance and financial solvency. These criteria will need to be in place in your business before <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can grant authorisation - authorising officers will visit your premises to verify your systems and paperwork.</p>

<h2 id="cfsp-payment-and-security-requirements">
<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> payment and security requirements</h2>

<p>Under <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, all duties and VAT that traders owe for goods have to be paid using a duty deferment account. This procedure is operated through the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight system. The advantages for traders include up to a month’s credit facility and the ability to pay by BACS (banks automated clearing system).</p>

<p>Both traders and their representatives (such as agents, if <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>-authorised) must pay by duty deferment account. Granting duty deferment facilities depends on traders providing a guarantee of financial security. Security will take the form of a blanket authority to debit the authorised traders’ deferment account. Guarantees cover the overall maximum amount in any calendar month of your liabilities. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000013&amp;propertyType=document#P28_1216">find out about deferment in <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance on deferring duty, VAT and other charges on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-duty-deferment-account">Setting up a duty deferment account</h3>

<p>The amount in the duty deferment account has to be enough to cover your duty and VAT liability for one calendar month.</p>

<p>You can reduce the amount you’ll need to keep in the duty deferment account if you belong to the Simplified Import VAT Accounting (SIVA) system or apply for a reduced security facility. To find out about SIVA deferring, read the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/international/imports/siva.htm">reducing financial guarantees provided for import duty and VAT</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a duty deferment account, you need to complete and submit specific <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> forms:</p>

<h3 id="reduced-security">Reduced security</h3>

<p>If you have <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> authorisation and you pay some or all of your duties and taxes to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> through a third parties duty deferment account, you may be able to reduce the amount of security you provide. The security is reduced from a month’s dues to what you would owe over eight to ten days. However, it should still cover your own and any clients’ liabilities for all goods imported under the scheme. Your duty deferment account should still cover a full month’s worth of revenue payments.</p>

<p>Under this scheme you must submit Supplementary Declarations regularly within a shorter time (a minimum of eight days), and complete a Final Supplementary Declaration within four working days of the end of each duty period.</p>

<p>To apply, contact your local Customs office. You can find your local Customs office by contacting the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Excise &amp; Customs Helpline on Tel 0845 010 9000.  </p>

<h2 id="the-cfsp-simplified-declaration-procedure">The <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> Simplified Declaration Procedure</h2>

<p>There are two main ways that traders can use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>. <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> and Local Clearance Procedure. </p>

<p>Once your goods reach the frontier, you can use <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> to release goods to free circulation, Inward Processing, processing under customs control, end use, temporary importation, a Free Zone or customs warehousing.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> process is carried out through the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system in two stages.</p>

<h3 id="stage-1">Stage 1</h3>
<p>The trader provides minimum details of the consignment at the frontier using a <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr>. The date on the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> creates the base date for submitting the supplementary, more detailed declaration. Unless the goods are entering a warehouse, it also establishes the tax point for paying the duty and taxes. You may have to present additional documents for controlled goods, as below.</p>

<h3 id="stage-2">Stage 2</h3>
<p>The trader submits the Supplementary Declaration Import before the end of the fourth working day of the month following the month of acceptance of the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr>. To ensure your goods are released quickly, you must fully and accurately complete the declaration and use the correct <abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="extra-requirements-for-controlled-goods">Extra requirements for controlled goods</h3>

<p>For controlled goods, including those which are subject to special health or environmental conditions, you will have to send import licences or certificates with the hard copy of your <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> to the National Clearance Hub in Salford. In addition, you must use one of the specific <abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr> and complete additional boxes on the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr>.</p>

<p>For civil-use explosives with a health and safety certificate from the Health &amp; Safety Executive, you must send the certificate and supporting documentation with the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr>. For carcinogenic substances you need to produce the exemption certificate and supporting paperwork.</p>

<p>For imports of goods requiring a Rural Payments Agency licence or a drugs licence, you must produce either a paper licence or an e-licence. You must supply the paper licence with a hard copy of the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> to Customs. For e-licences, you should complete the licence/document code, details and status on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and send hard-copy <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> and supporting documentation to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="the-cfsp-local-clearance-procedure">The <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> Local Clearance Procedure</h2>

<p>Under <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> you may use either Community Transit (CT) or National Transit procedures to move the goods from the frontier to designated inland premises for clearance. You cannot import controlled goods under <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr>, however, goods subject to Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate conformity certificates and Plant Health material may be imported under <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> if you are authorised by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or the Forestry Commission.</p>

<p>To use <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> you need additional authorisation for transit procedures as well as authorisation for <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>. You must be authorised to hold a comprehensive guarantee or a guarantee waiver and become an authorised consignee. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_Forms&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000472">get an application form to use transit simplified procedures on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Transit movements are discharged on arrival at inland premises, after which the goods may remain in temporary storage for up to 20 days. See the guide on using the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) to move goods across the EU and EFTA countries. You can also view information on CT in the guide on Community transit procedures.</p>

<p>Traders can use <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> to release goods to a customs procedure in five stages.</p>

<h3 id="stage-1-1">Stage 1</h3>
<p>The trader provides minimum details of the consignment to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> at the frontier using a Form C21 for Community transit, or a <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr> for National Transit.</p>

<h3 id="stage-2-1">Stage 2</h3>
<p>The trader uses either Community or National Transit to move the goods to designated premises inland. Once the transit movement is ended, the goods are considered to be under the Temporary Storage procedure and can be stored for up to 20 days before being entered to a customs procedure.</p>

<h3 id="stage-3">Stage 3</h3>
<p>The trader uses Local Clearance records to enter goods to a customs procedure. The date of entry will set the base date for submitting the Supplementary Declaration Import (SDI) via <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. Unless goods are entered to a customs warehouse, it also establishes the tax point.</p>

<h3 id="stage-4">Stage 4</h3>
<p>The trader submits the SDI before the end of the fourth working day of the following month.</p>

<h3 id="stage-5">Stage 5</h3>
<p>The trader also submits a Final Supplementary Declaration before the end of the fourth working day of the month following the month of acceptance of the <abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declaration">SFD</abbr>. <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will validate your SFDs to make sure you are authorised to use the procedure.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000188&amp;propertyType=document#P7_79">read Public Notice 760 about <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="excise-goods">Excise goods</h3>

<p>You can’t use <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> to release excise goods at the frontier, but you can use the procedure to release goods from warehousing and Free Zones using <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> removals. You must submit your supplementary declarations according to the excise reporting periods.</p>

<p>If you need a transit guarantee, you will need to comply with additional conditions.</p>

<h2 id="cfsp-and-customs-warehousing">
<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> and customs warehousing</h2>

<p>Traders can use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> to import goods using customs warehousing to suspend duty payments.</p>

<p>Goods can be entered into customs warehouses using <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplified Declaration Procedure. A Simplified Frontier Declaration is followed by a Supplementary Declaration Import (SDI) to enter imports to a customs warehouse.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr>. Goods are removed from the frontier to designated premises under transit procedures and move into a period of temporary storage. On removal from temporary storage you will need to enter the goods to customs warehousing in your local clearance (LC) record and subsequently submit a SDI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traders who’ve placed their goods in customs warehousing can remove them using <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> with a Supplementary Declaration Warehouse (SDW) removal declaration or the standard paper warehousing procedure.</p>

<p>If you choose <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> to remove the goods, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make an entry in your LC record which will set the tax point and base date for the submission of a SDW. The SDW deadline is the end of the fourth working day of the month following the month of the entry into the records.</li>
  <li>Remove goods from the warehouse.</li>
  <li>Submit the SDW</li>
  <li>Submit a Final Supplementary Declaration by the end of the fourth working day of the month following the month of the entry into the local clearance records.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000188&amp;propertyType=document#P7_79">find out about using customs warehousing in Section 7 of Notice 760 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="using-cfsp-agents">Using <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> agents</h2>

<p>Many businesses find using third-party service providers a cost-effective and efficient way to deal with customs formalities. You may make savings by avoiding costs for specialist staff and the software required for customs procedures, including <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Freight forwarders, customs agents and brokers may offer <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> clearance. Freight forwarders, whose principal business is to move goods to be transported from one country to another, also generally provide customs clearance facilities. Customs agents and brokers only handle paperwork at customs points or frontiers for you. You can find out about brokers and forwarders in the guide on using brokers and forwarders.</p>

<p>If you wish to use a third party service provider for <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, they must either be authorised or hold authority to act on your behalf. You should also make sure that you provide them with full and accurate information.</p>

<p>To be authorised to use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, agents will have to show that they meet a range of conditions regarding accounting systems and records, customs compliance and solvency.</p>

<h3 id="paying-duty-through-a-third-party">Paying duty through a third party</h3>

<p>There are three types of representative - self, direct and indirect. The most common, a direct representative, acts in your name but isn’t liable for your customs debt. An indirect representative acts in their own name and on your behalf. Indirect representatives are held jointly and severally liable for your customs debt.</p>

<p>To pay your <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> duty and taxes, you can use your own or your representatives duty deferment account. However, if you use an indirect representative they will have to provide security for your duty and VAT liability for one calendar month unless they are approved for reduced security.</p>

<p>If you are an existing <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> trader and wish to act as an agent for another trader, you must gain agreement from your customer to use their deferment account. <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=OW2w--uvGyU&amp;formId=128">See form C 1207N - Standing Authority for Agents to request Deferment of Duty against Importers Deferment Approval Number on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a> You must then notify your <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> authorising office. They will amend your authorisation to allow use of your customer’s deferment account.</p>

<p>Customs civil penalties apply to breaches in the rules and regulations in customs procedures. Traders may receive a warning letter or have to pay fines.</p>

<p>Customs civil evasion penalties may be imposed when it can be established that a trader has deliberately evaded the payment of a duty or import VAT.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> can also seize goods when the correct duty and or import VAT has been evaded, and traders may face prosecution.</p>

<p>You can find out how customs penalty schemes work in the guide on customs seizures and penalties.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint or suggestion, you should try to resolve it with your local Customs office first. You have the right to a formal departmental review at <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.
