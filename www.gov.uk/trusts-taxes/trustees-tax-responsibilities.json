Their role is to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>deal with the assets according to the trust deed</li>\n  <li>manage the trust on a day-to-day basis and pay any tax due</li>\n  <li>decide how to invest or use the trust&rsquo;s assets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the trustees change, the trust can still continue, but there always has to be at least 1 trustee.</p>\n\n<h2>Beneficiaries</h2>\n\n<p>There might be more than 1 beneficiary, like a whole family or defined group of people. They may benefit from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the income of a trust only - eg from renting out a house held in a trust</li>\n  <li>the assets only - eg getting shares held in a trust when they reach a certain age</li>\n  <li>both the income and assets of the trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n"},{"web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/trusts-taxes/types-of-trust","slug":"types-of-trust","order":2,"title":"Types of trust","body":"<p>The main types of trust are listed below - they&rsquo;re all taxed differently.</p>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"overview\" title=\"overview\">overview</a> for definitions of &lsquo;trustee&rsquo;, &lsquo;settlor&rsquo; and &lsquo;beneficiary&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<h2>Bare trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the assets and income of the trust. </p>\n\n<p>Bare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is 18 in England and Wales, or 16 in Scotland. </p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gary leaves his sister Juliet some money in his will. The money is held in trust. </p>\n\n<p>As the beneficiary Juliet is entitled to the money and any income (eg interest) it earns.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Interest in possession trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are trusts where the beneficiary is entitled to trust income as it&rsquo;s produced, but not the assets, which pass to a different beneficiary in the future.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stanley creates a trust for all the shares he owned. </p>\n\n<p>When he dies, the income from those shares goes to his wife for the rest of her life. When she dies, the shares will pass to their children.</p>\n\n<p>Stanley&rsquo;s wife is the income beneficiary and has an &lsquo;interest in possession&rsquo; in the trust. She doesn&rsquo;t have a right to the shares themselves.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Discretionary or accumulation trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the trustees can decide how to use the trust income, and sometimes the assets.</p>\n\n<p>Trustees can decide:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>what gets paid out (income or assets)</li>\n  <li>which beneficiary to make payments to</li>\n  <li>how often payments are made</li>\n  <li>any conditions to impose on the beneficiaries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Discretionary trusts are sometimes set up to put assets aside for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a future need, like a grandchild who may need more financial help than other beneficiaries at some point in their life</li>\n  <li>beneficiaries who aren&rsquo;t capable or responsible enough to deal with money themselves</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Accumulation trusts</h3>\n\n<p>This is where the trustees can accumulate income within the trust and add it to the trust&rsquo;s value. They can also pay income out, as with discretionary trusts.</p>\n\n<h2>Mixed trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are a combination of more than one type of trust. The different parts of the trust are treated according to the tax rules that apply to each part.</p>\n\n<h2>Settlor-interested trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the settlor benefits from the trust. They&rsquo;re 1 of the following types of trust:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>interest in possession trusts</li>\n  <li>accumulation trusts</li>\n  <li>discretionary trusts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dave can no longer work due to illness. He sets up a discretionary trust to make sure he has money in the future and puts some of his money in it.</p>\n\n<p>He&rsquo;s the settlor, but he may also benefit from the trust because the trustees can make payments to him.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Non-resident trusts</h2>\n\n<p>This is a trust set up or managed by someone living abroad.

However, the main differences are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the beneficiary must become fully entitled to the assets in the trust by the age of 25</li>\n  <li>when the beneficiary is aged between 18 and 25, Inheritance Tax exit charges will apply </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Trusts for disabled beneficiaries</h2>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no 10-yearly charge or exit charge on this type of trust as long as the asset stays in the trust and remains the &lsquo;interest&rsquo; of the beneficiary.</p>\n\n<p>You also don&rsquo;t have to pay Inheritance Tax on the transfer of assets into a trust for a disabled person as long as the person making the transfer survives for 7 years after making the transfer. </p>\n\n<h2>Bare trusts</h2>\n\n<p>These are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the assets and income of the trust. </p>\n\n<p>Transfers into a bare trust may also be exempt from Inheritance Tax, as long as the person making the transfer survives for 7 years after making the transfer.</p>\n\n<h2>Paying Inheritance Tax</h2>\n\n<p>You pay Inheritance Tax using form IHT100.
