  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You can use the <a href="/calculate-your-child-maintenance" title="child maintenance calculator">child maintenance calculator</a> to work out how much your child maintenance payments should be. </p>

<p>The calculator is based on the rules used by the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) and the Child Maintenance Service. </p>

<p>You can use it if you’re <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency" title="arranging child maintenance through the csa or Child Maintenance Service">using the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service</a> or if you’re <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself" title="arranging child maintenance yourself">arranging child maintenance yourself</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re not arranging child maintenance yourself, you’ll be told when you apply whether your case will be managed by the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> or Child Maintenance Service. </p>

<p>They have different ways of working out payments and which service manages your case depends on your circumstances.</p>


</article><article id="how-the-child-support-agency-works-out-child-maintenance"><header><h1>Part 2: How the Child Support Agency works out child maintenance</h1>
  </header><p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) looks at several things to work out child maintenance, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the paying parent’s net weekly income</li>
  <li>the number of children needing child maintenance</li>
  <li>how often those children stay overnight with the paying parent</li>
  <li>if the paying parent or their partner gets Child Benefit for any other children</li>
  <li>if the paying parent is paying child maintenance for any other children</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The parent or carer they live with is the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> works out net income</h2>

<p>The paying parent’s income is:</p>

<ul>
<li>their earnings from employment</li>
  <li>taxable profits from self-employment</li>
  <li>money from an occupational or personal pension</li>
  <li>certain tax credits</li>
</ul>
<p>Net income is what’s left after the following are deducted:</p>

<ul>
<li>tax</li>
  <li>National Insurance</li>
  <li>pension contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can get information about income from the paying parent’s employer or HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<h2>If the paying parent has to pay for other children</h2>

<p>If the paying parent uses the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> to pay child maintenance to more than one receiving parent, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
<li>work out the total amount of child maintenance they have to pay</li>
  <li>divide this between all the receiving parents, according to how many children they care for</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> has produced a leaflet explaining in more detail how child maintenance is worked out.</p>

</article><article id="rates-used-by-the-child-support-agency"><header><h1>Part 3: Rates used by the Child Support Agency</h1>
  </header><p>There are 4 rates of child maintenance. They’re used with the paying parent’s income to work out a weekly amount of child maintenance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The parent or carer they live with is the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h3>Nil rate</h3>

<p>This means the parent the child doesn’t live with doesn’t have to pay child maintenance because they:</p>

<ul>
<li>are a student</li>
  <li>are a child aged 16 or under (or 18 or under if they’re in full-time education not higher than A-level)</li>
  <li>are a prisoner</li>
  <li>get an allowance for work-based training or Skillseekers training (in Scotland)</li>
  <li>live in a care home or independent hospital and get help with the fees</li>
  <li>are 16 to 17 years old and they or their partner get certain benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flat rate</h3>

<p>This is £5 per week no matter how many children are involved. It’s used if the paying parent’s weekly income is between £5 and £100 and they don’t qualify for the nil rate. </p>

<p>It’s also used if they get certain benefits, including (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Armed Forces Compensation Scheme payments</li>
  <li>Bereavement Allowance</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
  <li>State Pension</li>
  <li>Training Allowance</li>
  <li>War Disablement Pension</li>
</ul>
<p>If the paying parent lives with a partner, the flat rate will be used if the partner gets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reduced rate</h3>

<p>This is used if the paying parent’s net weekly income is more than £100 but less than £200. They pay the flat rate of £5 plus a percentage of their net weekly income.</p>

<h3>Basic rate</h3>

<p>This is a percentage of the paying parent’s net income. It’s used if they have a net weekly income of £200 or more. The percentage depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of children needing child maintenance</li>
  <li>the number of other children the paying parent or their partner get Child Benefit for</li>
</ul></article><article id="child-maintenance-before-march-2003"><header><h1>Part 4: Child maintenance before March 2003</h1>
  </header><p>If you opened a child maintenance case before March 2003, your case will be worked out using an old set of rules. </p>

<p>Cases opened before March 2003 are called ‘1993 scheme’ cases. Cases opened after March 2003 are ‘2003 scheme’ cases.</p>

<p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) has produced a leaflet to explain how this works.</p>

</div>

<h2>Moving to the 2003 scheme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> has to use the same rules to work out child maintenance for every child with the same paying or receiving parent.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The parent or carer they live with is the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will move your case to the March 2003 rules if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re part of a <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> case opened before March 2003</li>
  <li>you’ve made a new application or been named in one on or after 3 March 2003</li>
  <li>the children in the new application have a different parent to the children in the existing case</li>
</ul>
<p>If your case needs to be moved, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will contact you and the other parent to let you know.</p>

<p>Your child maintenance payments will usually change if your case is moved. Read the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> leaflet for more information.</p>

</article><article id="how-the-child-maintenance-service-works-out-child-maintenance"><header><h1>Part 5: How the Child Maintenance Service works out child maintenance</h1>
  </header><p>The Child Maintenance Service usually follows 6 steps when working out the weekly amount of child maintenance.</p>

<p>Once it’s been decided, it’s reviewed each year, when any changes in circumstances are taken into account.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The parent or carer they live with is the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>Step 1 - working out income</h2>

<p>The Child Maintenance Service will find out the paying parent’s yearly gross income from information supplied by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) and check if they’re getting benefits (student grants and loans don’t count as income).</p>

<h2>Step 2 - looking at things that affect income</h2>

<p>The Child Maintenance Service will check for things that could change the gross income amount (eg pension payments, other children they support). Then they’ll convert the yearly gross income into a weekly figure.</p>

<h2>Step 3 - child maintenance rates</h2>

<p>One of 5 rates will be applied, based on the gross weekly income of the paying parent:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Gross weekly income</th>
      <th>Rate</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Below £5</td>
      <td>Nil</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£100 or less, or if the paying parent gets certain benefits</td>
      <td>Flat</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£100.01 to £199.99</td>
      <td>Reduced</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£200 to 800</td>
      <td>Basic</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>£800.01 to £3,000</td>
      <td>Basic Plus</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Step 4 - other children</h2>

<p>The Child Maintenance Service will take into account the number of children the paying parent has to pay child maintenance for, including other children living with them and any arrangements that have been made directly with an ex-partner. </p>

<h2>Step 5 - weekly amount of child maintenance</h2>

<p>Using information from the first 4 steps, the Child Maintenance Service decides the weekly child maintenance amount.</p>

<h2>Step 6 - shared care</h2>

<p>This is when a child a parent pays child maintenance for stays overnight with them. If this applies, the Child Maintenance Service makes a deduction to the weekly child maintenance amount based on the average number of ‘shared care’ nights a week.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Maintenance won’t need to be paid by either parent if there’s equal shared care.</p>
</div>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>The Child Maintenance Service will apply fees in the future - an application fee and a ‘collection fee’ for collecting and paying out child maintenance. The collection fee may affect how much parents will pay and receive.</p>

<p>If you’re a paying parent you don’t need to do anything about this now - the Child Maintenance Service will write to you before any fees are introduced. </p>

<p>If you use Direct Pay (where you get the Child Maintenance Service to work out how much you should pay, but pay the receiving parent directly instead of through the service), there usually won’t be any collection fees. </p>
