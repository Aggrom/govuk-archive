  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="child-maintenance-rates"><header><h1>Part 1: Child maintenance rates</h1>
  </header><p>You can use the <a href="/calculate-child-maintenance" title="child maintenance calculator">child maintenance calculator</a> to work out how much your child maintenance payments should be. </p>

<p>The calculator is based on the rules used by the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>). You can use it if you’re <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-child-support-agency" title="using the CSA">using the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr></a> or if you’re <a href="/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself" title="arranging child maintenance yourself">arranging child maintenance yourself</a>.</p>

<h2>Rates used by the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are 4 rates of child maintenance. They’re used with the paying parent’s income to work out a weekly amount of child maintenance. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The parent or carer they live with is the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h3>Nil rate</h3>

<p>This means the parent the child doesn’t live with doesn’t have to pay child maintenance because they:</p>

<ul>
<li>are a student</li>
  <li>are a child aged 16 or under (or 18 or under if they’re in full-time education not higher than A-level)</li>
  <li>are a prisoner</li>
  <li>get an allowance for work-based training or Skillseekers training (in Scotland)</li>
  <li>live in a care home or independent hospital and get help with the fees</li>
  <li>are 16 to 17 years old and they or their partner get certain benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flat rate</h3>

<p>This is £5 per week no matter how many children are involved. It’s used if the paying parent’s weekly income is between £5 and £100 and they don’t qualify for the nil rate. </p>

<p>It’s also used if they get certain benefits, including (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Armed Forces Compensation Scheme payments</li>
  <li>Bereavement Allowance</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
  <li>State Pension</li>
  <li>Training Allowance</li>
  <li>War Disablement Pension</li>
</ul>
<p>If the paying parent lives with a partner, the flat rate will be used if the partner gets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reduced rate</h3>

<p>This is used if the paying parent’s net weekly income is more than £100 but less than £200. They pay the flat rate of £5 plus a percentage of their net weekly income.</p>

<h3>Basic rate</h3>

<p>This is a percentage of the paying parent’s net income. It’s used if they have a net weekly income of £200 or more. The percentage depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of children needing child maintenance</li>
  <li>the number of other children the paying parent or their partner get Child Benefit for</li>
</ul></article><article id="information-the-child-support-agency-uses"><header><h1>Part 2: Information the Child Support Agency uses</h1>
  </header><p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) looks at several things to work out child maintenance, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the paying parent’s net weekly income</li>
  <li>the number of children needing child maintenance</li>
  <li>how often those children stay overnight with the paying parent</li>
  <li>if the paying parent or their partner gets Child Benefit for any other children</li>
  <li>if the paying parent is paying child maintenance for any other children</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The parent or carer they live with is the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> works out net income</h2>

<p>The paying parent’s income is:</p>

<ul>
<li>their earnings</li>
  <li>money from an occupational or personal pension</li>
  <li>certain tax credits</li>
</ul>
<p>Net income is what’s left after the following are deducted:</p>

<ul>
<li>tax</li>
  <li>National Insurance</li>
  <li>pension contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> can get information about income from the paying parent’s employer or HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<h2>If the paying parent has to pay for other children</h2>

<p>If the paying parent uses the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> to pay child maintenance to more than one receiving parent, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
<li>work out the total amount of child maintenance they have to pay</li>
  <li>divide this between all the receiving parents, according to how many children they care for</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> has produced a leaflet explaining in more detail how child maintenance is worked out.</p>

</article><article id="child-maintenance-before-march-2003"><header><h1>Part 3: Child maintenance before March 2003</h1>
  </header><p>If you opened a child maintenance case before March 2003, your case will be worked out using an old set of rules. </p>

<p>Cases opened before March 2003 are called ‘1993 scheme’ cases. Cases opened after March 2003 are ‘2003 scheme’ cases.</p>

<p>The Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) has produced a leaflet to explain how this works.</p>

</div>

<h2>Moving to the 2003 scheme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> has to use the same rules to work out child maintenance for every child with the same paying or receiving parent.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The ‘paying parent’ is the parent the child doesn’t live with. The parent or carer they live with is the ‘receiving parent’.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will move your case to the March 2003 rules if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re part of a <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> case opened before March 2003</li>
  <li>you’ve made a new application or been named in one on or after 3 March 2003</li>
  <li>the children in the new application have a different parent to the children in the existing case</li>
</ul>
<p>If your case needs to be moved, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> will contact you and the other parent to let you know.</p>

<p>Your child maintenance payments will usually change if your case is moved. Read the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> leaflet for more information.</p>
