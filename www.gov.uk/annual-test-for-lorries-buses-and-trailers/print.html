</header><article id="vehicles-that-must-take-the-annual-test"><header><h1>Part 1: Vehicles that must take the 'annual test'</h1>
  </header><p>The annual test for lorries, trailers and buses is similar to the MOT test that cars take each year.</p>

<p>The annual test is for:</p>

<ul>
<li>motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 3,500 kilograms</li>
  <li>vehicles that are built or have been adapted to form part of an articulated vehicle</li>
  <li>semi-trailers</li>
  <li>horseboxes with a gross weight of more than 3,500 <abbr title="Kilograms">kg</abbr>
</li>
  <li>‘A’ frame trailers and converter dollies manufactured on or after 1 January 1979</li>
  <li>other trailers with an unladen weight of more than 1,020 <abbr title="Kilograms">kg</abbr>
</li>
  <li>all public service vehicles with more than 8 passenger seats - not including the driver’s seat</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the test</h2>

<p>Lorries and buses (including coaches) must be tested each year. The first test should be 12 months after the vehicle was first registered with DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency).</p>

<p>Trailers must be tested 1 year after they were first sold or supplied.</p>

<p>The test can be done at a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> Goods Vehicle Testing Station (<abbr title="Goods Vehicle Testing Station">GVTS</abbr>) or a privately owned Authorised Testing Facility (<abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>). Both use <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> staff and the same test standards.</p>

<h2>Before the test</h2>

<p>You can get your vehicle checked by a qualified mechanic to prepare for the test.</p>

</article><article id="at-the-test-centre"><header><h1>Part 4: At the test centre</h1>
  </header><p>Bring the following documents to the test centre:</p>

<ul>
<li>your appointment letter if you have one</li>
  <li>the vehicle’s last annual test certificate</li>
  <li>the vehicle’s plating certificate</li>
  <li>a <a href="/tachographs" title="Tachographs">tachograph</a> exemption form, if your vehicle is exempt </li>

</div>

<p>You’ll need to drive your own vehicle throughout the test unless otherwise asked.</p>

<h2>Horseboxes</h2>

<p>You should load the horsebox with heavy items like bags of feed, fertiliser or straw bales. This is so that the centre can check the brakes work properly.</p>

<p>Tell the testing centre about any changes you’ve made to the horsebox since its last test.</p>

<p>There is more information about testing standards for horseboxes in the <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> guide for horsebox and trailer owners.</p>

</div>

<h2>Repairs</h2>

<p>If an inspector thinks minor repairs are needed to your vehicle and they can be done quickly and safely you may be allowed to do so, but only if it doesn’t delay the testing of other vehicles</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> staff can’t provide tools or materials or help with repairs.</p>

<h2>Failing the test</h2>

<p>If your vehicle fails the annual test you’ll have to take it away and get the faults fixed.</p>

<p>Unlike with an MOT, most centres won’t be able to make the repairs for you. Once they’re made you’ll have to book another test and pay a retest fee.</p>

<h3>Major faults</h3>

<p>Some faults are so serious that the vehicle can’t be allowed on the road. In this case, the inspector may allow on-site emergency repairs.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>If you don’t agree with the test result you can appeal. Ask the test inspector for details of the appeals process.</p>
