  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="vehicles-that-must-take-the-annual-test"><header><h1>Part 1: Vehicles that must take the 'annual test'</h1>
  </header><p>The annual test for lorries, trailers and buses is similar to the MOT test that cars take each year.</p>

<p>The annual test is for:</p>

<ul>
<li>motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 3,500 kilograms</li>
  <li>vehicles that are built or have been adapted to form part of an articulated vehicle</li>
  <li>semi-trailers</li>
  <li>‘A’ frame trailers and converter dollies manufactured on or after 1 January 1979</li>
  <li>other trailers with an unladen weight of more than 1,020 kg</li>
  <li>all public service vehicles with more than 8 passenger seats - not including the driver’s seat</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorries and buses (including coaches) must be tested each year. The first test should be 12 months after the vehicle was first registered with DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency).</p>

<p>Trailers must be tested 1 year after they were first sold or supplied.</p>

<p>The test can be done at a <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> Goods Vehicle Testing Station (<abbr title="Goods Vehicle Testing Station">GVTS</abbr>) or a privately owned Authorised Testing Facility (<abbr title="Authorised Testing Facility">ATF</abbr>). Both use <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> staff and the same test standards.</p>


</article><article id="book-your-test"><header><h1>Part 2: Book your test</h1>
  </header><p>Your vehicle must be tested at a specialist testing station authorised by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can book up to 93 days ahead, using the online test booking system for either a <a href="/book-a-single-annual-test-online" title="Book a single annual test online">single test</a> or <a href="/book-tests-for-multiple-vehicles-online" title="Book tests for multiple vehicles online">multiple tests</a>. You must be already registered with <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> to use the multiple test booking service.</p>

<p>You can also book by phone, fax or letter directly with the test station you want to use. <a rel="external" href="http://www.transportoffice.gov.uk/crt/doitonline/bl/vosateststationlocations/vosateststationlocations.htm" title="VOSA Testing Stations">Contact details for the test stations</a> are on the <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> website. </p>


</article><article id="fees"><header><h1>Part 3: Fees</h1>
  </header><p>Fees for the annual test vary depending on the size and type of your vehicle.</p>

<p>The current annual test and re-test fees for goods vehicles and for public service vehicles are available from <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>.</p>

</article><article id="at-the-test-centre"><header><h1>Part 4: At the test centre</h1>
  </header><p>Bring the following documents to the test centre:</p>

<ul>
<li>your appointment letter if you have one</li>
  <li>the vehicle’s last annual test certificate</li>
  <li>the vehicle’s plating certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll need to drive your own vehicle throughout the test unless otherwise asked.</p>

<h2>Repairs</h2>

<p>If an inspector thinks minor repairs are needed to your vehicle and they can be done quickly and safely you may be allowed to do so, but only if it doesn’t delay the testing of other vehicles</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> staff can’t provide tools or materials or help with repairs.</p>

<h2>Failing the test</h2>

<p>If your vehicle fails the annual test you’ll have to take it away and get the faults fixed.</p>

<p>Unlike with an MOT, most centres won’t be able to make the repairs for you. Once they’re made you’ll have to book another test and pay a retest fee.</p>

<h3>Major faults</h3>

<p>Some faults are so serious that the vehicle can’t be allowed on the road. In this case, the inspector may allow on-site emergency repairs.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>If you don’t agree with the test result you can appeal. Ask the test inspector for details of the appeals process.</p>
