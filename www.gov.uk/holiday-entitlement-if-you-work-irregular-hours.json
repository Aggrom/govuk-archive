For example if you work 4, 12 hour shifts followed by 4 days off, then your average working week may be calculated by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[number of shifts worked (4) \u00f7 total number of days in shift pattern(8)] x 7 days = 3.5, 12 hour shifts per week</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your statutory holiday entitlement may be calculated by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>3.5 shifts per week x 5.6 (statutory leave entitlement) = 19.6, 12 hours shifts holiday</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Working annualised hours</h2>\n<p>Your employer needs to calculate how many hours on average you work over the year. </p>\n\n<p>For example if you work 1,600 hours a year, your average working week will be 34.48 hours. This may be calculated by excluding statutory leave entitlement: </p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>52 weeks -  5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) = 46.4 weeks of working</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>1,600 \u00f7 46.4 = 34.48 hours a week</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your holiday entitlement can be calculated by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) x 34.48 hours a week = 193.09 hours paid holiday for the year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Working compressed hours</h2>\n<p>For example if you work 36 hours over 4 days, you would be entitled to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>36 hours x 5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) = 201.6 hours paid holiday for the year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You would take the number of hours holiday that you would normally have worked - eg if you work 36 hours over 4 days, you would take 9 hours (36 \u00f7 4) for each day of holiday.</p>\n\n<h2>Casual or irregular hours</h2>\n<p>Your employer may calculate your holidays as your entitlement builds up (&lsquo;accrues&rsquo;) for each hour you work. This can be done by converting 5.6 weeks of statutory holiday entitlement into a percentage of hours worked over the year (time worked over the year should exclude your statutory leave entitlement):</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>52 weeks -  5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) = 46.4 weeks of working</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>5.6 \u00f7 46.4 x 100 = 12.07%</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you worked for 10 hours you would be entitled to 72.6 minutes paid holiday:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li><p>(12.07\u00f7100) x 10 hours work = 1.21 hours</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>1.21 hours = 60 minutes + (.21 x 60 mins) = 72.6 minutes</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n"}],["tags",[{"title":"Holidays, time off, sick leave, maternity and paternity leave","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/working%2Ftime-off.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes career breaks and the holiday entitlement calculator","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=working%2Ftime-off","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working/time-off"},"parent":{"title":"Working, jobs and pensions","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/tags/working.json","web_url":null,"details":{"description":"Includes holidays and finding a job","type":"section"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/with_tag.json?tag=working","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/browse/working"},"parent":null}}]],["related",[{"title":"Holiday entitlement","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/holiday-entitlement-your-rights.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-your-rights","format":"guide","details":{"need_id":"355","business_proposition":false}},{"title":"Calculate your holiday entitlement","id":"https://contentapi.production.alphagov.co.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement.json","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement","format":"smart-answer","details":{"need_id":"355","business_proposition":false}}]]],"parts":null}
