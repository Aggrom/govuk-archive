<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a cattle farmer, it’s essential that you take the necessary steps to protect the health of your animals. Maintaining good health is important to ensure acceptable standards of animal welfare, but such measures will also maximise the productivity of your herd.</p>

<p>This guide has information about the main diseases affecting cattle, including notifiable diseases, which must be reported, and zoonoses, which can infect humans. It covers general disease prevention and legal controls to prevent specific risks, as well as describing your legal responsibilities relating to cattle feed, medicines and hormonal treatments.</p>

<p>For specific advice relating to the animal welfare aspects of good herd management, see the related guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/cattle-welfare-regulations">cattle welfare</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cattle-health-and-cross-compliance">Cattle health and cross compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and other direct payments - eg the Environmental Stewardship schemes - you must meet all relevant cross compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (<abbr title="requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAECs</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smr-10---restrictions-on-the-use-of-substances-having-hormonal-or-thyrostatic-action-and-beta-agonists">
<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 10 - Restrictions on the use of substances having hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists</h3>

<p>The aim of these requirements is to stop the illegal use of substances that have a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists in stock farming. They also prevent residues that these substances leave in meat - and other foodstuffs - from entering the human or animal food chain.</p>

<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 12, 13, 14 and 15 for the prevention and control of animal disease</h3>

<p>The aim of <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 12, 13, 14 and 15 is to minimise the risk posed to human and animal health by certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (<abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr>), foot and mouth, bluetongue and other animal diseases. These will apply to you if you keep cattle.</p>

<h2 id="critical-illnesses-of-cattle">Critical illnesses of cattle</h2>

<p>Looking after your animals properly and monitoring them regularly for signs of illness are the best ways of preventing disease, and of controlling its spread if there is an outbreak.</p>

<p>If you suspect signs of a notifiable disease, you must immediately notify the duty vet at your local Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>). </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the Defra website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Cattle are vulnerable to many endemic and exotic diseases, some of which might be notified to the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> if suspected:</p>

<ul>
<li>endemic diseases are diseases which commonly exist within Great Britain, eg common diseases such as Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (<abbr title="Bovine Viral Diarrhoea">BVD</abbr>), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (<abbr title="Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis">IBR</abbr>) and Johne’s disease. They can be both notifiable - those that the law requires to be reported to the veterinary authorities - and non-notifiable.</li>
  <li>notifiable diseases can be both endemic, such as tuberculosis, and exotic, meaning that they are not normally found in Great Britain, such as foot and mouth and bluetongue. Outbreaks of these diseases are subject to national control policies and international trade rules. They must be reported immediately to the duty vet at your local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr>. </li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 id="endemic-diseases">Endemic diseases</h3>

<p>The most important endemic diseases to check for in cattle are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Bovine Viral Diarrhoea">BVD</abbr> and BVD2 </li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis">IBR</abbr> </li>
  <li>Johne’s disease</li>
  <li>certain forms of tuberculosis</li>
  <li>salmonella</li>
  <li>mastitis</li>
  <li>other viral, bacterial and mycoplasma pneumonia</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notifiable-diseases">Notifiable diseases</h3>

<p>The main notifiable diseases which affect cattle are:</p>

<ul>
<li>anthrax</li>
  <li>Aujesky’s disease</li>
  <li>bluetongue</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)</li>
  <li>brucellosis (brucella abortus)</li>
  <li>contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia</li>
  <li>EBL (enzootic bovine leukosis)</li>
  <li>foot and mouth disease</li>
  <li>lumpy-skin disease</li>
  <li>pleuropneumonia</li>
  <li>rabies</li>
  <li>rift-valley fever</li>
  <li>rinderpest</li>
  <li>bovine tuberculosis</li>
  <li>vesicular stomatitis</li>
  <li>warble fly</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find factsheets on diseases and how to identify them via the A-Z of diseases on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/index.htm">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) website.</a></p>

<h2 id="disease-prevention-and-control-for-cattle">Disease prevention and control for cattle</h2>

<p>Monitoring your livestock and following good farming practices are the best ways to reduce the risk of disease among your cattle. </p>

<h3 id="buying-registering-identifying-and-moving-cattle">Buying, registering, identifying and moving cattle</h3>

<p>There are rules which you must follow for registering cattle, and when moving them. These procedures make it easier to trace and identify infected animals in the event of a disease outbreak.</p>

<p>When restocking your herd, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>consult your vet to help you develop a plan for evaluating prospective purchases</li>
  <li>buy health scheme animals - whenever possible - that have been certified as free of specific diseases</li>
  <li>recognise the risks in buying older animals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="biosecurity-and-hygiene">Biosecurity and hygiene</h3>

<p>Good biosecurity is a vital part of keeping disease away from your animals. This will also protect the health of your workers and any members of the public who may visit your farm.</p>

<p>Your general biosecurity measures should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>restricting and controlling movements of people, vehicles and equipment into areas where your cattle are kept</li>
  <li>cleaning and disinfecting equipment, vehicles, protective clothing and footwear before and after contact with farm animals</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of a disease may not always be apparent - particularly in the early stages - so the measures above need to be part of your routine.</p>

<p>Read more about biosecurity, including special rules for agricultural markets and shows, in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/disease-prevention-for-livestock-farmers">disease prevention</a>.</p>

<h3 id="health-and-welfare-programmes">Health and welfare programmes</h3>

<p>You should seek veterinary and technical advice to create a written health and welfare programme for your cattle. This should be reviewed and updated annually. As a minimum, it should include your:</p>

<ul>
<li>vaccination policy and timing</li>
  <li>parasite control procedures - internal and external</li>
</ul>
<p>Drugs are useful for preventing disease in cattle, but you must use them responsibly and record all usage. </p>

<p>You can reduce the risk of disease and improve the performance of your livestock by using farm health planning techniques. Find out about farm health planning for cattle on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/fhp/cattle.htm">Defra website.</a></p>

<p>One good way to improve health planning is to benchmark your cattle’s health and business practices against other local farmers.</p>

<h3 id="veterinary-surveillance">Veterinary surveillance</h3>

<p>As part of its disease prevention strategy, Defra constantly collects information about incidences of disease in animals. This monitoring enables any important or unusual outbreaks to be detected quickly - so that appropriate action can be taken.</p>

<p>Read about veterinary surveillance on the <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/vetsurveillance/info.htm">Defra website.</a></p>

<h3 id="the-single-payment-scheme-and-farmed-animal-requirements">The Single Payment Scheme and farmed animal requirements</h3>

<p>If you receive <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> or other direct payments, you must comply with <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>. <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirement">SMR</abbr> 7, for example, sets out the requirements for cattle identification and registration whereas <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> 10-15 are about disease prevention through the feeding and medicinal treatment restrictions set out in this guide.</p>

<p>You can find information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> relevant to you on the <a rel="external" href="http://rpa.defra.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/56A9622E04E38684802573B1002EF010">RPA website.</a></p>

<h2 id="disposal-of-fallen-stock">Disposal of fallen stock</h2>

<p>‘Fallen stock’ is any animal that has died of natural causes or disease on a farm or that has been killed on a farm for reasons other than for human consumption.</p>

<p>You are not permitted to bury or burn fallen stock on farm due to the risk of spreading disease through residues in the soil, groundwater or air pollution. This ban also covers animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>), including afterbirth and stillborn animals.</p>

<p>The only exceptions to this ban are:</p>

<h3 id="rules-for-bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy-testing-fallen-cattle">Rules for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy testing fallen cattle</h3>

<p><abbr title="bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> is part of a family of diseases known as <abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr>. These are fatal brain diseases, which include classical and atypical scrapie in sheep and goats, and <abbr title="bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> in cattle.</p>

<p>You should test for <abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr> in your fallen cattle to assess the level of these diseases in your animals. This will enable you to assess how effective disease control measures would be and help you to ensure any controls are proportionate to the risk.</p>

<p>Fallen stock must be tested for <abbr title="bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> if they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>over 48 months of age</li>
  <li>over 24 months of age and born outside the European Union</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners in the UK must contact a collector within 24 hours of their animal’s death, to arrange delivery to an approved sampling site within 72 hours of the animal’s death. If you are delivering the carcass yourself, you must contact an approved sampling site to agree this within 24 hours and you must deliver the carcass within 72 hours of the animal’s death.</p>

<p>You must also contact your local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> immediately if you think an animal has died of a notifiable disease. </p>

<p>Fallen cattle aged 48 months or under should be disposed of in accordance with <abbr title="animal by-product">ABP</abbr> legislation.</p>

<p>You can find approved premises for TSE testing on the <a rel="external" href="http://vla.defra.gov.uk/services/ser_bse_lab_approvals.htm#approved">Veterinary Laboratories Agency website.</a></p>

<p>Animal carcasses or parts of animal carcasses suspected or confirmed as infected by a TSE are category 1 <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> - the highest risk category. They must be disposed of by incineration, or processing (rendering) followed by incineration. You can find out about destroying TSE-infected carcasses and specified risk material in the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/keeping-livestock-healthy-disease-controls-and-prevention">keeping livestock healthy - disease controls, prevention, notification and restrictions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prevention-and-control-of-brucellosis-and-tses-in-cattle">Prevention and control of brucellosis and <abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr> in cattle</h2>

<p>Cattle farmers must take steps to minimise the risk posed to human and animal health by brucellosis and (<abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr>, such as <abbr title="bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> and its human variant.</p>

<h3 id="prevention-and-control-of-brucellosis">Prevention and control of brucellosis</h3>

<p>Brucellosis of cattle, known as contagious abortion, is caused by infection with the bacterium ‘Brucella abortus’, which can also infect people. Cases have been recorded in this country recently - despite its eradication from the UK - through the movement of infected cattle from other countries. You should therefore work out proper biosecurity with your vet before you bring imported cattle on-farm.</p>

<p>The disease causes abortion - or early calving - of recently infected animals, with large amounts of infectious material produced. The bacterium is also excreted in milk. People can become infected by drinking untreated milk and by contact with infected animals. The bacterium is destroyed when milk is pasteurised.</p>

<p>All abortions in cattle, which occur at a certain stage of pregnancy, should be reported to the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. The law requires cattle keepers to report every abortion or premature calving to the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. An abortion or premature calving takes place less than 271 days after service or 265 days after implantation - or transfer of an embryo - whether the calf is born dead or alive.</p>

<p>Although blood tests for brucellosis are no longer carried out routinely on beef cattle, the following surveillance and risk management measures continue to apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>import controls and certification</li>
  <li>exporting country alerts of brucellosis breakdowns in exporting herds</li>
  <li>post-import check testing</li>
  <li>post-calving check testing</li>
  <li>abortion reporting and investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any suspicion of this notifiable disease, you must contact the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> immediately. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the Defra website</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Treatment for brucellosis of cattle is not permitted - all infected cattle as well as cattle that have been exposed to infection must be slaughtered.</p>

<p>If the disease is suspected, <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Officers have the right to serve a notice on the owner or person in charge of the affected bovine animals to ban their movement from their current premises or require their movement to other premises. Where a notice applies, no manure, slurry or other animal waste can be removed from those premises except under a specific licence.</p>

<h3 id="prevention-and-control-of-tse">Prevention and control of TSE</h3>

<p>To reduce the risk of <abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr>, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>not feed animal protein or any feeds containing animal protein to cattle, sheep, goats, camelids, bison, buffalo, deer, antelope and wildebeest - except for milk, milk-based and colostrums, eggs and egg products, gelatine from non-ruminants, hydrolysed proteins derived from non-ruminants or from ruminant hides and skins, and liquid milk replacers for unweaned ruminants containing fishmeal, if registered by Defra</li>
  <li>not use feed products containing prohibited proteins or mix prohibited proteins with feeding stuffs such as bonemeal or poultry meal</li>
  <li>not use restricted proteins to produce feed for non-ruminants such as pigs and poultry - unless you have received authorisation from Defra</li>
  <li>not use feed products containing restricted proteins on a farm where there are ruminant species present - unless you have received registration from Defra</li>
  <li>notify the duty vet at your local <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> immediately if you know or suspect that an animal or carcass in your possession - or under your charge - is infected with a TSE</li>
  <li>fully comply with any movement restrictions</li>
  <li>fully comply with any order to slaughter and destroy any animal</li>
  <li>fully comply with any other notices served by an inspector</li>
</ul>
<p>There are specific rules to prevent the spread of <abbr title="bovine spongiform encephalopathy">BSE</abbr> and other <abbr title="transmissible spongiform encephalopathies">TSEs</abbr> through the use of animal by-products in animal feed.</p>

<h2 id="prevention-and-control-of-tuberculosis-in-cattle">Prevention and control of tuberculosis in cattle</h2>

<p>Bovine tuberculosis (<abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr>) is a pressing animal health issue. The incidence rate of <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> in cattle in England and Wales has been rising for 25 years and has worsened since the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak. The disease is a largely regional problem, concentrated in England in the South West and West Midlands.</p>

<p>As the disease can spread to humans through contaminated milk and dairy products it is unlawful for milk - raw or pasteurised - from any animal testing positive for <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> to be used for human consumption. Milk from the rest of the herd can still be sold for human consumption - as long as it’s heat-treated.</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>Cattle with <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> are most often identified through testing using the tuberculin skin test before they develop clinical signs. This is because the disease usually progresses slowly and it can take some time for clinical signs to appear. Clinical signs of advanced <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>weakness</li>
  <li>emaciation</li>
  <li>difficulty breathing</li>
  <li>enlarged lymph nodes</li>
  <li>coughing</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/animals/diseases/tb/">Read information about <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> on the Defra website</a>.</p>

<p>You must notify the veterinary manager of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> immediately if you know or suspect that an animal or carcass in your possession - or under your charge - is infected with <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr>.</p>

<p>All cattle herds in Great Britain - except some beef fattening units - are regularly tested for <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr>, as part of four different testing programmes:</p>

<ul>
<li>compulsory regular testing  using the tuberculin skin test - carried out at the Government’s expense every one to four years, with the frequency determined by how widespread <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> is in a particular region</li>
  <li>Gamma interferon blood testing - in the circumstances outlined below.</li>
  <li>high health risk testing - additional annual tests where there is a potentially higher risk to public or animal health, eg producers of raw drinking milk, unpasteurised dairy products, dealers’ herds, bull hirers and regular buyers of Irish cattle</li>
  <li>pre-movement testing - compulsory tests before cattle aged 42 days or more can be moved from a high risk area</li>
  <li>post-mortem testing - inspection carried out by the Meat Hygiene Service on all cattle at slaughterhouses, which enables <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> cases to be traced back to the herd of origin</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tuberculin-skin-test">Tuberculin skin test</h3>

<p>The tuberculin skin test is the primary screening method for <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> in Great Britain. This test is used throughout the world to screen cattle, other animals and people for TB. Testing is carried out by government-approved testers and supervised by government-approved vets. Each test has three possible outcomes:</p>

<ul>
<li>positive - the reactor animal is isolated from the rest of the herd and slaughtered</li>
  <li>inconclusive - the animal is re-tested</li>
  <li>negative</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gamma-interferon-blood-test">Gamma interferon blood test</h3>

<p>The more sensitive gamma interferon (<abbr title="gamma interferon">g-IFN</abbr>) diagnostic blood test is used in prescribed circumstances alongside the tuberculin skin test, to improve the sensitivity of the testing regime and identify more infected animals more quickly. Using both tests in this way can help to speed up the resolution of confirmed TB breakdowns by identifying as many infected cattle as possible at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>The use of <abbr title="gamma interferon">g-IFN</abbr> test is mandatory in the following prescribed circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>all confirmed new incidents (CNI) in 3 or 4 yearly tested herds, including those that fail to resolve through repeated skin testing or where complete or partial de-population is contemplated</li>
  <li>confirmed TB incidents that have failed to resolve through repeated skin testing, in 1 and 2 yearly tested herds, including those herds where complete or partial de-population is contemplated</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the test is used occasionally to enhance specificity in the following limited circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>non-specific reactor procedure for unconfirmed breakdowns in 2, 3, or 4 yearly tested herds</li>
  <li>suspected fraudulent reactors</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pre-movement-testing">Pre-Movement testing</h3>

<p>In addition to the above, Pre-Movement testing is a statutory requirement: cattle 42 days old and over moving from a 1 or 2 yearly tested herd must have tested negative to a <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> test within 60 days prior to movement.</p>

<h3 id="cattle-compensation">Cattle Compensation</h3>

<p>Government compensation is paid to owners of cattle compulsorily slaughtered for <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr> control purposes. Compensation in England is determined primarily using table values, which reflect the average sales price of bovine animals in 47 different categories. The categories are based on the animal’s age, gender, type (dairy or beef) and status (pedigree or non-pedigree).</p>

<h3 id="vaccination">Vaccination</h3>

<p>Vaccination of either cattle or wildlife is a potential long-term option for reducing the risk of bovine TB in Great Britain. However, vaccines can never represent a single answer to the problem of bovine TB. Vaccination is a risk reduction measure, most likely to be successful in controlling bovine TB when used alongside other disease control.</p>

<p>The first injectable badger vaccine was licensed in March 2010 and is available for use on prescription. Research is continuing into producing a licensed cattle vaccine with differential test and an oral badger vaccine.</p>

<h3 id="badgers-and-btb">Badgers and <abbr title="Bovine tuberculosis">bTB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Following consultations in 2010 and 2011, Ministers announced in December 2011 that they will allow controlled culling to be carried out by groups of farmers and landowners, as part of a science-led and carefully managed policy of badger control. Licences will be issued by Natural England under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 to enable groups of farmers and landowners in the worst affected areas, to reduce badger populations for the purpose of preventing the spread of disease at their own expense.</p>

<p>Culling will be piloted of the policy in two areas in 2012 to monitor the effectiveness, humaneness and safety of controlled shooting. Subject to Natural England’s decisions on licence applications, the two areas will be West Gloucestershire and West Somerset.</p>

<p>An independent panel of experts has been appointed to report to ministers on the findings of the monitoring of the badger culling pilots by the end of 2012. If Ministers decide to proceed following the pilots, a maximum of ten licences will be granted to start each year.</p>

<p>A five-year Badger Vaccine Deployment Project (<abbr title="Badger Vaccine Deployment Project">BVDP</abbr>) is taking place in one area of Gloucestershire, near Stroud.

<h2 id="protecting-cattle-from-lead-poisoning-on-farms">Protecting cattle from lead poisoning on farms</h2>

<p>Lead poisoning can cost you money and kill your cattle. The highest incidence usually occurs immediately after turn out when animals discover lead-containing materials abandoned on the pasture.</p>

<p>Accumulation of lead beyond legal limits renders meat, offal and milk unsafe and illegal to enter the food chain. Lead poisoning can also result in stunted animal growth, animal deaths, increased birth defects and infertility, decreased productivity, loss of market value and disposal costs for dead animals and vet fees.</p>

<h3 id="causes-of-lead-poisoning-on-farms">Causes of lead poisoning on farms</h3>

<p>The most frequent causes of lead poisoning in cattle are:</p>

<ul>
<li>flaking high lead paint - mainly calves</li>
  <li>vehicle and electric fence batteries - eg battery remains accidentally mixed with animal feed, or batteries fly-tipped on farm land</li>
  <li>high lead soils - usually arising from historic mining and smelting operations, land erosion - especially by water courses but occasionally landslips</li>
  <li>ash from fires in which lead materials were burned such as painted woodwork, leaded building materials, putty, wiring</li>
  <li>lead shot from shooting which can be eaten with soil uptake and can also contaminate certain crops, especially maize and end up in silage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="withdrawal-periods-and-offal-removal">Withdrawal periods and offal removal</h3>

<p>A 16-week withdrawal period before slaughter is usually sufficient but for lead which is retained in the stomach this can extend for several years. Some animals may show no signs of poisoning but have lead residues in milk, offal and meat. Offal tends to have higher levels of lead for longer periods than meat or milk.</p>

<p>Animals and/or their produce may need to be tested to investigate whether lead residues are present and also to monitor whether a withdrawal period has been adequate or whether offal should be removed after slaughter.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-avoid-lead-contamination-on-your-farm">How to avoid lead contamination on your farm</h3>

<p>There are several steps you can take to protect your cattle and the human food chain from lead contamination. You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>check your fields and barns for vehicle batteries, building materials, flaking lead paint, putty, lead flashing</li>
  <li>remove or fence off fly-tipped material</li>
  <li>prevent access to burnt out cars and old machinery that might contain lead</li>
  <li>prevent cattle access to bonfire ash</li>
</ul>
<p>On farms with high lead soils, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep your cows’ soil consumption as low as possible</li>
  <li>avoid waterlogged land and poached land for grazing</li>
  <li>avoid overgrazing and maintain adequate sward height</li>
  <li>fence off bare areas of soil</li>
  <li>calibrate cutters when making silage to minimise soil uptake</li>
  <li>flatten any molehills prior to cutting grass for silage</li>
  <li>provide salt licks and mineral supplements</li>
  <li>use mains water or tested borehole water rather than natural run-off water from high lead soils</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-do-if-you-suspect-lead-poisoning-in-your-cattle">What to do if you suspect lead poisoning in your cattle</h3>

<p>If you suspect some of your cows are contaminated with lead, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>remove your cattle from the affected area (pasture, pen or yard) immediately</li>
  <li>consult your vet</li>
  <li>confirm the cause of disease and if it is lead poisoning then investigate the source</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cattle-feed">Cattle feed</h2>

<p>Safe, good-quality foodstuffs are essential to maintain both human and animal health.</p>

<p>Feed contaminants such as lead or antimicrobial residues - or biological agents such as botulism - may cause disease in cattle and make their produce unsuitable for human consumption.</p>

<p>You must ensure you do not give unsafe feed to food-producing animals. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/food-safety-farmed-meat-farm-produce-and-animal-feed">farmed animal food and feed law</a>.</p>

<h3 id="animal-by-products-as-foodstuffs">Animal by-products as foodstuffs</h3>

<p>You can use some former foodstuffs - food previously intended for human consumption - as livestock feed, subject to the animal by-products regulations.</p>

<p>Former foodstuffs that can be fed to cattle include:</p>

<ul>
<li>milk and milk-based products</li>
  <li>biscuits</li>
  <li>bakery waste</li>
  <li>pasta</li>
  <li>chocolate</li>
  <li>sweets and similar products</li>
</ul>
<p>Such products can contain rennet, melted fat, milk or eggs, as long as they are not the main ingredients. You must ensure that the products are not contaminated by meat or other animal products before feeding them to cattle.</p>

<p>You must not feed meat, fish and most other products of animal origin to ruminants, pigs or poultry, or allow them access to such material. Cattle should not be fed any processed or unprocessed catering waste, even if it comes from vegetarian restaurants and kitchens.</p>

<h2 id="hormonal-treatments-and-antibiotics-for-cattle">Hormonal treatments and antibiotics for cattle</h2>

<p>Due to concerns about the potential risk to humans, the use of hormonal growth promoters for livestock is banned in the UK. Antibiotic growth-promoting feed additives have also been phased out - because of concerns about the potential spread of antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p>As a result, if you keep farmed animals there are restrictions on the use of treatments that:</p>

<ul>
<li>act as beta-agonists</li>
  <li>have hormonal actions</li>
  <li>reduce production of thyroid hormones</li>
</ul>
<p>You must prevent meat containing these substances from entering the human - or animal - food chain.</p>

<p>Restricted treatments include:</p>

<ul>
<li>phenylbutazone</li>
  <li>tetracyclines</li>
  <li>sulphonamides</li>
  <li>nalidixic acid</li>
  <li>fusidic acid</li>
  <li>florphenicol</li>
  <li>ceftriaxone</li>
</ul>
<p>Restricted antibiotic substances include:</p>

<ul>
<li>chloramphenicol</li>
  <li>ampicillin</li>
  <li>amoxycillin/clavulanate</li>
  <li>neomycin</li>
  <li>gentamicin</li>
  <li>enrofloxacin</li>
  <li>tiamulin</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>give food-producing animals restricted substances unless with any permitted exceptions</li>
  <li>use substances containing oestradiol 17ß or its ester-like derivatives</li>
  <li>use substances that contain beta-agonists to slow a labour - tocolysis - in cows when calving</li>
  <li>use substances containing hormones or thyroid hormone-reducing actions unless prescribed by your veterinary surgeon</li>
  <li>have food-producing animals on your farm that have been given any restricted substance, unless there are permitted exceptions</li>
  <li>send animals to slaughter that have been given any restricted substances, unless there are permitted exceptions</li>
  <li>sell meat or any other animal product that has been given a restricted substance</li>
</ul>
<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>observe the relevant withdrawal period - ie the period between the end of treatment and the slaughter of the animal - if your food-producing animals have been given any of the restricted substances - see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-livestock-veterinary-medicines">managing livestock veterinary medicines</a> </li>
  <li>keep veterinary medicinal records relating to restricted substances available to the competent authority on request</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cattle-inspections-and-record-keeping">Cattle inspections and record keeping</h2>

<p>In taking responsibility for your herd, you must have the skills needed to safeguard the animals’ health and welfare. This includes being familiar with the welfare code for that species. For stock management advice relating to welfare, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/cattle-welfare-regulations">cattle welfare</a>.</p>

<p>Regular inspection of your herd is essential to maintain good health. You should be familiar with the normal behaviour of cattle and be alert for any signs of illness or distress.</p>

<h3 id="monitoring-cattle">Monitoring cattle</h3>

<p>Signs of ill health in your cattle include:</p>

<ul>
<li>listlessness</li>
  <li>separation from the group</li>
  <li>unusual behaviour</li>
  <li>loss of body condition</li>
  <li>loss of appetite</li>
  <li>a sudden fall in milk yield</li>
  <li>constipation</li>
  <li>scouring (diarrhoea)</li>
  <li>not cudding</li>
  <li>discharge from the nostrils or eyes</li>
  <li>increased saliva production</li>
  <li>persistent coughing</li>
  <li>rapid or irregular breathing</li>
  <li>abnormal resting behaviour</li>
  <li>swollen joints</li>
  <li>lameness</li>
  <li>mastitis</li>
</ul>
<p>You should aim to recognise problems in their earliest stages - so that you can identify the cause and take immediate action to resolve the issue. If the cause isn’t apparent - or if your remedy proves ineffective - you should seek urgent advice from a vet or other expert.</p>

<p>If you have any suspicion of a notifiable disease, you must contact your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> immediately. </p>

<h3 id="record-keeping">Record-keeping</h3>

<p>You must keep a record of all mortalities that occur among your herd, as well as any medicinal treatment given to your animals. These records need to be kept for at least three years.</p>

<p>You should only use authorised animal medicines. Your records should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the name and address of the medicine supplier</li>
  <li>the date you treated the animals</li>
  <li>which animal or group of animals you treated</li>
  <li>how much medicine you used</li>
</ul>
<p>Although it’s not a legal requirement, you may also find it useful to keep a record of specific cases of - and treatment given for - certain disorders. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>mastitis</li>
  <li>lameness</li>
  <li>milk fever</li>
</ul>
