<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Waste and hazardous substances from businesses in the metal production and processing industry can cause pollution if they are not dealt with correctly. Metal production and processing includes manufacturing ferrous, non-ferrous and precious metals and alloys; metal forming processes; bar, wire and tube drawing; and metal casting.</p>

<p>Producers must comply with their duty of care when disposing of waste, including off-cuts, slags, sludges, lubricating fluids, and baghouse and electrostatic precipitator waste. If you use hazardous substances such as solvents, you must store, handle and dispose of them correctly. Using hazardous substances efficiently can help you reduce waste and minimise costs.</p>

<p>This guide explains your responsibilities for dealing with waste, including hazardous waste. It also describes your legal obligations if you use or deal with hazardous substances such as solvents, oil, chemicals and polychlorinated biphenyls.</p>

<h2 id="waste-responsibilities-for-metal-producers">Waste responsibilities for metal producers</h2>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that controlled waste you produce, store, treat, transport or dispose of does not harm the environment. This is called your duty of care.</p>

<p>Controlled waste is commercial, industrial and household waste, and may include hazardous waste, agricultural, construction and demolition waste.</p>

<p>Waste materials that metal production and processing are likely to produce include:</p>

<ul>
<li>off-cuts and swarf (shavings or chippings of metal)</li>
  <li>used oil emulsions and greases</li>
  <li>sludges and slags from furnaces</li>
  <li>old refractory linings</li>
  <li>dust from baghouses and electrostatic precipitators</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="check-if-you-need-a-permit-licence-or-exemption">Check if you need a permit, licence or exemption</h3>

<p>You must have an environmental permit or registered waste exemption from the Environment Agency to use, store, collect, treat, recover, dismantle, recycle, burn or otherwise dispose of waste.</p>

<p>In some cases you may not need to register an exemption but you will still need to comply with the terms of an exemption. For example, you can usually store your own waste where it was produced temporarily, while you wait for it to be removed from your site.</p>

<p>Exemptions from environmental permitting may apply to your business if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>heat iron, steel, ferrous alloys, non-ferrous metals or non-ferrous metal alloys to remove grease, oil or any other non-metallic contaminant, and the combined net rated thermal input of the furnace (or furnaces) is less than 0.2 megawatts</li>
  <li>operate a scrap metal furnace with a designed holding capacity of less than 25 tonnes</li>
</ul>
<p>See the guide on environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production.</p>

<h3 id="apply-the-waste-management-hierarchy">Apply the waste management hierarchy</h3>

<p>You must apply the waste management hierarchy when you transfer waste. This means you must consider reusing or recycling your waste before deciding to dispose of it. </p>

<p>See the guide on how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1081267120">save money by reducing, reusing and recycling waste.</a></p>

<p>If you have an environmental permit for an operation which generates waste, you will have to apply the waste management hierarchy. This will be a condition of new environmental permits, and will be added to existing permits when they are reviewed.  </p>

<h3 id="use-authorised-businesses-to-deal-with-your-waste">Use authorised businesses to deal with your waste</h3>

<p>If your waste is collected by a waste carrier, broker or dealer you must check that they are registered or exempt from registration. Ask to see their certificate of registration or a certified copy. If you do not check and keep proof of this you could be held responsible if your waste is disposed of illegally, for example by fly-tipping. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1079431917">duty of care - your waste responsibilities.</a></p>

<p>If you take your own waste to another site you must check that the site has the appropriate environmental permit or registered exemption for your type of waste.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www2.environment-agency.gov.uk/epr/index.asp?lang=_e">Check if your waste carrier is registered on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.wastedirectory.org.uk/">Find licensed waste sites on the NetRegs Waste Directory website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="check-if-you-need-to-register-as-a-waste-carrier">Check if you need to register as a waste carrier</h3>

<p>You can transport most waste produced by your own business directly to an authorised waste management site or recycling facility without being registered.</p>

<p>You must register with the Environment Agency as a waste carrier if you transport:</p>

<ul>
<li>construction and demolition waste produced by your own business</li>
  <li>any waste produced by another business</li>
</ul>
<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1086989345">waste carriers, brokers and dealers.</a></p>

<h3 id="use-waste-transfer-notes">Use waste transfer notes</h3>

<p>You must have a waste transfer note (<abbr title="waste transfer note">WTN</abbr>) for every load of waste you pass on or accept. <abbr title="waste transfer notes">WTNs</abbr> must be completed and signed by both the person sending the waste and the person receiving the waste. You must keep copies of all your <abbr title="waste transfer notes">WTNs</abbr> for at least two years.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1079431917">duty of care - your waste responsibilities.</a></p>

<h3 id="pre-treat-waste-for-landfill">Pre-treat waste for landfill</h3>

<p>You must make sure that your waste is treated before it goes to a landfill site. This applies to most types of waste. You can either treat your waste yourself or make sure that a later holder of the waste will treat it before they send it to a landfill site. </p>

<h3 id="follow-hazardous-waste-controls">Follow hazardous waste controls</h3>

<p>You must check if you have hazardous waste that may be harmful to human health or the environment. Most businesses produce some hazardous waste, such as fluorescent tubes, computer monitors, cleaning and degreasing solvents, wastes contaminated with metals or chemicals.</p>

<p>You must comply with additional legal requirements for hazardous waste. </p>

<h3 id="prevent-pollution-from-spills-of-waste">Prevent pollution from spills of waste</h3>

<p>You must ensure that you don’t cause pollution when you store and transport your waste. Separate different waste materials and store them in covered, waterproof containers with clear labels.</p>

<p>Prepare a pollution incident response plan. Ensure accidental spills can be contained. Keep spill kits at your site and portable spill kits in vehicles used to transport waste materials. See the guide on how to prevent pollution from metal production.</p>

<h2 id="hazardous-waste-responsibilities">Hazardous waste responsibilities</h2>

<p>Metals production businesses produce hazardous waste, which is harmful to human health and the environment.</p>

<p>Materials and substances from metals production and processing that may be hazardous waste include:</p>

<ul>
<li>sludges, eg from cooling tanks</li>
  <li>swarf that is contaminated with cutting fluid or oil</li>
  <li>oil and oil emulsions</li>
  <li>greases</li>
  <li>acids and alkaline solutions</li>
  <li>solvents used for degreasing scrap and cleaning boilers</li>
  <li>sand from casting processes that is contaminated with metals or chemicals</li>
  <li>pollution containment equipment that has been used on spills of hazardous materials</li>
  <li>computer monitors</li>
  <li>fluorescent tubes</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/GEHO0603BIRB-e-e.pdf">Download guidance on assessing whether waste is hazardous from the Environment Agency website. (PDF, 545KB)</a></p>

<h3 id="identifying-hazardous-waste">Identifying hazardous waste</h3>

<p>If the waste you produce has hazardous properties, you may need to deal with it as hazardous waste. You will find information that can help you make this decision on safety data sheets and product labels. Safety data sheets contain information about substances, including how to store, use and dispose of them safely.</p>

<p>If you intend to discard containers, you must assess whether they are hazardous waste. Containers may need to be classified as hazardous waste if they contain residues of hazardous or dangerous substances or materials. If the residue is hazardous, the whole container will be hazardous waste.</p>

<h3 id="using-and-keeping-copies-of-paperwork">Using and keeping copies of paperwork</h3>

<p>If your business produces hazardous waste, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>use consignment notes whenever the waste is moved to another location, and keep copies for three years</li>
  <li>keep copies of return to producer forms for three years (these are records of what has happened to your waste)</li>
  <li>check whether you need to register annually with the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>comply with your duty of care for waste</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="storing-hazardous-waste-safely">Storing hazardous waste safely</h3>

<p>You must check if the waste you store is hazardous waste before you store it.</p>

<p>You must store hazardous waste securely and separately from all other waste materials. You must use containers that are sealed, labelled, covered and waterproof.</p>

<p>If you store hazardous waste you may need to comply with the conditions of a waste exemption or you may need an environmental permit.</p>

<h3 id="transporting-hazardous-waste-safely">Transporting hazardous waste safely</h3>

<p>You can currently carry your own hazardous waste without registering as a waste carrier, unless it is construction or demolition waste. You must still complete a consignment note. However, from the end of December 2013 you will have to register with the Environment Agency as a lower tier waste carrier if you normally and regularly carry your own business waste.</p>

<p>If you carry hazardous waste produced by other businesses, or your own construction or demolition waste, you must usually register as an upper tier waste carrier. If you had a waste carrier certificate before 29 March 2011, it will be classified as an upper tier registration. When your certificate is due to be renewed it will be replaced with an upper tier certificate. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1086989345">waste carriers, brokers and dealers.</a></p>

<p>If you pass your waste to someone else to transport for you, you must ensure that they are a registered or exempt waste carrier. <a rel="external" href="http://www2.environment-agency.gov.uk/epr/index.asp?lang=_e">Check if your waste carrier is registered on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-hazardous-waste-correctly">Disposing of hazardous waste correctly</h3>

<p>You must ensure that your hazardous waste is disposed of and treated at an appropriate facility. You should recover and recycle your hazardous waste wherever possible.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>Look for alternative materials and practices that do not produce, or produce less, hazardous waste.</p>

<p>Refine your processes to minimise the amount of sand that you use, and reuse as much as possible. You may be able to send sand for recycling in cement, asphalt and concrete blocks. See the guide on efficient design and resource use in metal production.</p>

<p>Provide written instructions for storing and disposing of each type of hazardous waste produced on your premises. Ensure that all employees and contractors follow these instructions.</p>

<p>For more information see the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1080466581">managing your hazardous waste.</a></p>

<h2 id="weee-obligations">
<abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> obligations</h2>

<p>Waste electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>) is the fastest growing type of waste in the UK. You must handle and store it correctly and ensure that it is treated, recycled or disposed of at an authorised facility. Where possible you should reuse <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Common types of <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>computers and other office equipment</li>
  <li>fluorescent light tubes</li>
  <li>fridges</li>
  <li>vending machines</li>

<h3 id="dealing-with-weee-correctly">Dealing with <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> correctly</h3>

<p>Your business must store, collect, treat, recycle and dispose of <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> separately from other waste.</p>

<p>You must get and keep proof that you gave your <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> to an authorised waste management company, and that they treated and disposed of it without harming the environment.</p>

<p>You may be able to use a free take-back scheme for <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> funded by the equipment manufacturer.</p>

<p>If your business manufactures, rebrands, imports, distributes or sells electrical or electronic equipment you may have to comply with additional requirements under the <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1082900279"><abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>.</a></p>

<p>You must comply with your duty of care responsibilities when dealing with <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="Waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> contains hazardous substances, you will need to treat it as hazardous waste. This includes fluorescent light tubes and televisions that contain cathode ray tubes. </p>

<h3 id="good-practice-1">Good practice</h3>

<p>You can reduce your waste management costs and help the environment by reusing or recycling your electrical and electronic equipment wherever possible. See the guide on how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1081267120">save money by reducing, reusing and recycling waste.</a></p>

<h2 id="fuel-and-oil-use-responsibilities">Fuel and oil use responsibilities</h2>

<p>If your business produces or processes metal, you need to know your requirements for safely using and storing oil and fuel. Leaks and spills cause pollution, so it is essential that you store and handle fuels and oil safely. Fuels include petrol, diesel, oil and liquid petroleum gas (<abbr title="liquid petroleum gas">LPG</abbr>).</p>

<p>You may use oils in your metals production and processing business as:</p>

<ul>
<li>a fuel</li>
  <li>lubricating oil for machinery</li>
  <li>a solvent, eg paraffin or kerosene</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="storing-oil-safely">Storing oil safely</h3>

<p>If you store any kind of oil on your premises, you may need to comply with a number of regulations controlling its storage. This will depend on how much and what type of oil you store, the type of site you have and the containers you use.</p>

<p>Even if oil storage controls do not apply, you should still store your oils responsibly and consider meeting the requirements of the legislation. This can help you to prevent land and water pollution and avoid prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-major-accidents">Preventing major accidents</h3>

<p>If you store or use dangerous substances, such as petroleum products or <abbr title="liquid petroleum gas">LPG</abbr>, on your site, you may need to comply with the Control of Major Accident Hazards (<abbr title="Control of Major Accident Hazards">COMAH</abbr>) Regulations.</p>

<p>For example, if you store more than 2,500 tonnes of petroleum products, you must have a major accident prevention policy. If you store more than 25,000 tonnes of petroleum products you must also submit a safety report and prepare an on-site emergency plan.</p>

<h3 id="supervising-refuelling">Supervising refuelling</h3>

<p>Supervise all fuel deliveries to your site.  Clearly label all tanks with their contents and storage capacity. You should also label remote filling points. This will reduce the risk of overfilling and spills.</p>

<p>Use drip trays when you refuel mobile or temporary equipment, for example bowsers or generators, and at the fill point when refilling storage tanks. This may be a legal requirement. </p>

<p>Prevent water running off refuelling areas into surface water drains and general yard drainage by using drainage gullies, raised kerbs or appropriate falls. Drain this run-off via an oil separator. You may need permission from the Environment Agency or your water and sewerage company to discharge wastewater from your oil interceptor.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0406BIYL-e-e.pdf">Download Pollution prevention guideline: Use and design of oil separators in surface water drainage systems (PPG3) from the Environment Agency website. (PDF, 79KB)</a></p>

<p>Ensure your oil separator is properly maintained and works effectively. If your oil separator doesn’t work properly, you might cause pollution, and you could be prosecuted or fined.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-drainage-system-incidents">Preventing drainage system incidents</h3>

<p>Keep an up-to-date and accurate drainage plan of your site. This will help you identify the locations of all the drains and sewers and where they lead.</p>

<p>When making a discharge to a drain or sewer, always check you are connecting to the correct system. You should only discharge clean, uncontaminated surface water to the surface water drainage system.</p>

<p>Colour code your drainage system by painting manhole covers, gullies and grills using a recognised colour coding system - blue for surface water drains and red for foul water drains. This will help you to identify which system you are discharging to and where any spills will end up.</p>

<p>Install shut-off valves on your surface and foul water drainage lines so that you can isolate your site drainage if there is a major fuel spill.</p>

<p>Report any pollution incidents as soon as they happen to the Environment Agency Incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.</p>

<h2 id="chemical-and-reach-responsibilities">Chemical and <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> responsibilities</h2>

<p>You must store and handle chemicals safely to avoid pollution incidents and health risks. Regularly review the hazardous substances you use, make sure you follow any restriction or controls placed on them and where possible use less harmful alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="does-reach-apply-to-your-business">Does <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> apply to your business?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> regulation aims to protect human health and the environment through the control of chemical substances.</p>

<p>If you use, supply or manufacture chemical substances, or import them from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, it is likely <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> will affect you in some way.</p>

<p><abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> applies to a wide range of chemical substances on their own, and in preparations or mixtures including coatings, inks or dyes and cleaning products. Chemical substances used by metals production businesses that are affected by <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> include degreasers, solvents and sand treatment chemicals. <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> also applies to chemical substances contained in finished products or articles, whether you are manufacturing or supplying them within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, or importing them from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="chemical-users-requirements">Chemical users’ requirements</h3>

<p>You are a chemical user if as a part of your work you:</p>

<ul>
<li>use any chemicals or preparations</li>
  <li>use chemicals to formulate or blend preparations or mixtures</li>
  <li>use any chemicals, preparations or mixtures to produce articles</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a chemical substance, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify and follow all appropriate safety measures identified by the chemical’s safety data sheet</li>
  <li>use the substance within its safe exposure limits</li>
  <li>comply with any conditions of authorisation that have been placed on its use by <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>
</li>
  <li>not use it in a way that is restricted by <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should check that your suppliers register all the ways you use the chemicals they supply. If you have an unusual use for a substance, you should provide your suppliers with details of how you intend to use the chemical. This will allow them to include this information in their registration. If you do not want to tell your suppliers about your use for a chemical, you may have to carry out a chemical safety assessment for that substance, and submit your assessment directly to the European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>).</p>

<p>You should make an inventory or list of chemical substances that your business uses, supplies, manufactures or imports. This will help you understand your responsibilities and the impact <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> will have on your business activities. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/inventorydownstream.pdf">Download guidance on how to create an inventory of chemicals from the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website. (PDF, 97KB)</a></p>

<p>See the guide on REACH.</p>

<h3 id="substances-of-very-high-concern-and-restricted-chemicals-controls">Substances of very high concern and restricted chemicals controls</h3>

<p><abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> places controls on the supply and use of certain chemical substances on their own, in preparations or mixtures, or in articles. These apply to substances that can be particularly harmful to human health or the environment, for example those that are classified as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic.</p>

<p>There are three groups of chemicals that are specifically controlled under <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>the candidate list of substances of very high concern (<abbr title="substances of very high concern">SVHCs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Annex XIV substances - priority <abbr title="substances of very high concern">SVHCs</abbr> that require an authorisation for their supply and use</li>
  <li>Annex XVII substances - particular chemicals with restrictions on their supply and use</li>
</ul>
<p>If you supply or use a chemical substance, on its own, in preparations or mixtures or in articles, make sure that you meet any specific controls that apply to it.</p>

<p>You can email the UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> helpdesk for specific queries about <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals">REACH</abbr> at <a href="mailto:ukreachca@hse.gsi.gov.uk">ukreachca@hse.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You should store all chemicals safely, to avoid harming human health and the environment. </p>

<h2 id="solvent-emission-responsibilities">Solvent emission responsibilities</h2>

<p>Organic solvents are volatile organic compounds (<abbr title="volatile organic compounds">VOCs</abbr>), which are chemicals that easily vaporise at room temperature and may be harmful if inhaled. Metals production and processing businesses use solvents for a number of purposes including:</p>

<ul>
<li>chemical binding systems for making moulds</li>
  <li>cleaning recycled scrap metal before returning it to the furnace</li>
  <li>lubricants in die casting processes</li>
  <li>cleaning metals after casting, eg to remove oxides and greases</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="check-if-you-need-a-permit">Check if you need a permit</h3>

<p>If you use organic solvents, you may require an environmental permit from the Environment Agency or your local authority. If you have a permit you must comply with its conditions, which may require you to reduce or control your solvent emissions.</p>

<p>See the guide on environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-water-pollution-from-solvents">Prevent water pollution from solvents</h3>

<p>You must not allow solvents to enter surface water drains, surface waters, the ground or groundwater. This causes pollution and you could be prosecuted.</p>

<p>If you intend to discharge solvents to the foul sewer, you must have an authorisation from your local water and sewerage company.</p>

<p>See the guide on environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production.</p>

<h3 id="ods-and-f-gases-in-solvents">
<abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr> and F-gases in solvents</h3>

<p>You must not use solvents containing ozone-depleting substances (<abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Solvents which contain fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) that have a high potential to cause global warming are restricted. You must never allow F-gas solvents to vent directly to the air or be discharged directly into drains.</p>

<p>If you operate equipment that contains F-gas solvents you must ensure the solvents are recovered properly during servicing, maintenance and at the end of the equipment’s life. This must be done by someone with the correct qualifications. </p>

<h3 id="good-practice-for-solvent-use">Good practice for solvent use</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep solvent containers closed when you are not using them - this will minimise emissions evaporating into the atmosphere</li>
  <li>cover your solvent storage area to prevent weather conditions affecting your containers or containment systems</li>
  <li>check the condition of your solvent containers regularly</li>
  <li>locate, use and maintain solvent storage facilities as you would other chemical storage facilities</li>
  <li>ask your solvent supplier if they offer a solvent reclamation service - this can reduce the amount you spend on solvents</li>
  <li>review the solvents that you store and use on site regularly to determine if lower <abbr title="volatile organic compound">VOC</abbr> alternatives can be used instead</li>
  <li>consider using water-based lubricants instead of solvent-based ones in metal casting processes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="polychlorinated-biphenyl-responsibilities">Polychlorinated biphenyl responsibilities</h2>

<p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (<abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>) are man-made chemicals. They are dangerous to human health and the environment and you must dispose of them correctly and in most cases as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Using <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> to make electrical equipment and related products is now banned. If you have equipment made in Europe before 1987 it may contain <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>. Older equipment that could contains <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>electrical transformers</li>
  <li>power factor capacitors</li>
  <li>heat transfer equipment</li>
  <li>pole-mounted transformers</li>
  <li>process heating equipment</li>
  <li>high temperature hydraulic systems</li>
  <li>electrical resistors</li>
  <li>bushings and other high voltage equipment</li>
  <li>fluorescent light ballasts</li>
  <li>vacuum pumps</li>
</ul>
<p>In metals production and processing businesses, electric arc furnaces or industrial combustion processes may emit <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-equipment-containing-pcbs-safely">Dealing with equipment containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> safely</h3>

<p>You must arrange for the safe disposal or decontamination of all equipment that contains more than 50 parts per million (ppm) of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> as soon as possible, unless you are permitted to continue using it.</p>

<p>If your equipment contains more than five litres of any substance with a <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr> concentration greater than 50ppm it is classed as Contaminated Equipment.</p>

<p>You must not possess Contaminated Equipment unless your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses transformers with <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr> oil at concentrations of no more than 500ppm. You can continue to use the transformer until the end of its useful life. You should register the equipment with the Environment Agency and renew the registration annually if it contains oil with a <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr> concentration at or above 50ppm.</li>
  <li>Uses <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> only for analytical or research work. You must ensure that you dispose of the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> properly when this purpose comes to an end.</li>
  <li>Has the proper authorisation to decontaminate or dispose of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> and holds them only for this reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you possess any equipment with components that contain <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr>, and neither the component nor the larger equipment is classed as Contaminated Equipment, you may continue to possess the equipment until it is taken out of use, for example capacitors within fluorescent lighting strips. You must dispose of the equipment correctly at the end of its useful life.</p>

<h3 id="registering-contaminated-equipment">Registering Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>If you possess Contaminated Equipment you must register it with the Environment Agency, even if you are about to dispose of it. You must also register any equipment that could potentially be Contaminated Equipment unless it is reasonable to assume that it is not contaminated. You must renew your registrations annually for as long as you have the equipment.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/hazsubstances/32000.aspx">Read <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr> registration guidance on the Environment Agency website.</a></p>

<h3 id="decontaminating-contaminated-equipment">Decontaminating Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>You should arrange for the safe decontamination of all Contaminated Equipment you have as soon as possible, unless you are permitted to continue using it.</p>

<p>Decontamination reduces the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr> concentration of Contaminated Equipment to less than 50ppm. When you submit your registration or renewal paperwork you should tell the Environment Agency how and when you plan to have the decontamination work done.</p>

<h3 id="deregistering-contaminated-equipment">Deregistering Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>You should deregister your Contaminated Equipment after its disposal, decontamination or sale.</p>

<p>You will need to provide evidence such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>consignment note numbers for both the waste equipment and contaminated oil</li>
  <li>laboratory test reports</li>
  <li>contact details of the new owner</li>
</ul>
<p>Any new owner of your Contaminated Equipment must register it with the Environment Agency.</p>

<h3 id="labelling-all-contaminated-equipment">Labelling all Contaminated Equipment</h3>

<p>You must clearly label all Contaminated Equipment as containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> and place warning notices on the doors of any premises where the equipment is kept. Transformers that are held until the end of their useful life should also have an additional label showing they have been decontaminated to below 500ppm.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1043/schedules/made">Read about labelling decontaminated transformers in Schedule 2 of the Environmental Protection (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 on the Legislation.gov.uk website.</a></p>

<h3 id="diposing-of-waste-or-equipment-containing-pcbs-correctly">Diposing of waste or equipment containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> correctly</h3>

<p>You must dispose of all waste or equipment containing <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> safely. Wherever possible you should dispose of the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr>-containing component or substance separately from the rest of the equipment.</p>

<p>If your waste contains any concentration of <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> it may be hazardous waste.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087389603&amp;topicId=1080466581">managing your hazardous waste</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyls">PCBs</abbr> are classed as persistent organic pollutants (<abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>) and their production, use and disposal are controlled internationally.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> Regulation if your waste or piece of equipment has a <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr> concentration above 50 milligrams per kilogram you must dispose of it so the <abbr title="Polychlorinated biphenyl">PCB</abbr> content is destroyed or permanently changed, for example by high temperature incineration.</p>
