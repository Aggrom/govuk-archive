<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK - like many other countries - controls the movement (or ’export’) of certain specified items to other countries, including to other EU destinations. This applies even if the export is temporary - such as for an exhibition, a competition or for the purpose of a holiday.</p>

<p>The list of specified ’controlled’ items (known as ’strategic goods’) also includes firearms, ammunition and related equipment.</p>

<p>Depending on whether you are a business or an individual, you are likely to need to complete one or other of the following documents for customs purposes if you intend to take a firearm overseas:</p>

<ul>
<li>an export licence issued by the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>EC3, EC4 and EC5 forms - valid documentation required in conjunction with particular export licence applications</li>
  <li>Prior Import Consent (<abbr title="Prior Import Consent">PIC</abbr>) - obtained from the relevant authority in the destination country of import</li>
  <li>a European Firearms Pass (<abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>) - issued by the Firearms Licensing Unit of your local police authority</li>
  <li>a Firearms Certificate - issued by your local police authority and proving ownership of the item</li>
</ul>
<p>In many situations, the legislation will permit an export without the need for an export licence, provided certain requirements are met.</p>

<p>In other cases, you will need to apply for an export licence from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. A breach of export controls is a criminal offence punishable with fines and/or imprisonment.</p>

<p>This guidance focuses on licensing requirements administered by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> if you intend to export firearms either within or outside the EU. It includes details of how you can apply for an <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> issued Standard Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>) if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="what-firearms-are-subject-to-export-controls">What firearms are subject to export controls?</h2>

<p>Firearms are described by control entries ML1 and ML2 of Schedule 2 of the Export Control Order 2008, as amended. You can read entries <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3231/schedule/2/part/PART1/made">ML1 and ML2 on the Legislation.gov website.</a></p>

<p>Schedule 2 is entitled ‘Military, security and para-military goods, software and technology and arms, ammunition and related material’, but is commonly known as the ‘UK Military List’ (which forms part of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists). For more information, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items">UK Strategic Export Control Lists - the consolidated list of strategic military and dual-use items</a>.</p>

<p>Even though ML1 and ML2 appear on the UK Military List, firearms and related goods are controlled even when they are designed for use in sport rather than for military use. For example, most shotguns and rifles will be specified by ML1.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-to-apply-for-an-export-licence-or-not">Do I need to apply for an export licence or not?</h3>

<p>If you wish to export items in listed under the ML1 and ML2 control entries - even temporarily - from the UK, you will have to consider whether the ‘personal effects’ exemption applies (and in the case of exports to the EU if you can also use an <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>).  </p>

<p>If the exemption does not apply you will need to apply for an export licence issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Depending on what type of exporter you are (business or individual) and depending on the exact nature of your export you might be able to apply (or register) for different types of licences such as an Open General Export Licence (<abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr>), <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> or Open Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>). </p>

<h3 id="age-related-and-cultural-goodslicensing-considerations">Age-related and cultural goods licensing considerations</h3>

<p>You should also note that the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s licensing criteria does not include an upper age limitation. Firearms are still controlled even if they fall into the category of historic firearms. However, in cases where an export licence is required for these items, you may be able to use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-goods-ogels#ogel-historic-military-goods"><abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> (Historic Military Goods)</a>, if you can adhere to all the specified terms and conditions.</p>

<p>Any items over 50 years old also require separate licence coverage from the Arts Council who are responsible for licensing cultural goods. </p>

<h2 id="the-export-of-firearms-by-registered-firearms-dealers-rfds-and-other-businesses">The export of firearms by registered firearms dealers (RFDs) and other businesses</h2>

<p>Any businesses, including registered firearms dealers (RFDs), that are exporting firearms within or beyond the EU - whether temporarily or permanently - will need to apply or register for an appropriate export licence issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="apply-for-either-an-ogel-or-a-siel">Apply for either an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> or a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> </h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> issues various different licence types which permit the export of specified goods to specified destinations. Depending on the exact nature of your export, you might be able to consider using an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr>. <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> are designed to licence controlled goods that are being exported to less sensitive destinations. </p>

<p>If you are unable to meet all the requirements of <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> usage, you will need to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="apply-for-a-dealer-to-dealer-oiel">Apply for a Dealer-to-Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> also provides some more flexible licensing arrangements for registered firearms dealers, which avoids the need to apply for a new licence for every export. This option is known as a Dealer-to-Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, which is valid for three years. It authorises UK registered firearms dealers only to export certain categories of firearms and ammunition solely to other gun dealers in the EU.</p>

<p>If you wish to export firearms and ammunition to any other consignee in the EU, you must apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>.</p>

<p>Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> are only issued if the dealer can demonstrate a business need to use these arrangements and can satisfy the documentation needs.</p>

<p>For non-EU destinations, an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr> may be applied for - to allow multiple exports over a period of usually three years - to cover sales to other registered firearms dealers, provided a business need can be demonstrated.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login">apply for <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>, including Dealer-to-Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> using SPIRE on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Further details about <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> can be found in <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/open-individual-export-licences">Open Individual Export Licences (<abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="supporting-documentation-required-for-dealer-oiels">Supporting documentation required for Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>All applications for <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr>, including those for temporary exports need supporting documentation. The documentation required can vary between applications and you should look at the separate guidance notes available in <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/do-your-goods-need-an-export-licence">Strategic goods: when to apply for an export licence</a>. You might also find it helpful to see the guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/submitting-export-licence-applications-correctly">common pitfalls to avoid in export licence applications</a>.</p>

<p>Documentation requirements include specifying intended use and attaching a completed End-User Undertaking (<abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr>).</p>

<p>For instance, you should note that if you wish to exhibit, demonstrate or export - permanently or temporarily - any item included in Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended), you must hold an authority issued under Section 5 of this Act.</p>

</h3>

<p>Before making each shipment under the authority of a Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, copies of valid documentation must be forwarded to the Home Office at least two working days beforehand.</p>

<p>This includes copies of the EC5 form (a transfer declaration for Dealer to Dealer <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr> available from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>) and <abbr title="Prior Import Consents">PICs</abbr> (obtained from the relevant issuing authority in the country of import).</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/forms/ec5.doc">download form EC5 from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>) website (DOC, 122K).</a></p>

<p>Where consignments are being exported under an <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licence">OIEL</abbr>, a document referring to that licence and giving details of the firearms being transferred must accompany each consignment.</p>

<h2 id="the-export-of-firearms-by-individuals">The export of firearms by individuals</h2>

<p>If you are an individual planning to take a firearm overseas, this is also considered an export. Depending on the nature of your export (for instance whether you are travelling to another EU country or on temporary or permanent basis) then you might be able to use the ‘personal effects’ waiver in conjunction with an <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr> issued by your local police authority. If this is not an option you need to apply for an export licence issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="temporary-exports-to-the-eu">Temporary exports to the EU</h3>

<p>For temporary exports to other EU member states - for instance on hunting and sporting trips - the ‘personal effects’ waiver can normally be used, backed up by the possession of a <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="permanent-exports-to-the-eu">Permanent exports to the EU</h3>

<p>The decision on whether to issue a <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr> for a permanent export to an EU member state - for instance, where a UK resident is moving to live in another state and wishes to take their firearms with them - is one that is made by the local police force in the UK. If the local police force agrees to issue one, then the ‘personal effects’ waiver can be used and no export licence is needed to export the firearm from the UK.</p>

<h4 id="what-if-my-local-police-force-is-not-able-to-issue-an-efp">What if my local police force is not able to issue an <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>?</h4>

<p>Where the local police force in the UK is not able to issue a <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>, you will need to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="other-key-considerations-when-permanently-exporting-a-firearm-to-the-eu">Other key considerations when permanently exporting a firearm to the EU</h3>

<p>It is also important to remember that obtaining a <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr> or export licence issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> does not absolve you of all of your export responsibilities.</p>

<p>You need, for instance, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>notify your Firearms Licensing Office and provide proof of export</li>
  <li>inform your ferry operator or airline. The company you are travelling with may have additional rules about carrying firearms, sporting guns or ammunition.</li>
  <li>declare carrying firearms to Customs</li>
  <li>ensure that the import of the firearm is acceptable to the authorities of the destination country (by obtaining an Import Permit or <abbr title="Prior Import Consent">PIC</abbr> from the relevant issuing authority). This must be done before the personal effects export takes place.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be aware that the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> cannot be held responsible for any actions that authorities in the destination country might take if they believe relevant import regulations have not been satisfied.</p>

<p>This is particularly relevant for exports to France. French firearms import regulations oblige a person importing a firearm on a permanent basis to establish their credentials first with the police force in the locality of France where they intend to live.This process can take several months. Therefore, the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> advises all exporters to go through the relevant procedures before they attempt to export any firearms, either as ‘personal effects’ or under cover of an export licence.</p>

<h3 id="temporary-or-permanent-exports-beyond-the-eu">Temporary or permanent exports beyond the EU</h3>

<p>For the temporary or permanent export of firearms beyond the EU, the personal effects waiver can normally be used. However, if your final destination - even if you are flying indirectly - is a country to which the ‘personal effects’ waiver does not apply, you will need to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> from the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. </p>

<h2 id="efp-and-personal-effects-exemption-for-firearms-exports">
<abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr> and ‘personal effects’ exemption for firearms exports</h2>

<h3 id="details-of-personal-effects-waiver">Details of ‘Personal Effects’ Waiver</h3>

<p>The Export Control Order 2008 (as amended), which is the main legislation covering exports of controlled items, specifies a ‘personal effects’ exemption for firearms. For details, see <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3231/article/16/made">Article 16 of the Export Control Order 2008 on the Legislation.gov website.</a></p>

<p>As a result, export licences are not usually required where the holder of a valid firearm or shotgun certificate, or visitors’ firearm or shotgun permit takes firearms, shotguns, related ammunition and sights using non-electronic image enhancement for use therewith, abroad with them, or has them sent for their personal use as part of their personal effects, provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>these items are entered on the certificate</li>
  <li>the certificates are presented by the holder, or their appointed agent, with the items to an HM Revenue &amp; Customs officer at the place of export</li>
</ul>
<p>The waiver can normally be used for temporary or permanent export outside of the EU. However you should note that the exemption does not apply (even if flying indirectly) to exports to Iran or to a country or destination specified in Parts 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 4 of the Export Control Order 2008. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3231/contents/made#sch4">read Schedule 4 of the Order on the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website.</a> If this is the case you need to apply for an export licence issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. </p>

<p>The waiver can also normally be used for temporary or permanent export by individuals within the EU. If this is the case, then it can only be used where the exporter/owner possesses an <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>. For details see <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3231/contents/made#pt2-l1g15">Article 15 of the Export Control Order 2008 on the Legislation.gov website.</a></p>

<h3 id="obtaining-a-european-firearms-pass">Obtaining a European Firearms Pass</h3>

<p>A European Firearms Pass (<abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>) acts as proof to possess firearms and ammunition in your EU country of residence. It is a type of passport which is used when visiting another EU country. It does not automatically allow the possession of a firearm in the country you plan to visit, since there might be a ban on particular types of firearms in some countries.</p>

<p>To obtain an <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr> you need to contact the Firearms Licensing Unit within your local police authority, well ahead of your planned travel date. The pass is issued free of charge.</p>

<p>In making your request for a pass, you need to specify which weapons you wish to include. The <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr> will expire on the same date as the firearms or shotgun certificate it supports. In the case of an <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr> including both firearms and shotguns, it will end with whichever certificate expires first.</p>

<p>For more details, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.apa.police.uk/your-police-authority/contact-information">find a directory of local UK police authorities on the Association of Police Authorities (APA) website.</a></p>

<p>If the local police force is not able to issue an <abbr title="European Firearms Pass">EFP</abbr>, then you need to apply for an export licence issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. </p>

<h2 id="applying-for-a-siel-for-firearms-exports">Applying for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> for firearms exports</h2>

<p><abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences">SIELs</abbr> are issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/controlled-goods-export-licence-all-uk">apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> on SPIRE with <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>.</a></p>

<p>An application will need to comprise the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The completed SPIRE online application, accompanied by supporting documentation (which should include technical specifications describing the goods to be exported and an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> if required). For information on this, see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/end-user-and-consignee-undertakings-for-siels-and-oiels">End-User and Consignee Undertakings for <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licences">SIELs</abbr> and <abbr title="Open Individual Export Licences">OIELs</abbr></a>.</li>
  <li>A copy of your Firearms Certificate or Section 5 authority - these demonstrate to the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> that you legally hold the firearms that you intend to export.</li>
  <li>A copy of the <abbr title="Prior Import Consent">PIC</abbr> - to demonstrate that the destination country agrees to the firearm/s being imported there before submitting an export licence application. However, many countries do not class some weapons to be firearms and hence an import consent is not issued. In this instance an <abbr title="End-User Undertaking">EUU</abbr> will be required, together with a letter or email from the relevant licensing authorities stating that a <abbr title="Prior Import Consent">PIC</abbr> or equivalent cannot be issued.  Remember to research the import regulations of the destination country and get <abbr title="Prior Import Consents">PICs</abbr> or EUUs in place before you apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>.</li>
  <li>An EC3 form - for exports to EU countries. This summarises the details of the export and is passed between EU member states to flag up the movement of firearms.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/forms/ec3.doc">download an EC3 form from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (DOC, 116K).</a></p>

<p>Note that the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> cannot keep applications ‘on hold’ indefinitely and will withdraw applications if supporting documentation is not forthcoming in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> aims to provide a substantive response to <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> applications within 20 working days of receipt of the application, provided that it has all the information required to process the application.</p>

<h3 id="sanctions-and-other-restrictions">Sanctions and other restrictions</h3>

<p>All arms embargoes cover the export of firearms. For details of embargoes in force, see our section on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions">current arms embargoes and other restrictions</a>. Please note that these details are subject to change.</p>

<p>The ECOWAS (Economic Community of West Africa States) moratorium places restrictions on the import, export and manufacture of light weapons in designated West African States. For more information - including the exact countries covered by the Moratorium - see <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/arms-embargo-on-west-african-states">Arms embargo on West African States</a>.</p>

<h3 id="availability-of-open-general-licences-for-exporting-or-transhippingfirearms">Availability of Open General Licences for exporting or transhipping firearms</h3>

<p>Some exports may be made under an appropriate <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> or <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>. These are other types of licences issued by the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> and <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licences">OGTLs</abbr> are designed to control items that still require an export or transhipment licence but are generally of a less restricted nature or going to less sensitive export destinations. Before using these licences, you need to carefully read, understand and ensure that you can adhere to all the specified terms and conditions. You then need to register to use the licence. Using an <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr>, if you can meet all its requirements, means that you would not have to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr> - potentially saving you and your business time and money. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/open-general-licences-an-overview">Open General Export Licences (<abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>Open licences which may be available include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> (Accompanied Personal Effect: Sporting Guns) which allows - subject to certain conditions - the export of sporting firearms to Tanzania and Uganda. See the page on Accompanied Personal Effects: Sporting Firearms) in the guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/other-types-of-open-general-export-licence">other <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr></a>.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr> (Sporting Guns). This licence allows - subject to conditions - rifles, pistols and related ammuntion and telescopic sights to be imported and subsequently exported via the UK, provided the items are for sporting or recreational use. See the page on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/transit-and-transhipment">Transhipment Licences</a>.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> (Historic Military Goods) . This licence allows - subject to certain conditions - the export of historic military goods from the UK or any other European Union (EU) member state, where the exporter is established in the UK, providing the goods are worth less than £35,000 and were manufactured before 1897. For more details see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-goods-ogels#ogel-historic-military-goods">Historic Military Goods</a>.</li>

<h3 id="export-licensing-requirements-of-the-arts-council">Export licensing requirements of the Arts Council</h3>

<p>In addition to the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s licensing requirements, a separate licence issued by the Arts Council is required for firearms over a certain age and monetary limit. This Arts Council-issued licence is required (unless certain exceptions apply) if exporting from the UK to both EU and non-EU destinations for cultural reasons. Depending on the nature of your export, you might be able to use the Arts Council’s Cultural Goods <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> or an individual licence if you don’t meet the criteria. For more details see the page on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/other-types-of-open-general-export-licence"><abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> (Objects of Cultural Interest)</a></p>
