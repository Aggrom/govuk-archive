If your tenants have one of these:\r\n\r\ns1. You must usually give them '[notice to quit](/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/ending-a-tenancy \"Ending a tenancy\")'.\r\ns2. If your tenants don\u2019t leave by the date on the notice to quit, you must send them a \u2018notice of intention to seek possession\u2019 - this tells them you\u2019ll apply to the court for a possession order if they don\u2019t leave.\r\ns3. You must then apply to the court for a possession order, which gives you the right to evict your tenants and take possession of the property.\r\ns4. If the court gives you a possession order and your tenants still don\u2019t leave, you must apply for a warrant for eviction - this means bailiffs can remove your tenants from the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n###A fixed-term AST\r\n\r\nFixed-term tenancies run for a set amount of time. You must [give your tenants notice](/eviction-notices \"Eviction notices\") in a certain way if your tenants have a fixed-term tenancy.\r\n\r\nIf your tenants refuse to leave after being given notice, you must follow the same steps as for a periodic tenancy, from step 2.\r\n\r\n##Rules for excluded tenancies or licenses\r\n\r\nIf your tenants have an [excluded tenancy or licence](/# \"LINK NEEDS SORTING - SHOULD LINK TO LANDLORD VERSION OF TENANCY TYPES IN TENANCY AGREEMENTS GUIDE\") (eg they live with you), you don\u2019t have to go to court to evict them.\r\n\r\nYou only need to give them \u2018reasonable notice\u2019 to quit. Reasonable notice usually means the length of the rental payment period - so if your tenants pay rent weekly, you can give them 1 week\u2019s notice. The notice doesn\u2019t have to be in writing.\r\n\r\nYou can then change the locks on their rooms, even if they still have belongings there. However, you must give your tenants\u2019 belongings back to them.\r\n\r\nYour council can take action against you if you evict your tenants illegally.\r\n\r\n##Rules for assured and regulated tenancies\r\n\r\nIf your tenants started their tenancy before 27 February 1997, they might have an assured or a regulated tenancy. You will then have to follow different rules to evict them and they\u2019ll have increased protection from eviction.\r\n\r\nShelter has more information about [assured tenancies](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/private_tenancies/assured_tenancies/ \"Assured tenancies\"){:rel=\"external\"} and [regulated tenancies.](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/renting_and_leasehold/private_tenancies/regulated_tenancies/ \"Regulated tenancies\"){:rel=\"external\"}","slug":"rules-you-must-follow","title":"Rules you must follow"}},{"table":{"body":"In England and Wales, you can sometimes evict tenants using \u2018accelerated possession\u2019. This is quicker than a normal eviction and doesn\u2019t usually need a court hearing.\r\n\r\nYou can only do this if:\r\n\r\n+ your tenants have an assured shorthold tenancy or a statutory periodic tenancy\r\n+ they have a written tenancy agreement\r\n+ you\u2019ve given them the required written notice (a minimum of 2 months) in the right form\r\n+ you haven\u2019t asked them to leave before the end of a fixed-term tenancy\r\n\r\n^There is no accelerated possession process in Northern Ireland.^\r\n\r\n##How it works\r\n\r\nIf you apply to the court for accelerated possession, the court will send your tenants a copy of the application.\r\n\r\nIf your tenants want to challenge the application, they must do this within 14 days of receiving it.\r\n\r\nA judge will decide whether to:\r\n\r\n+ issue a possession order, giving you the right to evict your tenants and take possession of the property (this is normally the case)\r\n+ have a court hearing (this usually only happens if the paperwork isn\u2019t in order or your tenants raise an important issue)\r\n\r\nEven if there\u2019s a hearing, the court can still decide to issue a possession order.\r\n\r\n##If the judge issues a possession order\r\n\r\nIf the judge makes a possession order, your tenants will normally have 14 or 28 days to leave the property. If this will cause them exceptional hardship, the judge may give them up to 42 days to leave.\r\n\r\nIf they don\u2019t leave at this point, you can use bailiffs to evict them.","slug":"accelerated-possession","title":"Accelerated possession"}},{"table":{"body":"If the judge decides that a hearing is required, at the hearing they could:\r\n\r\n+ dismiss the court case - no order will be made and the hearing is finished\r\n+ adjourn the hearing - the hearing will be delayed until later, as the judge feels a decision can\u2019t be made on the day\r\n+ make an \u2018order\u2019 - the judge will make a legal decision on what will happen\r\n\r\nThe judge will dismiss the case if there\u2019s no reason your tenants should be evicted. This might happen if:\r\n\r\n+ you haven\u2019t followed the correct procedure\r\n+ you or your representative don\u2019t attend the hearing\r\n+ your tenant has paid any rent that was in arrears\r\n\r\nIf the judge dismisses the case, your tenants can stay in your property. If you want to evict them, you must restart the court process from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere are different kinds of orders a judge can make:\r\n\r\n##Order for possession (or \u2018outright possession order\u2019)\r\n\r\nThis means your tenants must leave the property before the date given in the order.\r\n\r\nThe date will be either 14 or 28 days after the court hearing. If your tenants are in an exceptionally difficult situation, the judge may agree to delay this for up to 6 weeks.\r\n\r\nIf your tenants don\u2019t leave your property by the date given, you can ask the court to evict them by asking for a \u2018warrant for possession\u2019. If the court gives a warrant, your tenants will be sent an eviction notice that gives a date when they must leave your property.\r\n\r\n##Suspended order for possession\r\n\r\nThis means if your tenants make the payments, or obey the conditions, set out in the order, they can stay in your property. If they don\u2019t make the payments, you can ask the court to evict them.\r\n\r\n##Money order\r\n\r\nThis means your tenants have to pay you the amount set out in the order. If they don\u2019t make the payments, action could be taken by the courts to recover the money, including:\r\n\r\n+ deducting money from your tenants\u2019 wages or bank account\r\n+ sending bailiffs to take away things they own\r\n\r\nIf your tenants get into rent arrears after a money order has been made, you can go to court again and ask for a possession order.\r\n\r\n##Possession orders with a money judgment\r\n\r\nA judge can add a money judgment to any of the possession orders. This means your tenants owe a specific amount of money, usually made up of:\r\n\r\n+ their rent arrears\r\n+ court fees\r\n+ your legal costs\r\n\r\nThe money judgment won\u2019t apply if your tenants pay their arrears and the amount set out in a suspended possession order.\r\n\r\nHowever, the money judgment will apply if they don\u2019t pay the amount set out in the suspended possession order that\u2019s linked to the judgment. If they don\u2019t pay, you can ask the court to carry out the instructions in the order and the judgment.","slug":"possession-hearings","title":"Possession hearings"}},{"table":{"body":"If your tenants don\u2019t leave your property by the date given in an outright possession order, you can ask the court for a \u2018warrant for possession\u2019.\r\n\r\nIf the court gives a warrant, your tenants will be sent an eviction notice that gives a date when they must leave your property.\r\n\r\nIf they don\u2019t go, bailiffs can evict them. The costs of doing this will be added to the money they owe.\r\n\r\n##Delaying eviction\r\n\r\nYour tenants can ask a judge to suspend the warrant for possession at a new hearing. This means the judge will delay the eviction or let your tenants stay in your property if they can make payments again.\r\n\r\nThe judge won\u2019t automatically agree to suspend the possession warrant.\r\n\r\n##Changing the payments\r\n\r\nIf your tenants\u2019 circumstances change, they can ask a judge at a new hearing to change what they pay. \r\n\r\n##Appealing against the decision\r\nYou can only appeal if you can show the judge made mistakes in the original possession hearing. You\u2019ll need to ask the judge for permission to appeal at the end of the original hearing.\r\n\r\nIf you get permission to appeal, you\u2019ll have to apply for an appeal hearing very soon afterwards.
