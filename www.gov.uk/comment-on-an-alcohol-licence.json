{"alternative_title":"","body":"$!Anyone can have a say about licensing decisions - you can comment on an existing licence or a new application by writing to the relevant licensing authority (local council).$!\r\n\r\nAll premises selling alcohol to the public need licenses (eg pubs, supermarkets, nightclubs). \r\n\r\n^You don't have to live or work near the premises to comment on a licence.^\r\n\r\n##Comment on a licence application\r\n\r\nAnyone applying for a licence has to advertise their application in a local newspaper and put a notice outside their premises for 28 days. \r\n\r\nThe licensing authority also has to publish details of the application on its website.\r\n\r\nIf you want to comment, you have 28 days after the licensing authority gets the application. Your comments must be serious (ie not trivial) and relate to either:\r\n\r\n- the prevention of crime and disorder\r\n- the prevention of public nuisance\r\n- the protection of children from harm\r\n- public safety\r\n\r\nIf you comment, you'll be invited to the licensing hearing, where the licensing authority may:\r\n\r\n- grant the licence\r\n- refuse the application\r\n- grant the licence but impose conditions (eg earlier closing times)\r\n- exclude certain activities from the licence (eg they may grant an alcohol licence but not allow live music)\r\n\r\n##Comment on an existing licence\r\n\r\nIf there are problems with a premises, you can ask for them to be reviewed if they relate to either:\r\n\r\n- the prevention of crime and disorder\r\n- the prevention of public nuisance\r\n- the protection of children from harm\r\n- public safety\r\n\r\n^Your request might be rejected if it's trivial, is about an issue that's been considered before or doesn't relate to one of the above.^\r\n\r\nTo ask for a review, write to:\r\n\r\n- the licensing authority (local council)\r\n- the licence holder\r\n- the 'responsible authorities' (details and addresses will be available from the licensing authority) \r\n\r\nIf your request for a review is accepted, the licensing authority will advertise this and ask for comments - people have 28 days to give them.\r\n\r\nYou'll also be invited to the review hearing, where you can speak if you want to. \r\n\r\n##Decisions the licensing authority can make\r\n\r\nAfter the hearing, the licensing authority might:\r\n\r\n- take no action\r\n- change, add or remove licence conditions\r\n- exclude certain activities from the licence\r\n- remove the 'premises supervisor' (the person named in the licence who controls the premises)\r\n- suspend the licence for up to 3 months\r\n- revoke the licence\r\n\r\nAnyone involved in a licence review can appeal the licensing authority's decision to the magistrates' court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","overview":"How to comment on an alcohol licence or ask for an existing licence to be reviewed - what you need to do, who to apply to and what happens at licensing hearings","slug":"comment-on-an-alcohol-licence","title":"Comment on an alcohol licence","updated_at":"2012-10-03T17:21:57+00:00","type":"answer"}
