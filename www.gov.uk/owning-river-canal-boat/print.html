  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You need to have the following in place before you can take your boat on canals or rivers in Britain:</p>

<ul>
<li>insurance</li>
  <li>proof that it’s safe</li>
  <li>a place to store it when it isn’t being used (called a mooring)</li>
  <li>the correct licence or registration</li>
</ul></article><article id="insurance"><header><h1>Part 2: Insurance</h1>
  </header><p>You must have ‘third party’ insurance for at least £1 million. This covers others if there’s a problem; it doesn’t cover your boat or crew. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you crashed into another boat, third party insurance would cover damage to that boat and its crew.</p>
</div>

<p>You may choose to take out a comprehensive policy to cover your own boat and crew as well.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.waterscape.com/search?q=insurance" title="Boat insurance">Waterscape website</a> has a list of insurance companies that provide boat insurance.</p>

</article><article id="boat-safety"><header><h1>Part 3: Boat safety</h1>
  </header><p>Your boat must meet the standards set out in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.boatsafetyscheme.com" title="Boat Safety Scheme">Boat Safety Scheme</a> before you can get a licence or registration.  </p>

<p>If your boat is new, it should already meet the standards. From then on, it will need to be tested every 4 years.</p>

</article><article id="storing-your-boat"><header><h1>Part 4: Storing your boat</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need a place to keep your boat when you aren’t using it. This is called a ‘mooring’.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of marinas and mooring sites across Britain, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>moorings provided by private companies</li>
  <li>bankside moorings offered by navigation authorities </li>
  <li>boat club mooring - find a club near you on the <a rel="external" href="http://awcc.org.uk/regional-pages" title="Association of Waterways Cruising Clubs club finder">Association of Waterways Cruising Clubs website</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You won’t usually be given a licence or registration until you have a permanent mooring - unless you’re planning to live in the boat and move around.</p>

<p>When you’re on the move and looking for overnight stopping places, you can moor up on canal towpaths for free. There’s a fee even for temporary mooring on some rivers - check with the <a href="licences-and-registrations" title="Licences and registrations">organisation that manages the waterway</a> if you’re unsure.</p>

</article><article id="licences-and-registrations"><header><h1>Part 5: Licences and registrations</h1>
  </header><p>Once you have insurance and a boat safety certificate, you need to buy the right licence or registration for the waterway you want to use. </p>

<p>Almost all of Britain’s waterways are run by 3 main organisations:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/license-it/choosing-and-buying-a-licence" title="British Waterways: Choosing a license">British Waterways</a> runs almost all the canals, and rivers such as the Severn, Trent and Yorkshire Ouse</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/129910.aspx" title="Environment Agency: Register your boat">Environment Agency</a> runs the River Thames, the River Medway, and the rivers of East Anglia</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="http://www.broads-authority.gov.uk/boating/tolls-and-registration.html" title="Broads Authority: Tolls and registration">Broads Authority</a> runs the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads</li>
