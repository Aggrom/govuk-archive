  </header><p>Your approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>) registration can be suspended if the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrar thinks you pose a significant threat to public safety.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrar can suspend you if they’re considering:</p>

<ul>
<li>taking you off the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> register</li>
  <li>removing your trainee driving instructor licence</li>
  <li>refusing to extend your registration or trainee licence</li>

<h2>Claiming compensation</h2>

<p>You can <a href="compensation-if-you-stay-on-the-register" title="Claim compensation">claim compensation</a> if you’ve been suspended but are not then taken off the register.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are different <a href="http://www.dvtani.gov.uk/adi/adiregistration.asp" title="Rules about your ADI registration" rel="external">rules for your <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registration</a> in Northern Ireland.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="when-you-can-be-suspended"><header><h1>Part 2: When you can be suspended</h1>
  </header><p>Your approved driving instructor (<abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>) registration can be suspended if the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrar thinks you pose a significant threat to public safety.</p>

<p>For example, if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have been convicted of a sexual or violent offence</li>
  <li>are giving dangerous instruction that’s a major risk to the safety of your pupils and other road users</li>
</ul>
<h2>Telling you if you’re suspended</h2>

<p>You’ll get a letter from the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrar to tell you that your registration is suspended.</p>

<p>This will usually be at that same time that the registrar writes to tell you that they’re considering taking you off the register. </p>

<h2>Challenging your suspension</h2>

<p>You can use a judicial review to challenge the way in which the <abbr title="Approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> registrar made the decision to suspend you. </p>

<p>The review only looks at whether the right procedures have been followed, rather than the decision itself.</p>

<h2>When to claim</h2>

<p>You must send your claim within 2 years of whichever of these dates is later:</p>

</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can claim outside of the 2 years in special situations.</p>

<h2>Evidence to support your claim</h2>

<p>You should send documents that prove the basis of your claim, eg showing why you’ve based your claim for income losses on a certain hourly rate.</p>

</article><article id="working-out-your-losses"><header><h1>Part 5: Working out your losses</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need to work out your income and non-income losses to send your claim.</p>

<h2>Work out your income losses</h2>

<p>You’ll need to work how much you’d have reasonably expected to earn during the time you were suspended.</p>

<p>This should be based on your income for a period that you can directly compare with, eg the same period the previous year. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should base your claim on the period that best compares to the time you were suspended if you can’t directly compare with a previous year.</p>

<h2>Work out your non-income losses</h2>

<p>Your claim will need to make clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>how the non-income losses were incurred</li>
  <li>why they are reasonable costs</li>
  <li>how you have worked them out</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll need to send documents that clearly support your claim.</p>
</div>

<p>You can claim for the interest paid on a loan that you took out because your income stopped from being suspended.</p>

<p>You can claim for the cost of preparing your compensation application. This can include the cost of getting expert help to work out how much your non-income losses are.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You’ll need to prove that the cost was reasonable, eg by showing that you didn’t pay a higher fee than usually applies.</p>
