  </header><p>Statutory Adoption Pay is a weekly payment you get from your employer to help take time off work when you adopt a child.</p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>If your average weekly earnings are <strong>more than</strong> £107 (before tax) Statutory Adoption Pay is £135.45.</p>

<p>If you earn <strong>less than</strong> £107 a week before tax you’ll get 90% of your average weekly earnings. </p>

<p>Statutory Adoption Pay is payable for 39 weeks.</p>

<p>Your employer will pay Statutory Adoption Pay to you in the same way and at the same time as your normal wages.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Statutory Adoption Pay is treated as normal pay, so your employer will deduct tax and National Insurance as usual.</p>
