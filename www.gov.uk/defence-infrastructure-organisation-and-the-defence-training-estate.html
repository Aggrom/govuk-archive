<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Over two-thirds of the 240,000 hectares of land owned by the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> is held solely for the purpose of training the Armed Forces. This land is known as the Defence Training Estate.</p>

<p>The Defence Training Estate (<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr>) comprises 16 major Armed Forces training areas, and 104 other minor training areas, ranges and camps.</p>

<p>There are six regional training areas covering the whole of the UK:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr> East (including Northern Ireland)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr> North (including Otterburn) </li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr> Scotland</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr> South East (including Home Counties)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr> South West (including Salisbury Plain)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Defence Training Estate">DTE</abbr> Wales &amp; West</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also training areas of varying size and complexity used by the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> overseas, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Belize - 5 training areas</li>
  <li>Brunei - 2 Jungle training areas</li>
  <li>Kenya - 13 training areas</li>
  <li>Canada - 1 training area (three times the size of Salisbury Plain Training Area)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="military-use">Military use</h3>

<p>The Defence Training Estate is managed to ensure that it delivers military training facilities which prepare the Armed Forces for operations worldwide.</p>

<p>There is an average daily throughput of 9,000 Service personnel on the Defence Training Estate.</p>

<h3 id="private-and-commercial-use">Private and Commercial Use</h3>

<p>Not all parts of the Defence Training Estate are required for training purposes every day of the week.</p>

<p>As long as proposed activities do not interfere with any of the Armed Forces’ vital training activities, this spare capacity can be hired out for private or commercial use. The income generated helps to reduce the financial burden on the taxpayer.</p>

<p>The Defence Training Estate has been used for many purposes, from filming to falconry, motor sports to model aircraft flying and corporate training events to concerts.</p>

<h2 id="access-and-recreation-at-otterburn">Access and Recreation at Otterburn</h2>

<p>There are no restrictions to public access on <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> land north of the River Coquet.  The remainder of the training area is operated under Military Byelaws, and access is restricted when the area is used for live firing.  However when it is not being used for live firing there are opportunities for cycling, riding, walking and climbing or just a drive in the car along the military roads.</p>

<p>There are two zones here:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Open Access Area (marked cream on the map) is open all round.</li>
  <li>the Controlled Access (marked mauve on the map) is used for live firing. When it is being used for training red flags are flown/red lamps are lit to show that it is closed to visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>When no red flags are flying, visitors must keep to the roads or way-marked paths.</p>

<p>Information Packs relating to public access are available from National Park Visitor Information Points or can be requested from Otterburn Training Area.</p>

<p>When planning a visit to the Otterburn Ranges please check the calendar of firing times published by the Northumberland National Park Authority.</p>

<h3 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h3>

<p>If you have any enquiries or need further information relating to public access and live firing times contact Otterburn Range Control on 01830 520569 or email us.</p>

<h2 id="archaeology-at-otterburn">Archaeology at Otterburn</h2>

<p>Otterburn Ranges has one of the greatest concentrations of archaeological and historic remains in the north of England.</p>

<p>The archaeological and historic remains date from the Prehistoric, Roman, Medieval and later periods and include burial cairns, Roman roads and marching camps, bastles, farmsteads, lime-kilns and military remains.</p>

<p>The Roman Road of Dere Street, with the marching camps that lie alongside it, crosses the Ranges. The camps at Chew Green and Birdhope are the easiest Roman remains to visit.</p>

<p>You can walk along Dere Street and into Scotland from the camps at Chew Green. A Roman signal station stood at Brownhart Law and if the weather is clear you can see the three hills above Melrose which gave the Roman legionary fort of Trimontium there its name.</p>

<p>The Bronze Age cairns on the summit of Thirl Moor are a visible landmark though cannot be visited as they are in the Danger Area, but the 17th century bastles to the east of the Ranges can be viewed when there is no firing.</p>

<p>It is important for reasons of safety, as well as to respect the historic environment, that metal detectors are not used on the Ranges.</p>

<p>Further information on the archaeology of the area can be found on the Northumberland National Park’s website.</p>

<h2 id="conservation-and-environment-at-otterburn">Conservation and Environment at Otterburn</h2>

<p>Otterburn Ranges are set in some of the most unspoilt areas in the Northumberland National Park and lie between the valley of the River Rede and the Border Ridge. The landscape falls into the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Cheviots</li>
  <li>Coquet Valley</li>
  <li>Cottonshope Valley</li>
  <li>Moorland Plateau</li>
  <li>Redesdale </li>
  <li>Grasslees Valley</li>
  <li>Sandstone Hills</li>
</ul>
<p>Otterburn Training Area also hosts many rare and protected habitats.</p>

<p>The Ranges contain most of the few species-rich upland hay meadows left in the National Park. These are an internationally rare habitat as 95% of these meadows have been lost across Europe over the last 50 years.</p>

<p>There are 260 hectares of blanket bogs which is an internationally rare habitat. They provide a habitat for the large heath butterfly which is mainly found within the UK in Scotland.</p>

<p>The most northerly upland heath in England is found here. It is important for ground nesting birds such as the black grouse, skylark and curlew.</p>

<p>There are also some of the cleanest and clearest rivers and burns in the country which are home to salmon and trout, as well as the otter and heron that feed on them.</p>

<p>Further information on habitat and wildlife conservation within this area can be found on the Northumberland National Park’s website.</p>

<h2 id="dartmoor-training-area">Dartmoor Training Area</h2>

<p>Dartmoor Training Area is situated in West Devon, south of Okehampton, and covers about 12,760 ha (31,500 acres) of freehold, leased or licensed land within the Dartmoor National Park.</p>

<p>The military has a long history of training on Dartmoor. Troops trained and manoeuvred across Dartmoor throughout the 1800s. Artillery training started in 1873 and Okehampton Camp was built in 1893. Dartmoor made a considerable contribution to training the Allies for D Day, with all of the open land being used for military training.</p>

<p>After the Second World War, the area used by the military was reduced from about 55,000 hectares to about 13,000 hectares estate, similar to that used now.</p>

<p>Today, Dartmoor is used for the training of light forces; those that deploy in low ground pressure vehicle, by helicopter, by parachute or on their feet, and for personnel from medium and heavy forces practicing operations away from their vehicles.</p>

<h2 id="farming-and-forestry-at-otterburn">Farming and Forestry at Otterburn</h2>

<h3 id="farming">Farming</h3>

<p>This part of Northumberland is one of the most important sheep farming areas in the country. There are 31 farms on the Ranges all of which raise sheep.</p>

<p>The cold climate and moorland soils and vegetation limit agriculture to grazing for hardy breeds though some forage is grown on improved land. Many of the farms also raise cattle for beef.</p>

<p>Sheep flocks are ‘hefted’ to their ground – meaning they don’t wander from their own area so the land is unfenced. Please keep your dog on a leash when near any livestock.</p>

<p>The flocks are mainly Scottish Blackface or Cheviot sheep. The Blackface has a black or a black and white face. The Cheviot has a white wool free face and long muzzle.</p>

<p>The average size of a farm is 680 hectares. These can support large flocks of hundreds of sheep. </p>

<p>All live firing stops between mid April to mid May for the ‘lambing break’ and the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> keeps the farmers informed of training activities so that the shepherds can move the flocks to safety.</p>

<p>Further information on farming within this area can be found on the Northumberland National Park’s website.</p>

<h3 id="forestry">Forestry</h3>

<p>The woodlands on the Ranges are managed for timber, but they also provide shelter for troops, and a tactical environment for them to train in and around. For military training purposes they need to be wind-firm, fire resistant and have continuous all year tree cover.</p>

<p>Woodlands also add to the landscape and nature conservation value of the area.</p>

<p>Ancient semi-natural woodlands are those that have had continuous tree cover since 1600. These make up 185 hectares within the Ranges.</p>

<p>Three ancient semi-natural woodlands are <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSIs</abbr> (Sites of Special Scientific Interest) – Ramsey’s Burn Wood, Grasslees Wood and Holystone Burn Woods.</p>

<p>Other ancient semi-natural woods can be seen at Barrow Scar and Barrow Burn Woods, Usway Burn and Durtrees Burn Wood.</p>

<p>Since 1970 120 new mixed woodlands – over 170 acres – have been planted to provide military cover and farm shelter. The coniferous woods across the Ranges are also important for military cover so a 20 year felling and restocking programme is being carried out.</p>

<h2 id="otterburn-training-area">Otterburn Training Area</h2>

<p>Otterburn Training Area is the second largest live firing range in the country and has been used for military training since 1911.</p>

<p>Otterburn Training Area consists of over 60,000 acres of land and has the largest impact area in the UK. Approximately 29,000 acres (11,750 hectares) is set aside for ‘dry’ (i.e. non-live firing) training.  Some 30,000 soldiers use the area each year and may spend several weeks training here. Hutted camps can accommodate a maximum of 1,600 visiting troops, at any one time.</p>

<p>The wide variety of terrain provides a realistic environment for British and NATO soldiers to train with the latest infantry weapons, artillery and helicopters. </p>

<p>There are two main live firing range areas at Otterburn for artillery, demolitions, all infantry weapons and restricted armoured vehicle firing. Fighter aircraft and helicopters also practice ground attack firing, and there are parachute dropping zones. A wide selection of live firing ranges provide facilities for weapons from 5.56mm calibre small arms to 155mm artillery and 30mm guns on armoured reconnaissance vehicles. The soft nature of the ground precludes the use of heavy armoured vehicles such as Main Battle Tanks.</p>

<p>It also preserves one of England’s remotest upland areas and is rich in history, folklore, landscape and wildlife.</p>

<p>Otterburn Training Area has many varied points of interest relating to its historic social land use such as Whiskey Stills and Bastle Houses.  The Roman Fortlet at Chew Green, and associated marching camps along Dere Street, provide visitors with great opportunities to experience the social struggles that were once so common in this part of Northumberland.  First World War training trenches can also still be seen.</p>

<h2 id="access-and-recreation-on-dartmoor">Access and Recreation on Dartmoor</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> has a presumption in favour of public access wherever this is compatible with operational and military training use, public safety, security, conservation and the interests of tenants.</p>

<p>The right for the public to access Dartmoor on foot or on horseback was recognised by the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985 and more recently by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.</p>

<p>This access is only restricted, for the public’s safety, when live firing is programmed and notified.  At all other times the military share Dartmoor with other users.  To increase certainty of access, Guaranteed Public Access Periods have been agreed with the Dartmoor Steering Group.  The Firing Notice gives 6 weeks advance warning of the live firing programme; any cancellations are included promptly.</p>

<p>For your own safety please observe the safety information which is given on the Firing Notice page and is available in the Military and Dartmoor Information for Walkers and Riders booklet.</p>

<p>Military byelaws prohibit access to Range Danger Areas when live firing is programmed.  They also prohibit digging and interference with military items.  </p>

<p>Land over which <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> byelaws apply is excluded from the countryside and Rights of Way Act.  Consequently the Range Danger Areas are not depicted as public access land on Ordnance Survey maps.</p>

<p>The impact of military activities on the public enjoyment of Dartmoor has been studied and additional measures introduced to increase the quantity, quality and certainty of access.</p>

<h2 id="conservation-and-environment-on-dartmoor">Conservation and Environment on Dartmoor</h2>

<p>Designation of Dartmoor as a National Park recognises its natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> supports the National Park’s purpose of conserving and enhancing Dartmoor’s environment, and is committed to safeguarding and improving the valued landscape and heritage of its estate.</p>

<p>Dartmoor Training Area works closely with Dartmoor National Park Authority and Natural England to achieve Dartmoor’s Biodiversity Action Plan on its freehold land, and to assist landowners of licensed land.</p>

<p>It also works with English Heritage to safeguard Scheduled Monuments and other cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The Dartmoor Training Area Conservation Group, consisting of local enthusiasts, provides expert advice, knowledge and assistance with conservation.</p>

<h2 id="dartmoor-steering-group">Dartmoor Steering Group</h2>

<p>The Dartmoor Steering Group was established in 1978 on the instructions of the Secretaries of State for Defence and Environment following the recommendation of Baroness Sharp’s non statutory public inquiry into the Military use of Dartmoor in 1975.  It brings together the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> plus the key statutory and landowning bodies that have an interest in the management of Dartmoor Training Area to keep under review the best possible reconciliation of the requirements of military training, conservation and public access.</p>

<p>Its members include representatives of Commander 43 Wessex Brigade and Commandant Commando Training Centre Royal Marines, Defence Infrastructure Organisation, Dartmoor National Park Authority, Dartmoor Commoners Council, Duchy of Cornwall, English Heritage, Government Office of the South West and Natural England.</p>

<p>The Dartmoor Steering Group is supported by the Dartmoor Working Party.  Its purpose is to research issues as directed by the Chairmen, to resolve matters passed to them and to carry out day to day management of the Group’s responsibilities.  The alternating chairmen of the Dartmoor Working Party (and also joint secretaries of the Dartmoor Steering Group) are Commander Defence Training Estate South West and the Dartmoor National Park Authority’s Chief Executive.  Members include the Commandant Dartmoor Training Area, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation’s Senior Land Agent South West, the Duchy of Cornwall, the Dartmoor Commoners Council (2), Natural England (2) and English Heritage.</p>

<p>The Dartmoor Steering Group meets annually and since 2007 has published Minutes of its Meetings.  The Group reports periodically to the Secretaries of State for Defence and Environment.</p>

<h2 id="dartmoor-training-area-conservation-group">Dartmoor Training Area Conservation Group</h2>

<p>Volunteers of the Dartmoor Military Training Area Conservation Group provide advice and assistance to Dartmoor Training Area staff on reducing the effects of military activities.  The Group also advise on opportunities to protect and enhance the natural environment and cultural heritage as required by the landowner.</p>

<p>Formed in 1992 as the Willsworthy Conservation Group, it extended its role in 2004 to include all of the designated military training areas on Dartmoor.</p>

<p>There are some 15 members from a wide variety of backgrounds, experience and knowledge including archaeologists, ecologists and geologists.</p>

<p>The Group, which meets three times a year, has the following remit:</p>

<ul>
<li>advises on the management of <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s responsibilities</li>
  <li>maintains the Site Dossier</li>

<p>Anyone wishing to become a member of the Group is invited to contact Commandant Dartmoor Training Area.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-assessment">Environmental Assessment</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s principal licence to train on Dartmoor Training Area expires in 2012.</p>

<p>To ensure that the Armed Forces can maintain their high state of operational readiness, without interruption, there was an extensive process of study, review and public consultation prior to re-negotiation in order to provide clear evidence to the Ministers for Environment and Defence that:</p>

<ul>
<li>there is a clear military need for both live firing and dry training on Dartmoor Training Area</li>
  <li>management of the Dartmoor Training area for military activities will continue to be sensitive to environmental issues, farming and public access</li>
</ul>
<p>A report, produced by an independent consultant, on The Continuing Need for Military Training on Dartmoor concluded that “Dartmoor makes an essential contribution to the delivery of light force training and therefore remains a key (<abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr>) asset”.  Further work took place to inform potential future military options. </p>

<p>Having confirmed the need, a Scoping Report was widely consulted.  An Environmental Appraisal was conducted by an independent consultant to consider the potential environmental effects of activities associated with current and future military training on Dartmoor Training Area. </p>

<p>Many studies were conducted to ensure the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s effective management of its responsibilities for military activities on Dartmoor.  Those concerning environment, socio-economic and public access are listed below:</p>

<h2 id="firing-notice">Firing Notice</h2>

<h3 id="range-danger-areas">Range Danger Areas</h3>

<p>Within the designated military Training Areas on north Dartmoor there are three Range Danger Areas (Merrivale, Okehampton and Willsworthy), which are outlined on the 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 maps of the area.  They are used for live firing on a limited number of days each year. At all other times the public has access over the Range Danger Areas even though other forms of training may be taking place.</p>

<h3 id="warning-posts-and-signals">Warning Posts and Signals</h3>

<p>The perimeter of each Range Danger Areas is marked on the ground by outward facing warning notices on red and white posts. These warning posts and notices indicate the limit of safe approach to a Range Danger Area. When firing is in progress (on one, two or all three Ranges) warning signals - red flags by day and red lamps by night - are displayed at certain points appropriate to each range.</p>

<h3 id="access-limitations">Access Limitations</h3>

<p>For your own safety, entry into Range Danger Areas displaying warning signals is prohibited by byelaws and is of course dangerous. Please note that the Range Danger Areas boundaries abut each other; if firing occurs on two or three Range Danger Areas there is no safe passage between them. When no warning signals are displayed, it is quite safe to enter the Danger Area of that specific Range. Troops carrying out dry training with blank ammunition and pyrotechnics are warned to be considerate to other users.</p>

<h3 id="publication-of-firing-notices">Publication of Firing Notices</h3>

<p>Days and nights on which firing is to take place are advertised on this website, in the Tavistock and Okehampton Times on Thursdays, and in the Western Morning News and Express and Echo every Friday and on BBC Radio Devon every morning. Notices are also displayed in neighbouring police stations, some Post Offices, some public houses, and in National Park and Tourist Information Centres. Details of firing programmes can also be obtained by using the Freephone telephone answering service on 0800 4584868.</p>

<h3 id="last-minute-cancellations">Last Minute Cancellations</h3>

<p>On days when firing has been advertised, if the red flags are not flying by 0900 hours from April-September inclusive and by 1000 hours from October-March inclusive no firing will take place that day or the following night. This web site, BBC Radio Devon and the Dartmoor National Park Information Centres are informed of cancellations as soon as they occur.</p>

<h3 id="unexploded-ordnance">Unexploded Ordnance</h3>

<p>Do not touch any military debris - it may be dangerous. 
If you encounter any suspicious objects; mark the area, note the location and inform the Commandant 01837 657210 or police 08452 777444.</p>

<h2 id="land-management">Land Management</h2>

<p>Military use of Dartmoor is guided by the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s responsibilities to its landlords and its statutory responsibility to have regard for the National Park’s purposes of conservation and public access.</p>

<p>Management of training on Dartmoor is carefully controlled, supervised and managed by Dartmoor Training Area’s staff though Standing Orders, briefings and management plans.</p>

<p>Soldiers are taught to be considerate of others with whom they share Dartmoor.  They are also encouraged to understand and care for the National Park’s landscape, and its historic and natural environment. </p>

<p>Advice on the best way to achieve training objectives is given by the Commandant Dartmoor Training Area, his deputy, the Regimental Sergeant Major Instructor and the Training Area Marshals and Supervisors.  This includes briefings, which reinforce standing orders for the safe and sustainable conduct of training.  It also covers temporary restrictions to allow areas to recover after intensive use, to avoid sensitive breeding areas and to re-locate intensive training activities away from areas attracting large numbers of the public.</p>

<p>During the training package, Conducting Officers control activities, ensure that the safe system of training is in place and help participants to draw out the lessons learned from the training experience.</p>

<p>At the end of training or during breaks in the exercise, the troops go back over the ground to pick up empty cases and to make sure that no debris or litter has been left behind.</p>

<p>Training Area Marshals, Supervisors and wardens ensure that visiting units clean up, care for the environment and protect Dartmoor’s rugged beauty.</p>

<p>An environmental management system (ISO 14001) is used to assess the impacts of military activities.</p>

<p>The Integrated Rural Management Plan sets out how the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> cares for its responsibilities on the Dartmoor Training Area. Access to a copy is through the related pages.</p>

<h2 id="land-use">Land Use</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> has the use of some 13,000ha, about a quarter of the National Park’s open moorland.</p>

<p>Live firing is permitted on a limited number of days on approximately one fifth of Dartmoor’s unenclosed moorland.  In a similar way to the public, the military also walk on footpaths and bridleways, and over unenclosed moorland in small groups for fitness, navigation and adventurous training.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> owns freehold 1,354 hectares at Willsworthy.  The remainder of the designated training area is used under lease or licence.  Licenses permit specified activities and only transfer stated, and normally limited, rights and responsibilities.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Cornwall, which has extensive land holdings on Dartmoor, licenses to the military 9,808 hectares.  The present 21 year licence, which replaced a series of shorter duration licences, expires in 2012.  The longer licence has enabled the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> to be more constructive in assisting the Duchy to care for its Dartmoor estate.</p>

<p>Other major licences and leases held are with Lord Roborough’s Maristow Estate for 730 hectares on Merrivale and Ringmoor, and with South West Water for 866 hectares at Cramber.</p>

<p>Okehampton Camp is built on land held under a 999 year agreement with the Okehampton Park Estate, expiring in 2894.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> also enjoys licences for the use of Meldon Reservoir and Granulite Quarry, Dewerstone, Foggintor Quarry and Sheepstor.  Where there is a need for specific terrain or vegetation, the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> enters into shorter term agreements to Train on Private Land.</p>

<p>Close liaison is maintained with all landowners to ensure that the potential impacts of military training are minimised.</p>

<h2 id="dartmoors-military-history">Dartmoor’s military history</h2>

<p>Dartmoor’s special qualities have attracted military training for over 200 years.</p>

<p>During the Napoleonic wars regular and militia units exercised.  Large manoeuvres were held in 1853 and 1873.  Dartmoor was selected as the first artillery training ground in 1875, with horse drawn batteries travelling to the moor to fire during the summer months.  The successful training was consolidated with the building of Okehampton Camp in 1893.</p>

<p>Willsworthy was purchased in the early 1900s to provide the Plymouth Garrison with ranges and training area.</p>

<p>Artillery training continued though to the Second World War, when all of Dartmoor helped to prepare first British forces and then the 4th and 29th United States Divisions for the invasion.</p>

<h2 id="military-use-1">Military use</h2>

<p>The remote, rugged, challenging terrain and changeable climate of Dartmoor provide vital and demanding training for the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>Dartmoor is particularly suited for the training of light forces such as the Royal Marines.  Because of the boggy terrain, Dartmoor is not suitable for tanks or heavy tracked vehicles.</p>

<p>Dartmoor provides a valuable training area for the following regional military units:</p>

<ul>
<li>Royal Naval Base at Devonport</li>
  <li>HMS Raleigh (the Royal Navy’s main shore training establishment) at Torpoint</li>
  <li>Brittania Royal Naval College at Dartmouth</li>
  <li>Royal Naval Air Stations at Culdrose and Yeovilton</li>
  <li>The units of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines in Plymouth, Taunton and Barnstaple</li>
  <li>The Commando Training Centre at Lympstone</li>
  <li>43 Wessex Brigade and its units based in the South West</li>
  <li>Joint Survival School at St Mawgan</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same way that units based in the South West occasionally travel further afield to train elsewhere, so other units from across the UK also travel to Dartmoor to benefit from its unique features and facilities.</p>

The area is controlled by Byelaws and defined as a danger area. Live firing takes place most days on Sennybridge, and as the Epynt Way does not encroach on the Impact area the public can still use the Epynt Way ensuring they stay on the route.  This is clearly marked by way markers throughout with 1.2 metre posts and finger posts at junctions with external paths.</p>

<h3 id="live-firing-times-information">Live Firing Times Information</h3>

<p>The programme of firing times for Sennybridge can be found by clicking on the Firing Notice link to the right under Related pages.</p>

<h2 id="access-and-recreation-at-castlemartin">Access and Recreation at Castlemartin</h2>

<p>The Pembrokeshire Coast Path, a National Trail, crosses Range East (during non-firing periods) and inland along eight kilometres of roads past Range West.  When firing is in progress the road diversion through Bosherston provides a longer walk.</p>

<p>Vehicle access is available to Stack Rocks and St Govan’s Chapel.  Both of these are popular with sightseers, and the sea cliffs provide some of the best cliff climbing in the UK.</p>

<p>Range West and the inland part of Range East are generally not open to the public.  However, the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority/Defence Estates organises regular accompanied walks into this area.  Many other groups are also catered for through annual safety and conservation briefings.  These access opportunities are only available during non-firing periods.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> has created a new permissive 10km multi-user route along the inland boundary of the Ranges as an off-road alternative to the Range section of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Trail, which is unavailable when Castlemartin Range is being used for training.  Named the ‘Castlemartin Range Trail’ the route is mainly off-road and is way marked using green discs with a tank logo.  </p>

<p>The route runs from near Carew Farm, Bosherston in the east to near Gupton Farm, Freshwater West and offers panoramic views across the Range. It is imperative that users stay on the route as the Range is in constant use for military training.</p>

<p>It is the wish of the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> that the route will be open throughout the year; however sections may need to close temporarily for military training requirements or for land management reasons.</p>

<p>The route has been funded by the Welsh Assembly Government and the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr>, with a donation from the British Horse Society.  The <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> worked closely with the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, the Countryside Council for Wales and the National Trust in creating the Trail.</p>

<h2 id="capel-curig">Capel Curig</h2>

<p>Capel Curig Training Camp is located within the northern part of Snowdonia National Park.  The camp is approached from the A5 and is just three and a half miles from the village of Betws-y-Coed.</p>

<p>The camp covers an area of four hectares with a perimeter fence around the main buildings area of 845m.  The main camp area contains woodland and a helicopter landing area/sports field.  There is also provision of secure and centrally located accommodation for Units undertaking Adventurous Training in North Wales.  The Camp provides 280 bed spaces and catering facilities.</p>

<h2 id="castlemartin">Castlemartin</h2>

<p>Castlemartin covers about 5,900 acres (2,390 ha) of freehold land on the South Pembrokeshire coast within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.</p>

<p>The War Office requisitioned the area in 1938 from the Cawdor Estate, and many ruins of the former settlements that belonged to the 53 farming communities, which had to be relocated, can still be seen.  The land was returned to farming after the Second World War, but in 1951 the Korean War saw its reactivation for range use, which has remained in being ever since.  Farming has also continued alongside the range’s primary use with cattle, and in the winter, flocks of sheep.</p>

<p>A beautiful area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Castlemartin contains a wide variety of flora, as well as some of the finest limestone coastal scenery in the National Park.  It has significant archaeological and geological interest, including fossil records of international significance.  Castlemartin has been preserved as a spectacular coastal landscape, and Defence Estates manages its special heritage to preserve it for future generations.</p>

<h2 id="conservation-and-environment-at-castlemartin">Conservation and Environment at Castlemartin</h2>

<p>Castlemartin is home to a range of flora and fauna already lost in other parts of Great Britain. </p>

<p>There are many rare or uncommon species of birds, insects and plants; and Castlemartin has the highest concentration of seabirds on the Pembrokeshire mainland, including guillemots, razorbills and kittiwakes.  It also accommodates the chough – about a dozen pairs. </p>

<p>The grazing regime on the coastal heath and unimproved grassland encourages many birds such as wheatears, skylarks, meadow pipits, stonechats, and various species of warblers.  There is a breeding population of barn owls and other predators, such as ravens, buzzards, peregrines and kestrels, occur frequently.  Many rare insects are also found – the secluded shore even provides a habitat for a rare beetle, which shelters under driftwood.</p>

<p>Some of the pre-war farm buildings still survive, others are now in ruins.  Some are used for military training, and Flimston Chapel, maintained in good condition, may be visited, and regular services are held there.  The ancient St Govan’s Chapel, a tiny, much-visited building on the foreshore near St Govan’s Head on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, is leased to the National Park.</p>

<h2 id="epynt-way">Epynt Way</h2>

<p>The Epynt Way, which is some 80km in length, follows the periphery of SENTA.  The Epynt Way was established in 2003 and was completed in 2005.  It is a permissive bridleway which is open all the year round; however the <abbr title="Ministry Of Defence">MOD</abbr> reserves the right to close it if there is a requirement to do so.  In addition a number of circular routes connect to the Epynt Way.</p>

<p>The Epynt Way caters well for horses and has five horse corrals, along with horse box parking areas so people can ride sections or the whole of the Epynt Way.</p>

<p>The route encounters many terrains of varying challenges for horses and their riders, so it is recommended that a reconnaissance visit on foot is undertaken to avoid any nasty surprises!</p>

<p>By the Epynt Visitor Centre there is a path specifically designed for less able visitors.  It consists of approximately half a mile of surfaced walk way which leads to a viewing area.</p>

<h3 id="military-history">Military History</h3>

<p>The original Kinmel Park Camp was once many times larger than the existing camp, which is now awaiting disposal, and was the site of the alleged mutiny by Canadian troops which took place on the 4th March 1919.  During the disturbances five Canadian soldiers were shot dead and twenty eight wounded by their fellows before order could be restored.  Three of the five dead are buried in the nearby Bodelwyddan churchyard alongside another seventy eight Canadians, many of whom perished as a result of the 1918/19 influenza epidemics.</p>

<h3 id="conservation-and-environment">Conservation and Environment</h3>

<p>Kinmel Park Training Area plays host to a large winter migrant bird population, which takes full advantage of the large woods which surround the training area.  Flocks of redwing and fieldfare are abundant, particularly in harsh winters.  There are sizeable native bird populations of most species here.  Large predators include buzzard, carrion crow and raven.  There is also a large population of red deer which move freely through the training area, using the large woods on the sides of the area for cover.</p>

<h3 id="access-and-recreation-1">Access and Recreation</h3>

<h2 id="llansilin-range">Llansilin Range</h2>

<p>Llansilin Rifle Range is located approximately one mile NE of the village of Llansilin.  The range lies on the Oswestry to Llansilin Road (B4580) road mid way between the hamlet of Rhydrcroseau and Llansilin village at Grid reference 224/295.</p>

<p>Llansilin Rifle Range is a 400 yard 14 Lane Gallery Range; it has a hill background with a Range Danger Area that extends over the crest of the Coed Cochion hill which forms the back stop for the range.  The River Cynlaith flows between the 100m firing point and the range stopbutt, the river marks the border between England and Wales.</p>

<h3 id="conservation-and-environment-1">Conservation and Environment</h3>

<p>On top of the Coed Cochion Hill there is a lake known as the Llyn Rhuddwyn.  It is heavily used by migrant wildfowl and other birdlife because of its isolated and protected location.  There are a number of deciduous trees of great age and size including Ash and Beech which were historically coppiced.  There is also an Iron Age settlement and quarry located to the rear of the hill, and a number of interesting buildings which lie in the forest that forms the range danger area, including a 19th century shooting lodge with castellated ramparts.</p>

<p>The forest that lies within the Range Danger Area teems with both animal and bird life.  There is a small number of Red Deer and most of the other native mammal species can also be found here.  Bird life is prolific and includes raptors such as the Common Buzzard, and Red Kite can often be seen over the Coed Cochion.</p>

<h2 id="manorbier-range">Manorbier Range</h2>

<p>The Air Defence Range at Manorbier is the only range in mainland UK from where the High Velocity Missile, employed in the anti aircraft role, can be fired.  This weapon system is the latest in a design progression from the Blowpipe system, deployed during the Falkland campaign of 1982, through to the S15 Javelin, deployed during the first Gulf conflict 1990 – 91.  It is currently one of the most effective and technologically advanced air defence systems in the world.</p>

<p>The aim of each missile firing is to assess the effectiveness of the whole system and the ability of the missile operator to engage a hostile aircraft, simulated by an aerial target known as the Banshee.  Banshee, which looks like a very large model aircraft, is powered by a two cylinder petrol engine and carries sophisticated instrumentation.  Used in conjunction with ground monitoring equipment, these aircraft test the performance of the launcher and operator.  Banshee is launched out to sea and recovered by parachute at Manorbier Range.</p>

<p>In addition to High Velocity Missile firings, which constitute the core business of the range, Air Defence Range Manorbier also plays host to the Air Warfare Centre who conduct a variety of aircraft related trials.  Every effort is made to ensure that the inevitable low flying activity associated with these trials is kept to a minimum over the mainland.</p>

<p>During firing, surveillance radars and range safety craft ensure that no unauthorised ships or aircraft enter the range danger area.  This exclusion zone covers an area of 570 square kilometres to the south of the rangehead, out to 21 kilometres and up to a ceiling of 40,000 feet.</p>

<h2 id="military-use-at-castlemartin">Military Use at Castlemartin</h2>

<p>The range is open to all regular and Territorial Army, Cadet Forces and other services.  Castlemartin is the only UK Army range normally available for armoured units for direct-fire live gunnery exercises and associated manoeuvres, with both on-land impact areas and a large offshore safety area.  The facility is therefore mainly used for so-called ‘mounted’ and ‘dismounted’ (i.e. in-vehicle and on foot) field firing up to company level; but when such exercises are not under way it is also used for dismounted ‘dry’ training (i.e. without live firing) across most of the area.  It is also used by civilian organisations and research establishments. </p>

<h2 id="pembrey-sands">Pembrey Sands</h2>

<p>Pembrey Sands Air Weapons Range is primarily an air-to-ground bombing and strafing practice area.</p>

<p>The main users of the range are the instructors and students of 19(F) Sqn, flying the Hawk aircraft, although other fast jets can also use the facilities.  Military helicopters also use the range and its targets for cabin door gunnery practice.  In a typical year pilots will conduct 10,000 passes to target, drop 1,500 bombs and fire 120,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p>A 7,000ft Tactical Landing Zone (TLZ) can be established on the beach for C-130 Hercules crews to practise natural surface operations.  A Course for TLZ Safety Officers is regularly run at Pembrey Sands to train personnel in the techniques of laying out a suitable natural surface landing strip.</p>

<h3 id="range-firing-times">Range Firing Times</h3>

<p>Normal range firing times are 0900 - 1700, Monday – Thursday and 0900 - 1400 on Friday during the summer and 0900 - 1600 Monday – Thursday and 0900 - 1400 on Friday during the winter.</p>

<p>Night firing can take place on an irregular basis.  Other air and ground training activity does take place on the range outside these times including C130s landing on the beach, aircraft using the range targets but not firing weapons and various cadet organisations conducting exercises.</p>

<h2 id="sealand-rifle-range">Sealand Rifle Range</h2>

<p>The Sealand Rifle Ranges are small arms firing ranges comprising an operational range area and a Range Danger Area covering 486 hectares in the Dee Estuary near Chester.  There are three rifle ranges, two of which are currently in use.</p>

<h3 id="conservation-and-environment-2">Conservation and Environment</h3>

<p>The site lies across the border between England and Wales, thereby coming under the jurisdiction of both the Countryside Commission for Wales (<abbr title="Countryside Commission for Wales">CCW</abbr>) and Natural England (NE).  The <abbr title="Range Danger Area">RDA</abbr> comprises mainly of saltmarsh communities, with associated transitional swamp and scrub habitats.  The Dee Estuary, onto which the <abbr title="Range Danger Area">RDA</abbr> extends, is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Area of Conservation (habitats and species), a Special Protection Area for birds and a Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar site).  The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) looks after the grazing tenancy of the saltmarsh and enclosed range land. </p>

<p>The site is of international importance for water birds, during the winter the intertidal flats, saltmarshes and fringing habitats provide feeding and roosting sites for internationally important numbers of ducks and waders, in summer the site supports nationally important breeding colonies of two species of tern.  The site is very important during migration, particularly for wader populations moving along the west coast of Britain and for Sandwich terns post breeding. </p>

<h3 id="access-and-recreation-5">Access and Recreation</h3>

<p>There is no public access on to the Sealand Rifle Ranges or <abbr title="Range Danger Area">RDA</abbr> at any time.</p>
