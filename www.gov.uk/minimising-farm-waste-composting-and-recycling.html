<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Farm waste can have a significant environmental impact. Keeping farm waste to a minimum will reduce the risk of pollution, as well as the amount of waste going to landfill. Reducing the amount of waste you produce will reduce your costs.</p>

<p>In addition, farmers have environmental responsibilities under Cross Compliance regulations. These aim to protect water quality, local landscape and wildlife and are obligatory for any farmer who receives agricultural payments, though they are also good practice for all farmers and land managers.</p>

<p>This guide will define the different types of farm waste, and tell you what you can do to minimise the waste on your farm by reducing packaging, composting and recycling waste. It will also explain the regulations on disposing of farm waste. You may need to get an environmental permit or to register an exemption from environmental permitting with the Environment Agency for your waste activities.</p>

<h2 id="minimising-waste-by-reducing-energy-use">Minimising waste by reducing energy use</h2>

<p>All farmers produce waste in some form or another, and this can be divided into two types of waste - general farm waste and animal waste. Both of these types of waste can be hazardous.</p>

<p>You need to use the waste management hierarchy to determine how to prevent, reduce or most efficiently handle each type of waste your business produces. You must declare on your waste transfer notes and hazardous waste consignment notes that you have applied the waste management hierarchy. </p>

<h3 id="general-farm-waste">General farm waste</h3>

<p>Farm waste that falls into this category includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>feed waste</li>
  <li>used plastic silage wrapping</li>
  <li>unused sheep dip</li>
  <li>used veterinary products</li>
  <li>animal carcasses</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/non-hazardous-waste-treatment-and-disposal">non-hazardous waste: treatment and disposal</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/landspreading">landspreading</a>.</p>

<h3 id="animal-waste">Animal waste</h3>

<p>You can use animal manures and slurries not classed as animal waste as soil fertiliser. Using them in this way will reduce the amount of animal waste you need to deal with. For more information, see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-sewage-sludge-slurry-and-silage">sewage sludge, slurry and silage</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-nutrients-and-fertilisers">managing nutrients and fertilisers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hazardous-waste">Hazardous waste</h3>

<p>You should be especially careful how you handle, store and dispose of hazardous waste. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hazardous-waste-treatment-and-disposal">hazardous waste: treatment and disposal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-reduce-farm-waste">Why reduce farm waste?</h3>

<p>There are several reasons for reducing energy use on your farm, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>reducing carbon emissions, which helps counter the effects of global warming</li>
  <li>making energy supplies more secure</li>
  <li>saving money and improving competitiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>The Carbon Trust estimates that reducing energy consumption by 20% is a realistic achievement for most farming businesses. The savings that you can make from this reduction could be the same as a 5% increase in your sales.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/cut-carbon-reduce-costs/products-services/sector-advice/Pages/agriculture-horticulture-2.aspx">Find sector-specific energy use information on the Carbon Trust website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tax-breaks-on-energy-saving-equipment">Tax breaks on energy-saving equipment</h3>

<p>You may be able to claim an enhanced capital allowance (<abbr title="enhanced capital allowance">ECA</abbr>) if you buy plant or machinery for your farm which is energy efficient.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.eca.gov.uk/etl/">Read about tax breaks for energy-efficient equipment on the <abbr title="enhanced capital allowance">ECA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minimising-waste-by-preventing-pollution">Minimising waste by preventing pollution</h2>

<p>Good environmental management is good for business. Many pollution incidents are avoidable, such as those caused by pesticide leaks or slurry being stored or spread wrongly and running off into a watercourse or drains. You should note that the Environment Agency can take enforcement action for serious offences.</p>

<p>For more information on preventing pollution, read the guides on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/reducing-air-pollution-on-farms">air pollution on farms</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/water-pollution-on-farms">water pollution on farms</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="pollution-prevention-guidelines-ppgs">Pollution Prevention Guidelines (<abbr title="Pollution Prevention Guidelines">PPGs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency’s pollution prevention guidance can help your business avoid pollution incidents and show you how to deal with them if they do happen. <a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0501BFOX-e-e.pdf">Download a general PPG on how to avoid pollution from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 96K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="nitrate-vulnerable-zones-nvzs">Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (<abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zones">NVZs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If your land falls within an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>, there may be additional rules that affect your waste and recycling. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Nitrate Vulnerable Zones</a>.</p>

<h3 id="good-practice-guidance">Good practice guidance</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency has also produced a best practice guidance pack to help you reduce the risk of causing environmental pollution. The guide includes advice on:</p>

<ul>
<li>site drainage</li>
  <li>deliveries and handling</li>
  <li>waste management</li>
  <li>trade effluent</li>
  <li>groundwater</li>
  <li>training and emergencies</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/PMHO0104BHQI-E-E.pdf">download guidance on industrial and commercial pollution prevention from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 863K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cross-compliance">Cross Compliance</h3>

<p>Any action that you or your farming business takes to prevent pollution should always be seen within the context of Cross Compliance. Cross Compliance requirements apply to you if you receive payments under Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) support schemes or certain rural development schemes.</p>

<p>There are currently three components to Cross Compliance:</p>

<ul>
<li>specific European legal requirements, known as Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>domestic legal requirements requiring you to keep your land in good agricultural and environmental condition (<abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the protection of permanent pasture is a standard according to which member states must ensure a certain ratio of permanent pasture to total agricultural area. If the prescribed ratio cannot be maintained, member states must act - eg by requiring farmers to apply for authorisation to convert permanent pasture or by requiring farmers claiming the single payment to reconvert land back to permanent pasture</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be aware that your payments may be reduced or stopped if you do not comply with these requirements.</p>

<p>For more information on <abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr> and <abbr title="good agricultural and environmental condition">GAEC</abbr>, see the guides on:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">Cross Compliance: the basics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-management-requirements">SMR</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="anaerobic-digestion">Anaerobic digestion</h2>

<p>Anaerobic digestion (<abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr>) is the breakdown of organic matter by bacteria in the absence of oxygen. This natural process can create:</p>

<ul>
<li>biogas - renewable energy source for heat and power</li>
  <li>biomethane - biogas that has had the impurities, carbon dioxide and water removed so it can be used as a fuel for vehicles</li>
  <li>digestate - nutrient-rich organic fertiliser or soil conditioner</li>
</ul>
<p>You can house an <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr> system on-farm or use a larger, centrally located facility known as a Centralised Anaerobic Digestion facility.</p>

<h3 id="how-ad-works">How <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr> works</h3>

<p>Organic material is stored in an airless container, which acts as a digester. Bacteria take 20-40 days to break the material down and biogas is created, leaving a low-odour recyclable by-product called ‘digestate’.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of organic matter that can be used in <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr>, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>animal manure and slurries</li>
  <li>silage, maize and grass leys</li>
  <li>food waste and by-products</li>
  <li>crop residues</li>
  <li>biodegradable domestic waste</li>
  <li>sewage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-benefits-and-risks-of-ad">The benefits and risks of <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr>
</h3>

<p>In the UK, millions of tonnes of agricultural material and sewage sludge are produced every year. <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr> offers farmers the potential to use their waste to cut costs and generate income in a number of ways, for example through:</p>

<ul>
<li>renewable energy production - heating farm and outbuildings</li>
  <li>diversification - becoming a local waste recovery site</li>
  <li>reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
  <li>the sale of surplus energy</li>
  <li>the use and sale of digestate</li>
  <li>obtaining development support</li>
</ul>
<p>There are risks associated with <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr>, for example the:</p>

<ul>
<li>high setup costs</li>
  <li>regular organic material supply needs</li>
  <li>unintended gas leaks</li>
  <li>complex and expensive electric generator connection</li>
  <li>planning and local objection to infrastructure</li>
  <li>need for controlled digestate application</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="permission-and-permits">Permission and permits</h3>

<p>There are a number of steps that you will need to complete to start <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr>. For example you may need:</p>

<ul>
<li>planning permission.</li>
  <li>an environmental permit or an exemption for the operation of the <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr> plant. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/117111.aspx">Find information about exemption T24 for <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr> on the Environment Agency website</a>.</li>
  <li>a waste carrier registration if you are collecting or transporting someone else’s waste. <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/117257.aspx">Apply for a permit for an on-farm <abbr title="Anaerobic digestion">AD</abbr> facility on the Environment Agency website</a>.</li>

<h2 id="composting-biodegradable-waste">Composting biodegradable waste</h2>

<p>Most farm composts and digestates are made up of either green waste - eg hedge trimmings and tree prunings - or livestock manures and slurries. Composting farmyard manures can help concentrate nutrients, increasing efficiency.</p>

<p>Composting reduces the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfills and returns organic matter to the soil, reducing the need for inorganic fertilisers. Composting involves active management, such as turning the heaps and maintaining the best conditions for the waste to break down.</p>

<h3 id="registering-an-exemption-from-environmental-permitting-for-composting-waste">Registering an exemption from environmental permitting for composting waste</h3>

<p>You may need to register an exemption from environmental permitting with the Environment Agency if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>compost waste from your own farm, eg plant waste, horse and farmyard manure</li>
  <li>anaerobically digest farmyard manures and slurries</li>
  <li>compost off-farm waste, eg garden waste collected by your local authority</li>
</ul>
<p>New environmental permitting regulations came into force on 6 April 2010. If you registered an exemption before 6 April 2010 (paragraph 12 exemption for composting agricultural waste), you will have time to prepare for these changes.</p>

<p>You must re-register your exemption under the new system by:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 October 2011, if you are importing waste (agricultural or non-agricultural) for composting on agricultural land</li>
  <li>1 October 2013, if you are composting agricultural waste on agricultural land</li>
</ul>
<p>It is free to register all but one of the exemptions with the Environment Agency. You will however need to renew your exemption every three years.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/117109.aspx">Read guidance about exemptions for aerobic composting on your farm on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/117111.aspx">Read guidance about exemptions for anaerobic composting on your farm on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on composting on-site call the Environment Agency Agricultural Waste Helpline on: 0845 603 3113.</p>

<h3 id="check-the-conditions-of-your-composting-exemption">Check the conditions of your composting exemption</h3>

<p>You must meet the conditions of your exemption. The limits for composting have changed, so you need to check if you still comply. If you cannot meet the new conditions, you may be able to apply for a standard rules environmental permit.</p>

<p>The standard permits are made up of one or more sets of rules giving operators various options to choose from to meet defined outcomes or levels of environmental protection.</p>

<p>While standard permits save time and money, you can only use one if you meet all the criteria set out in that permit. If an inspection shows that you are operating under an inappropriate standard permit, your business will be deemed to be acting without a permit at all.</p>

<p>If there is no standard rule set available which matches your operation or if you are unable to comply with the standard rules, you will need to apply for a bespoke permit.</p>

<p>If you need an environmental permit, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay an application fee, and an annual subsistence fee</li>
  <li>demonstrate appropriate planning permission from your local authority</li>
  <li>prove your technical competence</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/117226.aspx">See the guidance on standard permits for composting biodegradable waste on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="follow-the-quality-protocol-for-compost">Follow the quality protocol for compost</h3>

<p>If your compost meets the requirements of the Environment Agency’s quality protocol for compost, it will no longer be classified as a waste, so it can be used without waste management controls.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/114395.aspx">Find out about the compost quality protocol on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="disposing-of-waste-and-fly-tipping">Disposing of waste and fly-tipping</h2>

<p>It is illegal to bury waste on your farm without an environmental permit from the Environment Agency. Getting such a permit is an impractical and expensive solution for most farmers.</p>

<p>Laws and a landfill tax have reduced the amount of waste being sent to landfill sites, reducing their impact on health and the environment.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-or-recycling-waste-legitimately">Disposing of, or recycling waste legitimately</h3>

<p>To dispose of waste legitimately, you can either:</p>

<ul>
<li>take or send it for disposal or recycling at an authorised site</li>
  <li>register an exemption from environmental permitting with the Environment Agency to recycle waste on-farm</li>
</ul>
<p>To register, you can call the Environment Agency Agricultural Waste Helpline on: 0845 603 3113.</p>

<h3 id="duty-of-care">Duty of care</h3>

<p>You have a legal responsibility to ensure your business waste is handled safely by authorised personnel only. This is known as your duty of care.</p>

<h3 id="fly-tipping">Fly-tipping</h3>

<p>Fly-tipping is the illegal dumping of waste on land that is not a licensed disposal site. Fly-tipping poses a threat to health and the environment and is expensive to clean up.</p>

<p>As a farmer, you may become a victim of fly-tipping. If you see someone fly-tipping on your land:</p>

<ul>
<li>don’t approach them - they may turn violent</li>
  <li>don’t touch the waste - it could be hazardous</li>
  <li>make a note of the date, time, location, a description of the waste and any vehicle involved</li>
  <li>report the incident to your local authority and the Environment Agency Incident Hotline on: 0800 80 70 60</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1081597476&amp;r.l2=1082184851&amp;r.l3=1083731942&amp;r.l4=1083595388&amp;topicId=1074537118">Find contact details for your local authority through our Contacts Directory</a>.</p>

<p>As well as it being illegal to fly-tip, there are also some other rules that apply, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is an offence to permit or authorise fly-tipping</li>
  <li>the driver and/or owner of a vehicle used for fly-tipping can be prosecuted, and police can seize the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the Environment Agency and local authorities have powers to tackle fly-tipping. The Environment Agency investigates larger-scale incidents involving organised gangs of fly-tippers.</p>

<h2 id="giving-or-receiving-waste-for-composting">Giving or receiving waste for composting</h2>

<p>If someone else takes your waste for composting, then you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>check they can prove that they are authorised to carry waste</li>
  <li>ensure that the waste is being taken to a properly authorised site</li>
  <li>give them a transfer note including a description of the waste, signed by both parties, and keep copies for at least two years</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take waste from someone else for composting on your farm, then you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure that you are allowed by law to take it - you can check this by contacting the Environment Agency Helpline on: 03708 506 506</li>
  <li>check that the person giving you the waste has described it in writing</li>
  <li>ensure that both parties have completed and signed a transfer note</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also note that catering waste and animal by-products must not be brought onto premises where livestock are kept.</p>

<h3 id="storing-and-managing-waste-for-composting">Storing and managing waste for composting</h3>

<p>The Environmental Protection (Duty of Care) Regulations state that compost material must be stored securely and kept safe against accidental spilling or leaking. You should not allow liquids to escape into watercourses, and you must keep stored liquid waste in a sealed container for recycling or disposal.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-packaging-waste-and-other-plastics">Dealing with packaging waste and other plastics</h2>

<p>Waste from packaging and other plastics can be a pollution risk and can add to the amount of material for landfill. Packaging materials include plastics, paper, glass and metals. Plastic waste includes silage wrap, crop cover and tree guards.</p>

<p>Packaging waste intended for composting must be biodegradable and must not interfere with the collection of waste or the composting process itself. To be biodegradable, the packaging must decompose into carbon dioxide, biomass and water.</p>

<p>The key issues regarding packaging waste you must be aware of include:</p>

<ul>
<li>reducing packaging - you can save money and prevent waste by reducing the amount of packaging you use, eg by ordering supplies in larger containers. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=25604&amp;id=25605">Download Defra waste minimisation tips from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 725K)</a>.</li>
  <li>reusing materials - you can reuse plastics and packaging. For example, you can use last year’s silage sheet for lining the clamp shoulder or as a groundsheet.</li>
  <li>recycling of materials</li>
  <li>disposing of packaging - the Duty of Care applies to everyone involved in handling the waste your farm produces</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="packaging-regulations">Packaging regulations</h3>

<p>The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations apply to you if your business handles more than 50 tonnes of packaging in a year and has a turnover of more than £2 million. These Regulations mean you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>register with the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>pay to recover and recycle specified tonnages of packaging waste</li>
  <li>supply evidence that you have met your obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you may have to comply with the Producer Responsibility Obligations, you can call the Environment Agency National Waste Registration Unit on: 020 7091 4036.</p>

<h2 id="recycling-farm-waste">Recycling farm waste</h2>

<p>By recycling farm waste, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce the risk of pollution</li>
  <li>reduce the amount of waste going to landfill</li>
  <li>save money</li>
  <li>comply with legislation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-farm-waste-recycling">On-farm waste recycling</h3>

<p>Many materials used on the farm can be recycled. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>scrap metal can be collected from the farm - provided the contractor is registered to carry waste</li>
  <li>demolition rubble can be useful for building farm tracks - as long as it is free of asbestos</li>
  <li>most tyre dealers and fitters will take back used tyres and tyre cases</li>
  <li>you may be able to take batteries, waste oil and paper to a recycling facility, or have it collected by a registered waste contractor</li>
  <li>waste oil can be used for protecting machinery stored over the winter</li>
  <li>clean silage sheet off-cuts should be stored separately, and your supplier may provide a take-back scheme</li>
  <li>waste plastics, such as used silage wrap, can be recycled</li>
  <li>water from dairy processing may be recycled for other farm uses</li>
  <li>some unwanted vegetable and crop produce can be used for livestock or pet food</li>
  <li>your veterinary surgeon may take back used needles and syringes</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.wastedirectory.org.uk/">find contact details for local waste recycling centres on the NetRegs Waste Directory website</a>.</p>

<p>It is also very important that waste for recycling is handled correctly. The correct procedure includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>separating waste by type - eg plastics and metals</li>
  <li>separating different plastics - eg polyethylene and polypropylene</li>
  <li>separating different metals - eg ferrous and non-ferrous</li>
  <li>storing waste securely and protecting it from potential contaminants</li>
  <li>ensuring that the waste stays clean</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Nitrate Vulnerable Zones</h3>

<p>If your land falls within an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>, there may be additional rules that affect your waste and recycling. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/nitrate-vulnerable-zones"><abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3 id="sewage-sludge">Sewage sludge</h3>

<p>Sewage sludge is a controlled waste. It can be used as a fertiliser and soil conditioner, but may also be harmful to the environment if incorrectly applied. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-sewage-sludge-slurry-and-silage">sewage sludge, slurry and silage</a>.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-permits-and-registering-waste-exemptions">Environmental permits and registering waste exemptions</h2>

<p>You may need an environmental permit for your waste activities. Although some activities do not need a permit, they still need to be registered with the Environment Agency. These are called exempt waste activities. If you have a registered exemption, you must comply with specific conditions for that exemption.</p>

<p>Examples of activities that require an exemption include composting plant waste, using wood chips for animal bedding and burning plant matter in the open.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-environmental-permitting-and-exemptions">Changes to environmental permitting and exemptions</h3>

<p>New Environmental Permitting Regulations came into force across England and Wales on 6 April 2010 replaced the list of exempt activities with a new one, which groups exemptions into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘U’ - use of waste - eg spreading compost on land to improve soil</li>
  <li>‘T’ - treatment of waste - eg shredding vegetation and branches to make a mulch</li>
  <li>‘D’ - disposal of waste - eg burning vegetation and branches on a bonfire</li>
  <li>‘S’ - storage of waste - eg storing it according to prescribed requirements until it is required for spreading</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the new exemptions are almost identical to exemptions in the old system and others are similar but have different limits and conditions. You are advised to check, as there are some completely new exemptions. Once your exemptions have been registered, you must renew them every three years. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Business/Changes_to_the_exemption_system_Final.pdf">download a leaflet on how changes to the waste exemption system affect farmers from the Environment Agency website (PDF, 133K)</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an exemption that you registered before 6 April 2010, you will need to re-register it under the new system within a transition period extending until 1 October 2013, although the actual date is determined by the type of waste operation. Throughout this period, you will still need to comply with the limits and conditions of the exemptions you hold under the old system.</p>
