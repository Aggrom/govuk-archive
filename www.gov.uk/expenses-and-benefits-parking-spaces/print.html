  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing parking spaces for your employees, you have certain National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>This covers parking spaces for vehicles including cars, motorcycles and bicycles.</p>

<p>These spaces may be at or near your employee’s workplace, or spaces used while on a ‘business journey’.</p>

<p>A business journey is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>part of your employees duties, eg a service engineer travelling to an appointment</li>
  <li>a journey your employee has to make to get to a temporary workplace</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>There are different rules if you <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-car-parking-charges" title="cover the costs of employees' parking">cover the costs of employees’ parking</a>, rather than providing parking spaces yourself.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report or pay anything to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide parking spaces at or near your employee’s workplace</li>
  <li>provide any parking spaces to employees who earn <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You don’t have to pay tax or National Insurance on parking spaces provided for business journeys, but you may still have to <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-parking-spaces/what-to-report-and-pay" title="report these expenses">report these expenses</a> to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the parking spaces you provide aren’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-parking-spaces" title="exempt">exempt</a>, you may have to report them to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and you may have to pay National Insurance on the cost.</p>

<h2>Spaces you provide for use on business journeys</h2>

<p>If you provide parking spaces for business journeys, you can <a href="/apply-for-a-dispensation" title="apply for a dispensation">apply for a dispensation</a>, which means you won’t have to include them on your end-of-year reports.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a dispensation, and you provide these spaces for employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more a year, or directors, you’ll need to report them on form P11D, section K, L or N.</p>

<p>You don’t have to pay tax or National Insurance on these parking spaces.</p>

<h2>Other parking spaces you provide</h2>

<p>This covers parking spaces you provide that aren’t either:</p>

<ul>
<li>at or near the employee’s workplace</li>
  <li>for use on a business journey</li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide these spaces for employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more a year, or directors, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>report on form P11D, section K, L or M</li>
  <li>pay Class 1A National Insurance on the cost to you of providing the parking space</li>
