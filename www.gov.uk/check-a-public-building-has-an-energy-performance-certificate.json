Find out about a public building's energy use and carbon emissions by checking the Display Energy Certificate (DEC).$!\r\n\r\n##What a Display Energy Certificate will tell you \r\n\r\nDisplay Energy Certificates (DECs) are designed to show the energy performance of public buildings.\r\n\r\nThey use a scale that runs from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018G\u2019 - \u2018A\u2019 being the most efficient and \u2018G\u2019 being the least. DECs are updated every year.\r\n\r\n$D[Download an example DEC (PDF, 253KB)](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/768325.pdf \"Example of a Display Energy Certificate (PDF, 253KB)\"){:rel=\"external\"} $D\r\n\r\n##Buildings that need a certificate\r\n\r\nA building must have a DEC if it:\r\n\r\n- is occupied by public authorities, eg local government, school, prisons\r\n- is an institution providing a public services to a large number of people, eg a library\r\n- has a floor area of over 1,000 metres squared \r\n- is frequently visited by the public \r\n\r\n##Where to find the certificate\r\n\r\nA DEC should be on display in a prominent place clearly visible to the public, eg near the entrance to the building. If an organisation doesn't do this they can be fined \u00a3500.  \r\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t find the DEC you should contact the occupier of the building.
