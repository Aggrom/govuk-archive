  </header><p>If you have been injured or disabled as a result of service in HM Armed Forces before 6 April 2005, you may be able to claim War Disablement Pension.</p>


</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>The amount you’re paid depends on the degree of your disability.</p>

<p>You’ll need to complete a claim form before the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency checks your service records. The degree of your disability will then be decided by Veterans Agency medical advisers.</p>

<p>Your assessment is worked out as a percentage.</p>

<p>If the percentage is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>more than 20% - you’ll get a pension </li>
  <li>less than 20% - you’ll usually get a lump sum (or gratuity) </li>
</ul>
<p>The gratuity amount depends on the extent of your disablement and how long you’re likely to be disabled. If your condition is hearing loss assessed at less than 20%, you won’t get a gratuity.</p>

<p>In addition to the basic War Disablement Pension (WDP) an additional allowance may be payable dependent on your age. Other allowances can also be claimed for care or mobility or if you are permanently unable to carry on with your regular occupation.</p>

<p>Whether you are entitled to an additional allowance depends on the rate of WDP you have been awarded and other criteria, such as your level of care or mobility needs, or whether you have lost earnings.</p>

<p>For a full list of rates download the leaflet ‘Rates of War Pensions and allowances 2011-2012’ from the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency website.</p>
