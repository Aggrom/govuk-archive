<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Individuals who are able to exercise ‘rights of common’ over another person’s land are generally known as ‘commoners’.</p>

<p>If you own common land, your rights are subject to statutory controls and the commoners’ interests. As commons frequently have large numbers of legal interests involved, reaching agreement on collective management can often be difficult. In response to this, the government has introduced legislation which enables commons to be managed more sustainably.</p>

<p>This guide looks at the main issues surrounding common land, including registration, agricultural management of commons and protection of common land. It also discusses public rights of way and how the management of common land affects issues of Cross Compliance.</p>

<h2 id="rights-of-common">Rights of common</h2>

<p>There are about 550,000 hectares of registered common land in England and Wales - around 373,570 of which are in England - and some 80 per cent is privately owned. Common land is land that is owned by someone, over which someone else - sometimes several other people - are entitled to exercise ‘rights of common’. Someone who owns these rights is known as a ‘commoner’.</p>

<p>Owners have the same basic rights as other landowners, subject to statutory controls and the interests of the commoners.</p>

<p>If you own land that is subject to rights of common, they could include some or all of the rights to:</p>

<ul>
<li>graze sheep or cattle on your land - known as a ‘right of herbage’</li>
  <li>take peat or turf from your land - a ‘right of turbary’</li>
  <li>take wood, gorse or furze from your land - a ‘right of estovers’</li>
  <li>take fish from waterways on your land - a ‘right of piscary’</li>
  <li>allow pigs to eat acorns or beechmast on your land - a ‘right of pannage’</li>
</ul>
<p>Commoners may be either active or inactive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active commoners are those who exercise their rights.</li>
  <li>Inactive commoners do not currently exercise their rights, and may not even be aware of them. However, the legal right still exists if it is registered and may be exercised at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rights-over-your-land">Rights over your land</h3>

<p>Rights of common are usually attached to nearby properties, and the occupiers of those properties are entitled to exercise them. However, they are generally not tradable commodities. When occupiers leave those properties, they do not take their rights with them - the new occupiers can exercise them instead. Some rights are not attached to properties - these are called ‘rights in gross’. Commoners will have been required to register the number of animals for which they claimed rights of grazing.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether someone has rights in common over your land, you can check the registers held by commons registrations authorities. </p>

<p>It is not generally possible to sell rights of common separately from the land to which they were attached - a process known as ‘severance’ - there are few limited exceptions to this.</p>

<h2 id="management-of-common-land">Management of common land</h2>

<p>The management of common land must take into account the interests of both the owner and the commoners. Where there is good co-operation amongst active commoners and the owner, the land can be effectively managed and remain a resource for both the owner and the commoners.</p>

<p>However, it is difficult to manage commons where there are few active commoners, and where the owner of the land does not use it. For example, where grazing on land has ceased, it is sometimes difficult to re-introduce it, and where common land is not effectively managed, commoners may not want to use it and its value may be lost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, common land which is over-used - by, for example, being grazed by too many animals - can be seriously damaged.</p>

<p>One of the aims of the Commons Act 2006 is to address the issue of commons management. Historically, many commons have commoners’ committees or associations which meet to discuss issues relating to management. However, these organisations are voluntary, with no force of law or legal status. Therefore, individual commoners can go against the wishes of the majority of their neighbours - for example by refusing to adjust their grazing levels to the general benefit of the site, or by not participating in collaborative management schemes.</p>

<p>The 2006 Act allows self-regulating statutory commons councils to be set up to manage common land at a local level where they can manage their affairs by majority voting. They are set up where there is substantial support among commoners and, where appropriate, landowners. The banning of severance of common rights - with limited exceptions - maintains the link between common rights and the local community. </p>

<h2 id="statutory-commons-councils">Statutory commons councils</h2>

<p>One of the key provisions of the Commons Act 2006 is to allow statutory commons councils to be established. These bodies have powers to manage common land, allowing interested parties - landowners, commoners and the local community - to work together.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that commons councils will be appropriate in a relatively small number of cases, where commons are in agricultural management but where reaching agreement among stakeholders can be difficult.</p>

<p>Usually, the request to set up a council will be made by those with legal interests in the common - ie commoners, landowners and others with statutory rights or obligations on the land. A commons council can only be established if the Secretary of State has concluded that there is substantial support. This can be decided by a public inquiry.</p>

<p>The Commons Act recognises that commons have different needs, so each council is separately established with its own establishment order - although the Act does provide that a standard constitution must be incorporated for each council.</p>

<p>Commons councils can be set up with responsibility for single commons. However, they are likely to have more resources and be more useful if they incorporate several commons - eg Dartmoor Commons Council. They will allow all interested parties to work together to improve management of agricultural activities, vegetation and the exercise of common rights on the land.</p>

<h3 id="powers-of-commons-councils">Powers of commons councils</h3>

<p>Commons councils have the power to make rules, by majority voting, that are binding on everyone with legal interests in the common. This can also help commons access funding schemes by acting as a single voice when negotiating commons management and ensuring that Cross Compliance requirements are observed by everyone.</p>

<p>In addition, commons councils can:</p>

<ul>
<li>share information and help interested parties to work together</li>
  <li>decide whether and for how long common rights can be leased</li>
  <li>provide a mediation service when breaches occur</li>
  <li>keep live registers of stock</li>
  <li>negotiate with the Rural Payments Agency</li>
  <li>lobby to improve policies in relation to commons</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commons-registration-authorities">Commons registration authorities</h2>

<p>Commons registration authorities (<abbr title="Commons registration authorities">CRAs</abbr>) - generally county councils - were established by the Commons Registration Act 1965. They are responsible for keeping registers of common land and of town or village greens, along with information about rights over registered land.</p>

<p>County councils, metropolitan borough councils and London borough councils act as <abbr title="Commons registration authorities">CRAs</abbr>, and their main role is to maintain the registers, conduct searches, handle applications for amendments, such as removing common land from the registers, and register new town and village greens.</p>

<p>Commons registers are open for public inspection, and an appointment is not usually needed, although it is worth checking. There is no charge for having a copy of a registry entry, although the registration authority may charge for making a physical photocopy.</p>

<h3 id="accuracy-of-registers">Accuracy of registers</h3>

<p>The Commons Act 2006 introduced new responsibilities for <abbr title="Commons registration authorities">CRAs</abbr>, including the requirement to update and maintain registers.</p>

<p>Following an extensive pilot scheme, <abbr title="Commons registration authorities">CRAs</abbr> will have a legal responsibility to keep registers up to date, and will have powers to correct mistakes in existing registers. You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/commonland/registration.htm">find archived information about progress on common land registration on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rights-of-public-access-on-common-land">Rights of public access on common land</h2>

<p>The public have statutory rights of access on nearly all registered common land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (<abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr>) Act 2000. These rights are different to public rights of way and are known as ‘<abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> rights’ (also popularly referred to as the ‘right to roam’).</p>

<p>The public are entitled to walk generally on registered common land without confinement to paths. This access is often subject to certain common sense restrictions - eg not leaving gates open or lighting fires.</p>

<p>Right of access on common land are taken to include activities such as walking, sightseeing, bird watching, picnicking, climbing and running. The <abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> Act does not convey the right to participate in cycling, fishing, horse riding, camping or driving a vehicle.</p>

<p>Occupiers who have an agreement under the Environmental Stewardship (ES) scheme must maintain existing rights of way and abide by the relevant legislation. You can find more about the scheme in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/entry-level-stewardship">Entry Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.gov.uk/ourwork/farming/funding/es/els/default.aspx">find out about Uplands <abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr> on the Natural England website</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/enjoying/places/openaccess/default.aspx">read about Open Access land and view maps and guidance on the Natural England website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="restricting-access-to-common-land">Restricting access to common land</h3>

<p>Landowners are entitled to give notice restricting access to common land for up to 28 days each year without application, except for:</p>

<ul>
<li>bank holidays</li>
  <li>more than four Saturdays a year between June and August</li>
  <li>more than four Sundays a year between June and September</li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan to restrict access to common land, you should notify the Open Access Contact Centre on 0845 100 3298.</p>

<p>You may also apply to make further restrictions for purposes of land management, fire prevention or public safety. You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/commonland/index.htm">find information on common land restrictions on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone who uses your land has a responsibility to take normal precautions to prevent damage or danger to land or livestock. On <abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> access land all dogs must be kept on short, fixed leads of no more than 2 metres in length between 1 March and 31 July, and at any time when they are near livestock. You also have powers to exclude dogs from small enclosures used for lambing or across grouse moors. It is an offence to allow a dog to attack or chase livestock.</p>

<p>However, you cannot use <abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> restrictions on certain areas having access rights that pre-date the <abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> Act. The earlier rights were registered in Section 15 of the <abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> Act - and are known as section 15 land. Section 15 land has precedence over <abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> rights where they overlap with mapped open country, registered common land, or land dedicated for access under Section 15 of the Act.</p>

<h3 id="crow-rights-and-public-liability">
<abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> rights and public liability</h3>

<p>As a landowner, you have a reduced level of public liability on access land. You cannot be sued for any damage or injury caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>any natural feature of the landscape - including any trees, shrubs, plants, or any rivers, streams, ditches or ponds, whether natural or man-made</li>
  <li>people passing over, under or through any wall, fence gate, except by proper use of the gate or stile</li>
</ul>
<p>This does not include instances where a landowner sets out to create a risk or allows a risk to pose a danger to the public.</p>

<p>However, if an animal injures someone or causes damage on <abbr title="Countryside and Rights of Way Act">CRoW</abbr> access land, you may be liable if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the animal should have been restrained as it was likely to cause injury or damage</li>
  <li>the injury or damage caused was or could have been severe</li>
  <li>the animal’s characteristics are abnormal in that species, except at particular times or in particular circumstances</li>
  <li>you or the person keeping the animals knew that the animal posed a risk</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are concerned about your liability, you should seek legal advice. You can also apply for a restriction of public access on your land to protect the public if you are aware of any possible risk - eg during calving.</p>

<h2 id="cross-compliance-and-common-land">Cross Compliance and common land</h2>

<p>If you claim agricultural payments under the Single Payment Scheme, you must comply fully with the Cross Compliance rules across all of your agricultural land - not just that on which you claim payments.</p>

<p>Good agricultural and environmental conditions (<abbr title="Good agricultural and environmental conditions">GAECs</abbr>) are statutory requirements for you to keep your land in good condition and to maintain habitat and landscape that are important to the English countryside. This applies equally to any common land that you manage - the only practical difference is that good condition is dependent on all stakeholders (owner and commoners) working collaboratively. In some circumstances, Soil Protection Reviews will not be necessary on common land.</p>

<p>For more information on <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> and Cross Compliance, see the guides on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cross-compliance-the-basics">Cross Compliance: the basics</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/standards-of-good-agricultural-and-environmental-condition">standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="works-on-common-land">Works on common land</h2>

<p>Under Section 38 of the Commons Act 2006, it is an offence to carry out ‘restricted works’ without permission on any common land that you own or manage. Restricted works are defined as:</p>

<ul>
<li>works which prevent or impede access to or over common land - eg erecting fences, digging trenches or constructing buildings or embankments</li>
  <li>any resurfacing work involving laying down new concrete, tarmacadam or similar material</li>
</ul>
<p>You will not need permission if you are repairing an existing surface using the same material - eg using concrete to mend cracks in an existing concrete path.</p>

<p>If you want to carry out restricted works on your common land, you should apply to the Planning Inspectorate for permission. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/pins/common_land/forms/section_38_application_form.pdf">download an application form for consent to construct works on common land from the Planning Inspectorate website (PDF, 175KB)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/countryside/commonland/guidance">find common land guidance sheets on the Planning Inspectorate website</a>.</p>
