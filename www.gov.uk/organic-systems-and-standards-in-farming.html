<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Organic farming is a whole system or holistic way of producing food, which strongly focuses on the effects of farming activities on the soil, crops and livestock it sustains, the quality of food under production, and the wider environment.</p>

<p>As an organic farmer or grower, you should aim, as far as possible, to achieve a closed system, keeping external inputs and waste outputs to a minimum, recycling where possible and using manure from livestock as a resource.</p>

<p>This guide sets out the organic standards and systems which you must maintain to operate as an approved organic crop and/or livestock farmer. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) is the authority responsible for organic farming regulations in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="how-organic-systems-differ-from-non-organic-systems">How organic systems differ from non-organic systems</h2>

<p>Organic farming differs in many areas from standard (non-organic) farming. The main components of an organic farming system are:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoiding artificial fertilisers and pesticides</li>
  <li>using crop rotation and other forms of husbandry to maintain soil fertility </li>
  <li>controlling weeds, pests and diseases using appropriate husbandry techniques and where necessary approved materials to control pests and disease</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on differences between organic and non-organic farming see the guide on converting to organic farming.</p>

<p>For more detail on organic standards, see the guide on organic certification and standards.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264734&amp;id=264735">Download guidance on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic regulations from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 437K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="eu-regulations">
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulations</h3>

<p>Organic production is strictly regulated under harmonised <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules.</p>

<p>All foods sold as organic must originate from organic operators who are registered with an approved <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> and subject to regular inspection. You must be registered as an organic operator if you are a grower, farmer, processor and/or importer of organic food.</p>

<p>Organic control bodies (<abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr>) license individual growers and producers. For more information on the approved <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> and how to register, see the guide on converting to organic farming.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/growing/organic/standards/certbodies/approved.htm">find a list of the approved UK <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="requirements-common-to-organic-and-non-organic-farming">Requirements common to organic and non-organic farming</h3>

<p>You will also need to check whether your land is in a nitrate protection zone and how this might affect your farm management. The Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (<abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr>) Action Programme is one of the Statutory Management Requirements under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>). You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.magic.gov.uk/">find out whether your land is in an <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> with the interactive mapping tool on the MAGIC website</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/54714.aspx">read <abbr title="Nitrate Vulnerable Zone">NVZ</abbr> guidance on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="livestock-identification-and-movement">Livestock identification and movement</h3>

<p>For more information on the rules which apply to identifying and moving livestock and keeping records of both activities, see the guide on cattle identification, registration and movement.</p>

<h3 id="importing-or-exporting-organic-produce">Importing or exporting organic produce</h3>

<p>For information on organic imports, including how to apply for Certificates of Conformity for organic fruit, vegetables and nuts from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, see the guide on importing organic produce.</p>

<p>Although a Certificate of Inspection (<abbr title="Certificate of Inspection">CoI</abbr>) must accompany imports of organic produce from countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, CoIs are verifiable either at the place of import or at an inland location away from the initial port of entry.</p>

<p>You can check how the rules compare with those for importing or exporting non-organic farming produce in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/agriculture-horticulture-and-fisheries-import-and-export">Agriculture, horticulture and fisheries: import and export</a>.</p>

<h2 id="organic-standards">Organic standards</h2>

<p>Organic standards specify the inputs and practices permitted for use in organic farming and growing, and the inspection system that member states must have in place to ensure compliance with the standards.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic standards apply to organic crop and livestock farmers and to certain organic food operators who must be registered as such - ie businesses that produce, prepare, store, import from a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, or market organic products, including those who make processed foods such as ready meals. <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264734&amp;id=264735">Download guidance on how <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organic regulations apply from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 437K)</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/growing/organic/">read more about organic standards on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> license individual growers and producers. For more information on <abbr title="organic control bodies">CBs</abbr> and how to register, see the guide on converting to organic farming.</p>

<h3 id="organic-systems-and-the-need-for-standards">Organic systems and the need for standards</h3>

<p>Organic standards set out the practical steps through which farmers can achieve a closed, sustainable system which produces food, cares for the soil and land, wildlife and biodiversity, and local communities.</p>

<p>Organic standards apply to all areas of organic production - ie from farm to fork. However, there are no specific standards for organic wine and the term ‘organic wine’ cannot legally exist, as it is not defined in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law. It is possible to label wine as being ‘made from organically grown grapes’.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-cope-until-your-farm-is-approved">How to cope until your farm is approved</h3>

<p>If you are short of organic livestock, feedstuffs, forage, land or grazing - or have surpluses you wish to sell - you can do so by registering with the Soil Association’s organic marketplace to find what you need or advertise your offerings up to four months ahead of their availability. This is a free service available to all UK organic farmers. <a rel="external" href="http://92.52.112.178/web/sa/om.nsf/homepage?openform">Find out how you can buy or sell resources on the Soil Association organic marketplace website</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on converting to organic farming, see the guide on organic certification and standards.</p>

<h2 id="organic-crop-systems">Organic crop systems</h2>

<p>One of the key aims of an organic farming system is to produce a profitable output of organic cash crops and/or livestock built on optimal rather than maximum yields.</p>

<p>The key elements of organic crop systems are set out below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintaining soil fertility and structure based on crop rotation - including at least two years of a fertility-building crop such as a grass or clover ley. But the use of animal manures composts and certain low solubility natural fertlisers can be used where a fertility-building crop is not suffient to achieve an effective nutrient balance.</li>
  <li>Organic seed - you will need to consult the <a rel="external" href="http://www.organicxseeds.com/oxs/do/Login?paramCountry=188">OrganicXseeds database on the Soil Association website</a> to check the availability of organic seed for the particular crop you wish to grow. Where organic seed is unavailable, you will need to get permission from your control body to use non-organic seed. The use of genetically modified seed is banned in organic production.</li>
  <li>Crop nutrition - how you use on-farm manures and nitrogen-fixing leguminous crops to increase crop fertility. In some instances, you may be allowed to bring in manures and organic fertilisers or mineral products, such as rock potash and rock phosphate.</li>
  <li>Crop protection - how you achieve pest, weed and disease control by using a combination of crop rotations of carefully chosen varieties, and how you time crop cultivations and manage their habitat to encourage natural predators. If there is an immediate threat to crops and you have to directly get involved, you may, subject to strict criteria, use a very limited range of products, such as sulphur. The use of all herbicides is banned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organic farming systems also aim to:</p>

<ul>
<li>increase biodiversity on farms and in the landscape at large</li>
  <li>make more efficient use of energy resources</li>
  <li>improve water efficiency and water quality</li>
  <li>reduce nitrate pollution</li>
  <li>reduce emissions of ammonia, carbon dioxide and methane</li>
  <li>reduce levels of controlled waste</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organic-livestock-systems">Organic livestock systems</h2>

<p>As organic farms aim to be self-sustaining, livestock is essential to most organic systems, although there are some successful stockless systems. As with organic crop systems, organic livestock systems aim for optimising rather than maximising production.</p>

<h3 id="animal-welfare-and-well-being">Animal welfare and well-being</h3>

<p>The welfare and well-being of animals - whether kept for producing dairy, meat or eggs - is one of the driving principles of organic livestock farming.</p>

<p>Under organic standards: </p>

<ul>
<li>you have free choice of breed, but the breed you choose must be appropriate for the location and physical conditions - such as climate and food supply - you have available</li>
  <li>you are not allowed to have the same livestock species on both organic and conventional units on the same farm</li>
  <li>you must not allow non-organic livestock to graze on organic land, except for a limited period (120 days per year)</li>
  <li>you must have a preventive health plan in writing and in use - you should check whether this is available from your <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you must have a policy for breeding and replacing animals - you will need permission from your <abbr title="organic control body">CB</abbr> to use animals from a non-organic source and artificial insemination is allowed but embryo transfer is not</li>
  <li>you must provide housed animals with accommodation and bedding according to the needs of that particular species</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comply with prescribed stocking densities for the livestock’s comfort and to avoid having to bring in a large amount of feed.</li>
  <li>Provide an appropriate diet at all times, making sure that the feed ration is in accordance with organic regulations.</li>
  <li>Make sure that all livestock - including pigs and poultry - have access to the outdoors (weather permitting).</li>
  <li>Restrict the use of veterinary medicines to circumstances where the health or welfare of an animal is at risk or they are the only way to restore its full health. Except where homeopathic medicines are used, or in the case of vaccination, the animal’s product must not be sold for a period after treatment has finished. The withdrawal period for organic produce is normally twice as long as that for non-organic produce.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on converting your existing dairy, beef and sheep enterprises to an organic system, or for bringing in conventional chicks to produce organic birds, see the guide on converting to organic farming.</p>

<p>As well as complying with the organic requirements, you should also follow general animal health and welfare procedures that are not specific to organic farming.</p>

<p>For information on the rules and good practice governing the welfare of the species of animal that you are farming, see the guides on cattle welfare, pig welfare and sheep and goat welfare.</p>
