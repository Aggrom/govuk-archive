If you send your tax return too close to this deadline, you may not get your statement on time to tell you what to pay. \r\n\r\nTo make sure you pay the right amount of tax you may need to work out your [balancing payment](balancing-payments \"Balancing payments\") and what payments on account you need to make for the next tax year.

For example, through your tax code. \r\n\r\nIf the payments on account you've made are higher than your tax bill, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) will refund you the difference. \r\n\r\n##What and when to pay\r\n\r\nEach payment is half your previous year\u2019s tax bill. Your payments are due on 31 January and 31 July. \r\n\r\n$E **Example**  \r\nYou\u2019re self-employed and the tax due for 2011 to 2012 tax year is \u00a31,500.
