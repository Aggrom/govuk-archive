  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>A deputy is someone appointed to make decisions for someone who is unable to do so on their own.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act/index.htm" title="Mental Capacity Act">Mental Capacity Act</a> is used to work out if someone can make their own decisions and how they can be helped.</p>

<h2>Who can be a deputy</h2>

<p>A deputy is usually a close friend or relative of the person who needs help making decisions. </p>

<p>A deputy can also be a professional, like an accountant or a solicitor.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Deputies must be over 18.</p>
</div>

<p>The Court of Protection can appoint a ‘panel deputy’ to look after someone’s financial affairs if no one else can do this.</p>

<p>A panel deputy is someone with specialist knowledge of mental capacity law.</p>

</article><article id="responsibilities"><header><h1>Part 2: Responsibilities</h1>
  </header><p>The Court of Protection will tell the deputy about:</p>

<ul>
<li>their powers and responsibilities</li>
  <li>what decisions they can and can’t make - eg about money or healthcare</li>
</ul>
<p>Deputies must:</p>

<ul>
<li>only make decisions in the other person’s best interests</li>
  <li>only make the decisions the court says they can make</li>
  <li>apply a high standard of care when making decisions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions a deputy cannot make</h2>

<p>Deputies can’t make a decision for someone if:</p>

<ul>
<li>they believe the person can make the decision without their help</li>
  <li>it goes against a decision made by an attorney acting under a Lasting Power of Attorney</li>
</ul>
<p>Deputies can’t:</p>

<ul>
<li>restrain the person, unless it’s to stop them coming to harm</li>
  <li>stop life-sustaining medical treatment, eg turn off a life-support machine</li>
  <li>make a will for the person, or change their existing will</li>
  <li>make large gifts out of the person’s money</li>
  <li>hold any money or property in their own name on the person’s behalf</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a deputy can use the <a href="/court-funds-office-processes" title="Court Funds Office">Court Funds Office</a>, or a bank or building society account to help someone with their finances.</p>
