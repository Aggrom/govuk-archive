This is called a 'Feed-in Tariff' (FIT). \r\n\r\n##How the scheme works\r\n\r\nYou'll get a set amount for each unit (kilowatt hour or kWh) of electricity you generate. The rates vary depending on:\r\n\r\n- the size of your system\r\n- what technology you install\r\n- when your technology was installed\r\n- who put the technology in place - you need to use a [certified installer](http://www.microgenerationcertification.org/installers \"certified installer\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\nContact installer companies or an electricity supplier for more information. You can receive payments from your current energy supplier, or you can choose a different one from the [list of registered suppliers.](http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/SUSTAINABILITY/ENVIRONMENT/FITS/RFITLS/Pages/rfitls.aspx \"Registered FIT Licensed Suppliers\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n\r\n##The export tariff - selling surplus energy \r\n\r\nAs well as the generation tariff, you can also sell any extra units you don't use back to your electricity supplier. This is called an 'export tariff'. \r\n\r\nYou'll get 4.5p per unit of electricity:\r\n\r\n- for solar panels where you applied for FIT on or after 1 August 2012\r\n- for other technologies where you applied for FIT on or after 1 December 2012\r\n\r\nIf you applied for FIT before these dates you'll continue to get 3.2p for each unit of electricity. \r\n\r\n\r\n##How much you could get\r\n\r\nUse the Energy Saving Trust calculators to estimate how much you could earn using the FIT scheme and selling unused energy back. \r\n\r\nUse the:\r\n\r\n- [solar energy calculator](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Solar-panels-PV/Solar-Energy-Calculator \"solar energy calculator\"){:rel=\"external\"} if you want to install solar panels\r\n- or the [cashback calculator](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Financial-incentives/Cashback-Calculator \"cashback calculator\"){:rel=\"external\"} if you're considering installing wind turbines, hydroelectricity or micro combined heat and power systems\r\n\r\n*[FIT]:Feed-in Tariff","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"To qualify, your installation must have a peak output of no more than 5 megawatts (MW). Technologies covered are:\r\n\r\n- solar photovoltaic (PV) panels\r\n- wind turbines\r\n- water turbines\r\n- anaerobic digestion (biogas energy)\r\n- micro combined heat and power (micro-CHP)\r\n\r\nBefore you apply, do a [home energy check](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/In-your-home/Home-Energy-Check \"home energy check\"){:rel=\"external\"} to make sure your home is as energy-efficient as possible. \r\n\r\ns1.
