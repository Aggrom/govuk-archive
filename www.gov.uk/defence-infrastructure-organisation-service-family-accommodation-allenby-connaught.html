<h2 id="allenbyconnaught-project-summary">Allenby/Connaught project summary</h2>

<p>Project Allenby/Connaught has one simple mission – to make life better for some 18,700 soldiers (nearly 20% of the British Army) by providing modern, high quality, fully serviced, purpose-built living and working accommodation. The contract was awarded to Aspire Defence Limited, a joint venture between Carillion and KBR, in April 2006.</p>

<p>In addition to a major £1.45Bn, 8-year construction programme involving the new build or refurbishment of 562 buildings and the demolition of 496, the 35 year project encompasses a wide range of support services including catering, cleaning, transport, estate management, document production and handling, stores and waste disposal. The Project has a total through life value of some £8Bn and covers Army Garrisons across Salisbury Plain and at Aldershot.</p>

<p>On average, one new building is delivered to the Army each week. Buildings include offices, stores, training facilities, dining centres, sports and leisure facilities, but the core is 261 accommodation units and in all the project will deliver or maintain 11,500 single en-suite bedspaces for single soldiers.
This is not just a “quick fix”. Buildings will not be allowed to degenerate and they will be maintained throughout the life of the contract.</p>

<p>A key feature of the contract is the help desk physically located at each of the garrisons. The help desk provides a telephone, walk in and email point of contact for advice and assistance on all of the services that Aspire are responsible for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The helpdesks receive an average of 5,600 calls per month of which in excess of 98% are answered within 30 seconds.</p>

<ul>
<li>in the first six years since the project began over 9,000 bedspaces have been delivered</li>
  <li>466 new and refurbished buildings constructed and 423 demolitions completed with 97% re-use of material</li>
  <li>over 2m meals served annually</li>

<h3 id="information-on-the-agreement-reached-with-aspire-defence-limited---april-2006">Information on the agreement reached with Aspire Defence Limited - April 2006</h3>

<p>Agreement on Land Command’s Project Allenby/Connaught, the largest estates Private Finance Initiative project the MOD has ever undertaken, has been reached with Aspire Defence Limited. The contract, which will last for 35 years, will provide modern living and working accommodation for some 18000 military and civilian personnel in Aldershot Garrison and in garrisons located in the Salisbury Plain Training Area. It has a particular focus on Single Living Accommodation providing nearly 11000 single en-suite bedspaces. It will also include new dining facilities, theatres and community centres offering a high street style experience to Army personnel. The Project also encompasses a number of other support services including domestic services, estate management, document production and handling, stores, transport and waste disposal.</p>

<p>Service delivery commenced across the project footprint during July 2006, starting at Tidworth, Netheravon and Bulford Garrison on 10 July, Aldershot Garrison on 17 July and in Larkhill and Warminster Garrisons on 24 July.  381 civil service posts have TUPE transferred.  This followed the formal 90-day TU consultation period, which commenced on 31 March 2006.  There have been no redundancies as a result of this transfer.</p>

<h3 id="preserving-the-past">Preserving the past</h3>

<p>Many buildings on the <abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr> site at Tidworth date back to the early 1900’s. </p>

<p>Although many are due to be refurbished a large number of them have been demolished to allow for the provision of 21st century living accommodation. </p>

<p>To allow the demolition programme to proceed, it was agreed with English Heritage that a comprehensive historic building recording programme should be completed. </p>

<p>The programme, now complete, ensured the layout, structure and form of the buildings was recorded for posterity.  It involved surveys and photography to record the important features, their setting and relationships to each other. </p>

<p>Together with this historic record a set of buildings within the Jellalabad barracks complex have been retained and formally listed in order to preserve them as a representative example of the military barracks of the Edwardian period.</p>

<p>The building recording programme was carried out using leading edge laser scanning technology which allows virtual ‘fly throughs’ of the site to show the layout and format of the site before demolition began.</p>

<p>The use of state-of-the–art recording techniques represents one of the largest digital scanning programmes to be carried out in Europe and will preserve a visual presentation of how the site looked for posterity. </p>

<p>Our commitment towards preserving significant artefacts was clearly illustrated in January 2007 when an excavator was carrying out a soil strip in Bhurtpore Barracks, Tidworth.<br>
He uncovered what turned out to be three Bronze Age pots full of human bone fragments.  </p>

<p>The area was sealed off to allow Wessex Archaeology to investigate the find.  They confirmed that the graves were 3,500 years old, making them the oldest finds from Tidworth. </p>

<p>Due to the close relationships that had developed between the parties there is a combined mutually agreed procedure to be followed in the event of such a find on site.  The twin interests of documenting and preserving this significant archaeological find, and maintaining progress on a major construction programme were both satisfied. Work resuming on the site within 2 days.</p>

<h2 id="army-takes-delivery-of-200th-building-in-bulford">Army takes delivery of 200th building in Bulford</h2>

<p>Project Allenby/Connaught delivers the 200th building since the Project started in March 2006.</p>

<p>A Senior Non-Commissioned Officers single living accommodation block became the 200th building to be accepted into service by the Ministry of Defence under Project Allenby/Connaught – the 35 year contract through which Aspire Defence, a joint venture between KBR and Carillion, is replacing and improving Army living and working accommodation across the garrisons of Salisbury Plain and Aldershot. </p>

<p>The building, dating back to the early 1970’s and located in Picton Barracks, Bulford, has been substantially refurbished to bring it up to 21st century standards with former 2 and 3 man rooms converted into 29 single en-suite rooms with modern finishes, furniture and fittings.  Gone are the communal washrooms which have been converted into utility rooms, baggage stores and living out changing facilities. This newly refurbished accommodation block will be occupied by members of the Sergeants Mess 4 Military Intelligence Battalion.</p>

<p>The handover marks a significant milestone for Aspire Defence and the Ministry of Defence. In a little over 3 years 200 buildings including living accommodation, restaurants, regimental headquarters, messes, armouries, stores and leisure facilities have been built or refurbished, with on average, more than one new building being completed each week. </p>

<p>Once handed over, they are maintained by Aspire Defence Services Limited which provides a very broad range of services:  from technical stores management to tailoring of uniforms, from the provision of transport to catering – in fact just about everything needed to run a military garrison other than the physical security and guarding. These services will continue to be delivered for the full 35 year term of the contract.  These improvements are helping to make soldiers lives better by creating a modern living and working environment on the garrisons.</p>

<p>Doug Weidner, the MoD’s Project Manager, commented that, “To deliver 200 buildings in just over three years, on time and in some cases ahead of schedule, is a great credit to all those involved with this landmark project, which really is making soldiers lives better. The MOD and Aspire set out to provide, on average, one building a week, and here we are delivering on that commitment and indeed exceeding it.”</p>

<p>Peter Smart, Chief Executive, Aspire Defence said, “This is an important achievement in what is a continuing success story. With 200 buildings delivered, we now have close to 3,600 soldiers living in the new accommodation. That means a step change to the quality of life for those people and a real sense of satisfaction for all of those in Aspire Defence and the MoD who have worked so hard to bring this about”.</p>

<p>In all, in excess of 540 new and refurbished buildings, including 105 in Bulford, will be delivered and serviced under Project Allenby/Connaught, creating campus – style communities with high quality accommodation, amenities and services for some 18,700 soldiers – 20% of the British Army.</p>

<p>Aspire Defence continues to manage the changes, carrying out demolition and construction on numerous sites across the garrisons often working alongside the Army as they continue their everyday activities. Diggers and dumper trucks can often be seen next to tanks, horses and soldiers everyday operating in a safe and considerate environment.</p>

<h2 id="bats-in-line-for-a-good-nights-sleep-at-new-army-barracks">Bats in line for a good night’s sleep at new Army barracks</h2>

<p>As children up and down the land prepare to celebrate Halloween the Army have been doing their bit to ensure that one of the creatures most closely associated with the annual ghoulish celebration - the bat - will soon be able to look forward to a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p>Some of the buildings at the Army’s latest purpose-built new barracks at Tidworth in Wiltshire have been specially designed to help house protected bats meaning soldiers aren’t the only ones to benefit from them.</p>

<p>Over 700 special ‘bat bricks’ – designed to mimic the bats natural habitat of cracks and crevasses - are being installed as part of a 35-year £8 billion rebuilding programme that is seeing new barracks and military offices being put up around Wiltshire and Hants. </p>

<p>The bat bricks (essentially bricks with holes in them for bats to roost in) along with cavity voids, partitioned loft spaces and squeeze boxes, are placed in the brickwork and lofts of the barracks where bats may roost.</p>

<p>Bats are a protected species and ensuring they have new roosts is an important part of the refurbishment and rebuilding programme which is seeing old Victorian barracks being replaced by state-of-the-art new ones.</p>

<p>It may seem ‘batty’ but the commitment to look after the bats is just one of a number of innovative environmental initiatives put in place by the MOD and the contractor, Aspire Defence.  Rainwater is collected and used in the building process and thermal panels have been used to help provide hot water.  Over 90% of the waste from the old demolished buildings will be reused on the site.</p>

<p>MOD spokesman Paul Munro said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking after the bats is one of a number of initiatives we and Aspire Defence have undertaken to help look after the environment.  It is important we look after bats such as the brown long eared and common pipistrelles.  It is a huge project and we commission a survey by a licensed bat worker of every old buildings before it is demolished and make sure there are new bat roosts in the modern accommodation buildings to compensate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Defence Estates have set up a number of projects in recent years to protect wildlife.  A project to protect a bronze age burial site on MOD land from a clan of badgers, while resettling the badgers at the same time, won the MOD’s 2007 Sanctuary Award.  The Sanctuary Awards recognise both groups and individual efforts towards conservation of MOD land in the UK or overseas.</p>

<h2 id="commander-in-chief-visits-new-barracks-for-royal-engineers">Commander in Chief visits new barracks for Royal Engineers</h2>

<p>The Commander in Chief Land Forces, General Sir Peter Wall KCB CBE, visited Perham Down to mark the completion of the newly rebuilt Swinton Barracks - home to 22 and 26 Engineer Regiments, by Project Allenby/Connaught. General Wall was received by the MOD’s Project Manager, Mr Andrew Mathewson and Aspire Defence Limited’s Chief Executive, Peter Smart, before being taken on a tour of the new barracks by the Commanding Officer of 22 Engineer Regiment, Lt Col Andy Noble.</p>

<p>General Wall met soldiers from 22 Engineer Regiment in one of their new modern junior ranks single living accommodation blocks. The soldiers now benefit from living in single en-suite facilities - a far cry from the old barrack rooms with shared ablutions. Each accommodation block provides 36 en-suite bedrooms split into ‘six room flats’ each of which have their own  communal room, kitchen, utility, drying room and space to store extra kit.</p>

<p>22 Engineer Regiment’s Regimental Sergeant Major WO1 (RSM) Padley then invited the Commander in Chief into the new ‘shared facility’ - the Warrant Officer’s and Sergeants Mess where he met mess members and was shown how both regiments use the flexible layout to host individual and joint functions.</p>

<p>The visit concluded at the junior ranks dining centre where General Wall was shown the new catering and dining facilities, as well as the café bar, shop, internet cafe and clubs provided on site for the soldiers. General Wall stated:</p>

<p>I am delighted to be at Perham Down today to mark the completion of a new barracks for 22 and 26 Engineer Regiments. The standard of accommodation – living, working and recreational - is nothing short of first class. The guaranteed maintenance element of the contract is also novel and should ensure the continued high standard over time.</p>

<p>Talking to some of the soldiers here today, I was pleased to hear how much they appreciate their new environment, and these superb facilities. This project and others across the country are delivering new campus-style barracks, with en suite accommodation – just what we need for our people in the 21st century.</p>

<p>I served at Perham Down when it was first built in 1975. That barracks had run its course and had become dilapidated and unsuitable over 30 plus years. The transformation here under Allenby/Connaught has been spectacular, and we have similar progress elsewhere under this project. There is of course a long way to go to ensure that all our soldiers are provided with the very best living and working accommodation but this is an important step down that path.</p>

<p>Peter Smart, Aspire chief executive said “All in all it’s a great achievement in a little over three years. This is the first complete camp delivered by Project Allenby/Connaught providing soldiers the standard of accommodation they deserve. Across the Project we now have 4000 soldiers living in modern, purpose built single en-suite rooms - just like the soldiers here today. Aspire Defence is proud that the provision of this first class accommodation and supporting services is directly improving the soldiers’ quality of life”.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<p>Many frequently asked questions regarding Project Allenby/Connaught</p>

<h3 id="affordability-and-risk">Affordability and Risk</h3>

<h4 id="how-will-the-mod-ensure-it-gets-value-for-money-this-project-equates-to-a-quarter-of-the-defence-budget">How will the MOD ensure it gets value for money? This project equates to a quarter of the Defence budget.</h4>

<p>It should be noted that expenditure is spread over a 35-year period and needs to be considered in that context. The annual cost of this project is less that 1% of the Defence budget.</p>

<p>A Public Sector Comparator (PSC) was prepared which represented what the MoD would do if a PFI were not an option. The PSC has been used as a benchmark against which the bids from the private sector have been compared to ensure that best value for money is being achieved. Also the contract has been negotiated such that services are periodically benchmarked throughout the life of the contract, thus ensuring continuous value for money.</p>

<h4 id="why-did-you-conclude-that-the-pfi-option-was-the-most-appropriate-option">Why did you conclude that the PFI option was the most appropriate option?</h4>

<p>Aside from the financial benefits, the PFI solution offered a number of qualitative benefits compared to the PSC, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>a single partner providing assured standards over 35 years, underwritten by a taut incentivised payment mechanism</li>
  <li>transfer of key risks, such as planning permission, design maintenance and construction, etc, to the commercial sector</li>
  <li>faster build programme</li>
  <li>enhanced residual value and condition of accommodation at end of contract</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-is-this-project-so-important">Why is this Project so important?</h4>

<p>Together, the Salisbury Plain Training Area and the Aldershot Garrison accommodate nearly 18,000 military personnel. This is nearly 20% of the Army’s overall strength, which underlines the importance of this project to the Army.</p>

<h4 id="how-will-aspire-defence-limited-provide-value-for-money">How will Aspire Defence Limited provide value for money?</h4>

<p>Aspire Defence Limited is a Special Purpose Vehicle set up specifically for the project and brings together Carillion and Kellogg Brown and Root in a consortium. They bring a wealth of experience in managing large scale and long term PFI projects. We are working closely with Aspire and are confident that the contractual obligations placed on both parties will deliver a value for money product.</p>

<p>Under the PFI, Aspire will be responsible for the key construction and support related risks, such as maintenance and through life costs. Performance will be incentivised by a payment mechanism linked to performance and availability.</p>

<p>Services will be subject to benchmarking and/or market testing 10 years after Financial Close and every 7 years thereafter.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-you-be-sure-that-value-for-money-is-being-achieved-when-only-2-bidders-were-considered">How can you be sure that value for money is being achieved when only 2 bidders were considered?</h4>

<p>A number of responses were received as a result of Official Journal of the European Community advertisement. Following a Pre-Qualification exercise three bidders were issued with an Invitation to Negotiate. One bidder withdrew in October 2002 leaving two remaining bidders in the competition, Abraxis and Aspire Defence Limited. Both companies submitted comprehensive bids, which were subject to a full Technical, Financial and Commercial Evaluation, compared at all the stages with the PSC. We are satisfied that this rigorous process has identified a value for money option.</p>

<h4 id="is-this-project-affordable">Is this project affordable?</h4>

<p>Yes. The project remains within affordability levels agreed by Ministers.</p>

<h4 id="given-the-prolonged-negotiations-has-the-affordability-position-worsened">Given the prolonged negotiations has the affordability position worsened?</h4>

<p>No. Negotiations have been complex and lengthy but this has been necessary to ensure that the Project remains affordable and will deliver value for money.</p>

<h4 id="is-the-plan-to-invest-considerable-sums-in-aldershot-and-salisbury-plain-safe">Is the plan to invest considerable sums in Aldershot and Salisbury Plain safe?</h4>

<p>One of the strategic aims set out in Defence Estate Strategy 2006 is to have an estate of the right size to meet the military need. This will be an estate of fewer, larger sites in the UK and overseas, appropriately located and making the best use of available resources while remaining fully capable of meeting military needs. Sites identified as having the potential for future development include Aldershot and Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>The Strategy for the Army Estate contains a concept of “super garrisons” of which Salisbury Plain and Aldershot are two, into which under any future organisational changes the Army will seek to concentrate. Therefore whilst some units might relocate, or be disbanded, they will be back-filled by units from other locations. The requirement for significant investment in the garrisons included within the project footprint is therefore robust.</p>

<h4 id="what-happens-if-there-are-delays-in-the-construction-programme-will-aspire-be-held-financially-to-account">What happens if there are delay’s in the construction programme? Will Aspire be held, financially, to account?</h4>

<p>The Design Build and Transition Plan is very taut, with delay damages imposed if key delivery dates (both construction and land release) are not met and the programmes slips as a result.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-estimated-value-of-the-contract">What is the estimated value of the contract?</h4>

<p>The current estimated value of the potential PFI contract is approximately £1.4 Bn in capital expenditure and a total through life value of circa £8 Bn in today’s money.</p>

<h4 id="how-is-the-money-being-spent">How is the money being spent?</h4>

<p>Approximately half the construction costs will be on new builds, the other half on refurbishment and demolition. The major construction sites will be in Aldershot, Tidworth and Bulford garrisons.</p>

<h3 id="why-pfi-and-background-to-project">Why PFI and Background to Project?</h3>

<h4 id="why-is-this-pfi-attractive-to-a-private-organisation">Why is this PFI attractive to a private organisation?</h4>

<p>Project Allenby/Connaught is a long term venture of 35 years with a scale and diversity that brings efficiencies and gives Aspire Defence Limited the chance to invest in facilities and staff. It also provides a high degree of stability.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-will-the-contract-last">How long will the contract last?</h4>

<p>The term of the PFI contract will be for 35 years.</p>

<h4 id="why-35-years">Why 35 years?</h4>

<p>A range of contract durations were considered, taking into account risk transfer, flexibility, balance and value for money. This concluded that 35 years was the best option. 35 years allows the MOD to transfer life cycle risk.</p>

<p>What are the key milestones?</p>

<ul>
<li>commercial close – March 2006</li>
  <li>contract award – March 2006</li>
  <li>financial close – April 2006</li>
  <li>TUPE transfer – July 2006</li>
  <li>service commencement – July 2006</li>
  <li>return of 2 RTR – July 2007</li>
  <li>completion of construction phase – early 2014</li>
  <li>end of contract - 2041</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-has-it-taken-so-long">Why has it taken so long?</h4>

<p>It took longer than expected. This is a highly complex PFI contract and we had to ensure that the contractual details for were absolutely right for a contract lasting 35 years.</p>

<h4 id="can-this-project-adapt-to-further-in-the-requirement">Can this project adapt to further in the requirement?</h4>

<p>Yes. The accommodation design is flexible enough to accommodate changes. However, where this is not possible a change mechanism to meet new requirements in a timely and value for money fashion is in place.</p>

<h4 id="why-was-project-allenbyconnaught-set-up">Why was Project Allenby/Connaught set up?</h4>

<p>More Army units, along with their associated personnel and equipment, needed to use and/or be accommodated in the garrisons adjacent to the Salisbury Plain Training Area and within Aldershot Garrison. A reorganisation of force structures also resulted in some unit moves. A Project Team, Allenby/Connaught, was established to examine the best way of meeting these requirements. The ultimate aim was to improve the living and working environment of all personnel, whilst achieving long term value for money and it is flexible enough to take into account any new additional initiatives.</p>

<h4 id="why-did-the-mod-decide-to-run-a-pfi-competition">Why did the MOD decide to run a PFI competition?</h4>

<p>Project Allenby/Connaught undertook a detailed study into the Army’s accommodation requirements. This included reviewing opportunities for rationalising the Army estate and increasing efficiency in the provision of associated support services. The study found that a considerable amount of investment is required to meet these requirements and, it was decided to explore the potential for private sector investment through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI).</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-pfi">What is a PFI?</h4>

<p>A Private Finance Initiative project is one in which the private sector partner invest in assets and facilities from which it then provides services over the long term to the public sector. In the case of Allenby/Connaught the private sector will provide serviced accommodation and other support services. PFIs are widely used both within the MoD and across the wider public sector. MoD has PFIs for housing, simulators, vehicles, office accommodation and training establishments. Other sectors use PFI for roads, schools, hospitals, rail and office accommodation.</p>

<p>A Private Finance Initiative is a mechanism where a contractor borrows money against a future income stream and uses the borrowings to fund the construction phase. The risk of delivering the new facilities and the services over the long term period passes to the contractor.</p>

<h4 id="how-was-the-project-advertised">How was the Project advertised?</h4>

<p>The Project sought Expressions of Interest from industry through an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Community (OJEC). Details were also published in MoD Contract Bulletins, Government Opportunities, Works Services Opportunities and relevant trade press and journals.</p>

<h4 id="what-was-the-outcome-of-the-advertisement">What was the outcome of the advertisement?</h4>

<p>A number of responses were received as a result of OJEC advertisement. Following a Pre-Qualification exercise three bidders were issued with an Invitation to Negotiate. One bidder withdrew in October 2002 leaving two remaining bidders in the competition, Abraxis and Aspire Defence Limited. An evaluation of these bids and internal approvals procedures concluded when Aspire Defence Limited were appointed as the Preferred Bidder.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-aspire-defence-limited">Who is Aspire Defence Limited?</h4>

<p>Aspire Defence Limited has been established specifically for the project and brings together Carillion and Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR) in a consortium committed to Allenby/Connaught.</p>

<h3 id="construction-and-service-delivery">Construction and Service Delivery</h3>

<h4 id="what-will-happen-at-the-start-of-the-contract">What will happen at the start of the contract?</h4>

<p>During the first eight years of the contract there will be a significant capital works programme (new buildings/demolition/refurbishment). This started in the areas of greatest need (Aldershot, Perham Down and Tidworth) and will involve the construction of new buildings that would cover an area twice the size of Hyde Park.</p>

<p>Three months after contract award Aspire started to provide an extensive range of support services, these will be provided over the 35 year term of the contract.</p>

<h4 id="what-accommodation-will-the-project-provide">What accommodation will the Project provide?</h4>

<p>The Project will provide modern living and working accommodation, for some 18,700 military personnel in the Salisbury Plain and Aldershot garrisons. This includes the provision of some 11,500 single room en-suite bed spaces for service personnel, messes, cookhouses, junior ranks clubs, and storage.</p>

<h4 id="how-many-buildings-will-be-demolished">How many buildings will be demolished?</h4>

<p>Based on current plans in excess of 450 buildings will be demolished across the project footprint.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-so-many-being-demolished-does-this-make-financial-sense-surely-they-are-not-all-beyond-economic-repair-and-could-be-used-for-something-else">Why are so many being demolished? Does this make financial sense? Surely they are not all beyond economic repair and could be used for something else?</h4>

<p>Many of the sites within the projects footprint have been in use since the early 1900’s and much of the built estate dates back to that time. Although there have been some new buildings on these sites, much of the accommodation is beyond its economic life, and is also unfit for today’s need, eg, shared rooms instead of single rooms.</p>

<p>Aspire has compiled a detailed programme of construction and where necessary demolition, in order to meet the Army’s requirements. Buildings for which future use remains unclear will be made “wind and weather proof” in order to reserve our position and reduce costs.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-you-building-so-much-new-accommodation">Why are you building so much new accommodation?</h4>

<p>In many instances new construction is the only way of meeting the requirement, to the appropriate standard.</p>

<p>How could you let your servicemen and women live under such poor conditions for so long?</p>

<p>It is acknowledged that some accommodation is unsuitable for housing soldiers. A number of projects have been undertaken, eg, Project SLAM, to alleviate this problem, and Project Allenby/Connaught is a further example.</p>

<h4 id="what-sites-are-affected-by-the-project">What sites are affected by the Project?</h4>

<h4 id="what-services-will-be-provided-by-aspire">What services will be provided by Aspire?</h4>

<p>Aspire will provide a wide range of services including the management of nearly 1,000 green and white fleet vehicles, the management of garrison stores facilities, catering (some 430 military catering staff will assist them), domestic services, utilities and waste management.</p>

<h4 id="is-this-a-further-example-of-the-governments-reluctance-to-invest-in-areas-other-than-the-south--south-east">Is this a further example of the government’s reluctance to invest in areas other than the South &amp; South East?</h4>

<p>The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) identified a requirement for more Army units, along with their associated personnel and equipment, to use and/or be accommodated in the garrisons adjacent to the Salisbury Plain Training Area and within Aldershot Garrison. This project is key to successful delivery of this requirement.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence is investing in the Army Estate across the UK and is not concentrating on the south and south east. Moreover, we are acting in accordance with Lyons principles in terms of overall MOD numbers in the South East.</p>

<h4 id="will-this-project-only-provide-opportunities-for-companies-in-the-south-of-england">Will this project only provide opportunities for companies in the south of England?</h4>

<p>Project Allenby/Connaught will provide substantial benefits to the wider UK economy through the use of many sub-contractors involved in off-site construction. For example has guaranteed a large number of jobs at the Corus factory in Shotton, North Wales.</p>

<h3 id="personnel-issues">Personnel Issues</h3>

<h4 id="what-impact-was-there-on-mod-staff">What impact was there on MoD staff?</h4>

<p>Approximately 380 MoD Civil Service posts were transferred to the Aspire Defence Limited consortium under TUPE rules. TUPE legislation protects the terms and conditions of transferring employees. Occupational pensions are outside the scope of TUPE legislation however the MoD requires that when it’s staff transfer to a private company they are offered a pension scheme by their new employer that is broadly comparable to their existing civil service scheme.</p>

<h4 id="did-this-result-in-any-redundancies">Did this result in any redundancies?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4 id="what-support-services-are-affected-by-the-project">What support services are affected by the Project?</h4>

<p>The Project encompasses a wide range of support services including domestic services, estate management, document production and handling, stores, transport and waste disposal. Some of these services are currently provided within the public sector, whilst others are already provided through existing contracts.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-those-who-were-employed-under-existing-contracts">What about those who were employed under existing contracts?</h4>

<p>The 1800 personnel employed through existing contracts transferred to the Aspire Defence supply chain.</p>

<h4 id="will-the-pfi-create-any-additional-employment-opportunities">Will the PFI create any additional employment opportunities?</h4>

<p>It is likely that opportunities will be created, particularly on the construction phase of the project. The urban regeneration programme planned in Aldershot will also create significant employment opportunities.</p>

<h4 id="how-many">How many?</h4>

<p>It is difficult, to quantify this.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-urban-re-generation-programme-in-aldershot">What is the urban re-generation programme in Aldershot?</h4>

<p>As a result of plans proposed by Aspire Defence, Project Allenby/Connaught will enable the release of a large area of land south of the Basingstoke Canal. Defence Estates, in conjunction with Rushmoor Borough Council, have developed a solution that will facilitate the redevelopment of the area. There are plans to provide a range of housing solutions including affordable homes for key workers in the area.</p>

<h4 id="will-the-setting-up-of-a-mod-pfi-review-body-affect-the-signing-of-this-contract">Will the setting up of a MoD PFI review body affect the signing of this contract?</h4>

<p>No. The Public Finance Unit will ensure that the MoD receives the best value for money and that best practice/lesson learnt form previous PFIs are shared with the Allenby/Connaught Project Team. Likewise, Project Allenby/Connaught will share lessons learnt for the benefit of future PFI’s.</p>

<h4 id="does-the-project-cover-family-quarters">Does the Project cover family quarters?</h4>

<p>The Project does not encompass family quarters.</p>

<h4 id="have-the-public-been-consulted">Have the public been consulted?</h4>

<p>Each of the garrisons affected by the project remains closely engaged with the local community. The normal processes for informing the public on planning proposals have been followed.</p>

<h4 id="what-impact-will-the-project-have-on-the-local-communities-how-will-it-benefit-them">What impact will the Project have on the local communities? How will it benefit them?</h4>

<p>Community interests have been considered and regular liaison with Local Authorities and community groups has taken place. It is envisaged that a particular benefit to arise from the Project will be the opportunities for closer integration between military and civilian communities. This could occur for example in areas such as further shared use of leisure, recreational and community centre facilities.</p>

<h4 id="what-community-facilities-are-proposed">What community facilities are proposed?</h4>

<p>New theatres and family centres, and additional, complementary sports facilities will be provided. For example new community centres at Larkhill and Warminster, and a new theatre at Tidworth, all of which will be available to the local residents as well as Army personnel and families.</p>

<h4 id="have-all-local-councils-and-authorities-been-fully-consulted-how-have-they-been-involved">Have all local councils and authorities been fully consulted? How have they been involved?</h4>

<p>The scale of the proposed developments means that close co-ordination with Regional Government Offices, County and District Councils as well as Statutory Bodies and Non-Governmental Organisations has been essential. The Local Authorities have been consulted on traffic, schooling and primary health care. Planning authorities have been engaged at all stages, and their agreement to proceed has been essential.</p>

<h4 id="what-consideration-has-been-given-to-environmental-issues">What consideration has been given to environmental issues?</h4>

<p>Full external scrutiny of the project has been undertaken, and the new and refurbished buildings will be BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) compliant. All new builds are required to achieve a BREEAM ‘Excellent’ rating and any refurbishment must achieve a BREEAM ‘Very Good’ rating. Also, as part of their contractual obligations, Aspire are required to implement key environmental efficiencies such as rainwater harvesting, solar thermal and combined heat and power solutions.</p>

<p>The Project Team and Aspire are working very closely with County and District Councils, the Environment Agency, English Heritage, English Nature and others to ensure that environmental and sustainability issues are taken into account. The assessment of potential environmental impacts has progressed jointly with Local Authorities and Statutory Bodies, and various reports have been submitted as part of the consultation process.</p>

<p>In addition, separate studies have been commissioned for Aldershot and Salisbury Plain Training Areas and have been used to support the Project’s proposals. The Project will adhere to Sustainable Development principles and Environmental Management Systems. Aspire Defence has undertaken a full Environmental Impact Assessment to support their detailed plans.</p>

<h4 id="will-the-new-constructions-be-energy-efficient">Will the new constructions be energy efficient?</h4>

<p>Yes. Buildings will have solar panels, rainwater harvesting and metering. Buildings will be regularly monitored to ensure that energy efficiencies are maximised. Buildings will also conform to the latest standards for insulation.</p>

<h4 id="what-will-happen-to-listed-buildings-and-monuments-or-those-designated-as-being-of-historic-importance">What will happen to listed buildings and monuments, or those designated as being of historic importance?</h4>

<p>Any renovation or refurbishment will take full account of relevant regulations.</p>

<h4 id="are-there-any-plans-to-demolish-any-of-these-buildings">Are there any plans to demolish any of these buildings?</h4>

<p>No. Retention of listed buildings has been the subject of negotiation with the planning authorities.</p>

<h4 id="what-will-happen-to-the-land-no-longer-required-by-the-army">What will happen to the land no longer required by the Army?</h4>

<p>This will be handed to MOD Defence Estates, who will manage its future use including, where appropriate, disposal..</p>

<h4 id="will-any-land-be-sold">Will any land be sold?</h4>

<p>Yes, there are plans to alienate areas particularly in Aldershot, where some 160 hectares will be disposed of. This will be managed by Defence Estates. The MoD and Rushmoor Borough Council are working closely together on developing an overall plan for the redevelopment of Aldershot, which will include the provision of affordable housing.</p>

<h4 id="how-much-revenue-do-you-expect-to-realise-from-this-disposal">How much revenue do you expect to realise from this disposal?</h4>

<p>This information is commercial-in-confidence. Negotiations are ongoing regarding the disposal of surplus land.</p>

<h4 id="will-aldershot-remain-home-to-the-british-army">Will Aldershot remain home to the British Army?</h4>

<p>Yes. There is a commitment by the Army to Aldershot which can be demonstrated by the early construction programme included in the Project.</p>

<h4 id="are-salisbury-plain-and-aldershot-going-to-be-made-into-super-garrisons">Are Salisbury Plain and Aldershot going to be made into “Super Garrisons”?</h4>

<p>The Strategy for the Army Estate contains a concept of “super garrisons” of which Salisbury Plain and Aldershot are two.</p>

<h2 id="garrisons-within-the-project-1">Garrisons within the project</h2>

<p>Sustainability issues never stand still and the project will not rest on its laurels.  <abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr> will embrace new and useful initiatives and techniques as they emerge.</p>

<p>BIOMASS option - self-generating energy solutions which include the use of rapeseed oil and wood chippings to provide heating/water on an industrial scale are actively considered.  </p>

<p>Using BIOMASS as a fuel offers a number of advantages: it is a carbon neutral process and can offer potential economic advantages when a local fuel supply is used.  </p>

<p>Project Allenby/Connaught is participating in field trials for Project Charcoal.  The project is being carried out by the Universities of Surry and Sheffield with the forestry commission and has a funding of £500,000.  </p>

<p>Project Charcoal is the research into the effect of the introduction of charcoal treated with selected micro-organisms to contaminated soil.  Charcoal treatments have been shown to provide exceptional results in terms of controlling or eliminating pollutants.  Whilst at the same time using renewable, sustainable materials and standard construction techniques.  </p>

<p>It is hoped that this technology, once proven, could bring widespread benefits to the wider UK redevelopment industry.</p>

<h2 id="modular-construction">Modular construction</h2>

<h3 id="accommodation-blocks-using-modular-construction">Accommodation blocks using modular construction</h3>

<p>In excess of 350 new buildings will be erected during the Project’s 8 year construction programme, a large number of which will be provided through off-site modular construction. </p>

<p>The various bedrooms (with en-suite shower rooms), lounge, utility room, storage area, corridor and bathroom modules are constructed under factory conditions.  These are made to a virtually complete standard and then transported to site for assembly into a completed building. </p>

<p>This method offers a higher and more consistent quality control and a more cost effective solution than traditional on-site methods. It also presents other benefits from a sustainability standpoint.</p>

<ul>
<li>shorter build time – factory construction of a module takes about a week.  The assembly of the modules on site into a 36 man, six man flat, accommodation block takes a further five days.  The brickwork outer skin and roofing taking just over four weeks.  This is a saving on overheads, cost of capital and provides the facility for use earlier</li>
  <li>low carbon footprint - less energy is required to produce the modules given the economies of scale associated with the manufacturing facility</li>
  <li>the risk of weather damage to components is reduced by pre-fabrication off site thus minimising unnecessary wastage</li>
  <li>the ability to stockpile modules within the factory to protect critical timelines on the construction programme</li>
  <li>Health &amp; Safety performance is improved as most of the works are completed in a controlled factory setting  </li>
</ul>
<p>This sustainable approach is entirely consistent with ensuring rapid progress on a project the scale of <abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="project-allenbyconnaught-project-summary">Project Allenby/Connaught: project summary</h2>

<p>Project Allenby/Connaught has one simple mission – to make life better for some 18,700 soldiers (nearly 20% of the British Army) by providing modern, high quality, fully serviced, purpose-built living and working accommodation. The contract was awarded to Aspire Defence Limited, a joint venture between Carillion and KBR, in April 2006.</p>

<p>In addition to a major £1.45Bn 8-year construction programme involving the new build or refurbishment of 562 buildings and the demolition of 496, the 35 year project encompasses a wide range of support services including catering, cleaning, transport, estate management, document production and handling, stores and waste disposal. The Project has a total through life value of some £8Bn and covers Army Garrisons across Salisbury Plain and at Aldershot.</p>

<p>On average, one new building is delivered to the Army each week. Buildings include offices, stores, training facilities, dining centres, sports and leisure facilities, but the core is 261 accommodation units and in all the project will deliver or maintain 11,500 single en-suite bedspaces for single soldiers.
This is not just a “quick fix”. Buildings will not be allowed to degenerate and they will be maintained throughout the life of the contract.</p>

<p>A key feature of the contract is the help desk physically located at each of the garrisons. The help desk provides a telephone, walk in and email point of contact for advice and assistance on all of the services that Aspire are responsible for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The helpdesks receive an average of 5,600 calls per month of which in excess of 98% are answered within 30 seconds.</p>

<ul>
<li>in the first six years since the project began over 9,000 bedspaces have been delivered</li>
  <li>466 new and refurbished buildings constructed and 423 demolitions completed with 97% re-use of material</li>
  <li>over 2m meals served annually</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="allenbyconnaught-scoops-3-awards">Allenby/Connaught scoops 3 awards</h3>

<p>Poject Allenby/Connaught scooped three major awards at the Public Private Finance Awards ceremony held last night in London. The three awards presented to Project Allenby/Connaught are: Best Operational Defence Scheme, Best Government/Government Agency Team award and the Grand Prix award for the ‘Best Operational UK Project’. The awards which are now in their tenth year are sponsored by Public Private Finance Journal, and recognise innovation and excellence in the public private partnerships industry.</p>

<p>The awards also recognise leading organisations which offer services as well as buildings applaud those which strive for innovation and efficiencies.</p>

<p>Aspire Defence have been contracted by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to deliver high quality modern and sustainable living and working accommodation for 18,700 soldiers who are based in Aldershot and in Garrisons around the Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>The awards also recognise leading organisations which offer services as well as buildings applaud those which strive for innovation and efficiencies.</p>

<p>Aspire Defence have been contracted by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to deliver high quality modern and sustainable living and working accommodation for 18,700 soldiers who are based in Aldershot and in Garrisons around the Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>Progress to date has been nothing short of excellent and just two years into the contract Aspire Defence and the MoD have already achieved outstanding results:</p>

<ul>
<li>a full range of much improved services commenced within 90 days of contract signature and are making a real difference to the quality of life for the soldiers we support.</li>
  <li>we have already handed over more than 100 new or refurbished buildings and continue to do so ahead of programme, at an average rate of one a week.</li>
  <li>nearly 2,000 soldiers have moved into their new single en-suite rooms.</li>
  <li>we have shown flexibility by handling well over 200 significant changes since contract close with local requirements flexed on an almost daily basis.</li>
  <li>all of this has been handled in a genuine and committed partnering relationship which is held up as a model for other projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence of all this, soldiers returning from demanding operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are now increasingly moving into new accommodation of a standard which they deserve and of which the nation can be proud.</p>

<p>“To win these awards is a fantastic accolade. To win the Best Government Team award recognises the efforts my team have put into this project. They are all totally committed to delivering what we have promised and Allenby/Connaught really is making soldiers lives better, and I am delighted to receive this award on their behalf. To also win the Grand Prix award and the award for the Best Operational Defence Scheme is a further endorsement of the progress we have made to improve the living and working accommodation for the British Army. This is a complex project covering a huge area, which has the opportunity to improve the daily lives of more than 18,700 soldiers. Proof that we are delivering on this commitment can be seen around the garrisons, and I am proud that this has been recognised by winning these prestigious awards”. said Doug Weidner, MoD Project Manager.</p>

<h2 id="project-history">Project history</h2>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-project-allenbyconnaught">A brief history of Project Allenby/Connaught</h3>

<h4 id="historical-background">Historical background</h4>

<p>The War Office first purchased land on Salisbury Plain in 1897 primarily for Army manoeuvres. The main acquisition programme was completed in 1902. Work started on building Tidworth Garrison later that year with full occupation of the eight barrack areas being achieved by 1910. The other major Salisbury Plain garrisons followed over the next 30 years or so.</p>

<p>Aldershot Garrison, often described as the “Home of the British Army” is one of the larger garrisons occupied by the Services with about 4700 troops. It is host to several formation headquarters, including HQ 4 Division, and a number of logistic and mechanised infantry units. It also serves as the Army’s Centre of Sporting Excellence. The garrison is bordered by the towns of Aldershot and Farnborough, the Army Training Estate (ATE), and the Blackwater Valley Road. </p>

<p>The site has traditionally divided into North Camp, north of the Basingstoke Canal, and South Camp. The garrison is around 500 hectares in size and relatively open, with numerous sports pitches and other green areas. The area includes a number of individual barracks and other facilities and enclaves of Family Quarters (FQs), which are leased from Annington Homes. The area represents 28% of the land in Rushmoor Borough Council.</p>

<p>The building stock ranged from listed buildings to Poulson “system buildings”, and included three new barracks completed since 1995, the most recent being New Mons. </p>

<p>Aldershot Garrison is unusual in that it owns a considerable proportion of its utilities and roads. These include an electrical network, tied into the partially operated Aldershot Military Power Station (AMPS), a District Heating System (DHS) covering South Camp, a water catchment area with treatment facilities, and its own sewage network and treatment plant.</p>

<h3 id="mod-policy-on-private-finance-initiative">MOD Policy on Private Finance Initiative</h3>

<p>In order to impliment a number of changes to the organisation and location of many elements of the Army across Salisbury Plain and Aldershot, a PFI had to be examined as a potential procurement strategy. As a result of this requirement Land Command established two projects, ALLENBY for Salisbury Plain and CONNAUGHT for Aldershot, to undertake a Scoping Study for each area to identify the potential for a Public Private Partnership (PPP) solution.</p>

<h3 id="scoping-study-phase">Scoping study phase</h3>

<p>The ALLENBY and CONNAUGHT Scoping Studies were started in late summer 1999. They concluded in February and April 2000 respectively. Both Studies found that there was sufficient potential for PPP to justify undertaking a more detailed Feasibility Study. TU consultation was undertaken on the outcome of the Scoping Study and the Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the Feasibility Study(s) and no comments were received.</p>

<h3 id="project-management">Project management</h3>

<p>During the early stages of the feasibility work Land Command recognised the significant potential synergies between ALLENBY and CONNAUGHT and so in July 2000 it was decided to combine the management of the two Projects. In addition to these synergies, discussions with the approving authorities indicated that the two Projects would not be considered in isolation. Work on the procurement options also highlighted the potential for combining the two Projects into a single procurement activity. Hence it was decided to combine the reporting of the two Projects into a single coherent document, albeit with the location specific issues fully documented; subsequently a decision was taken to formally merge the two teams.</p>

<h3 id="invitation-to-negotiate">Invitation to negotiate</h3>

<p>An Invitation to Negotiate was issued to three Bidders on 31 July 2002, Abraxis; Aspire Defence Limited and Defence Accommodation Services Limited (DASL), however, DASL subsequently withdrew from the competition in October 2002.</p>

<p>On 11 December 2002 both consortia submitted their bids which were then subjected to rigorous evaluation and comparison to the Departments own Public Sector Comparator (PSC). As a result of this demanding process Aspire Defence Limited were selected as the Provisional Preferred Bidder for Allenby/Connaught.</p>

<h3 id="main-gate-approval">Main gate approval</h3>

<p>In August 2004 the Investment Approvals Board and MOD Ministers considered the Main Gate Business Case submitted for the Project and approved, subject to final contract negotiations, Project Allenby/Connaught proceeding to contract with Aspire Defence Limited. On the basis of this approval the status of Aspire Defence Limited moved from Provisional Preferred Bidder to that of Preferred Bidder.</p>

<h3 id="contract-award">Contract award</h3>

<p>Once Aspire Defence Limited had been appointed as the Preferred Bidder both parties undertook some very detailed planning. This is a highly complex PFI contract and care had to be taken to ensure that the contractual details for the largest estates PFI of this type for the Army were absolutely right for a contract lasting 35 years. This was time very well spent as a smooth transition, a key project objective, was achieved and one that had to be delivered. The need for the garrisons to remain operationally effective at all times is absolutely essential. This is particularly relevant at the present time given the Army’s current operational commitments around the world.</p>

<h2 id="sustainablility-and-design">Sustainablility and design</h2>

<h3 id="sustainable-building">Sustainable Building</h3>

<p>Sustainability has been taken fully into account in the design of the new and refurbished buildings being provided.</p>

<p>The Project Agreement requires all new buildings to achieve an ‘Excellent’ rating in the bespoke BREEAM and EcoHomes standards.  Refurbished buildings must achieve a ‘Very Good’ rating.</p>

<p>As a result, all new and refurbished buildings will achieve one of these BREEAM certificates making <abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr> the largest concentration of such certification in the UK.</p>

<p>This adherence to BREEAM certification is not simply an aspiration. A demonstrator block, constructed to prove the design in 2005, was subjected to the same stringent sustainability requirements demanded by the contract.  The building gained a BREEAM Excellent rating. </p>

<p>The sustainable development and energy management measures that are built into the contract are comprehensive and seek to deliver long term improvements in ‘quality of life’ on the estate.</p>

<p>Sustainability principles are observed in the siting of new buildings in order both to minimise the impact to the surrounding areas and local wildlife.  They also encourage the use of alternative means of transport to the car. </p>

<p>More efficient land use in the project allows more troops to be accommodated across the project footprint but still releases 160 hectares for disposal.</p>

<p>A suite of sustainable design measures are being installed including Combined Heat and Power plants. </p>

<p>Extensive harvesting systems are used to collect and re-use rainwater.</p>

<p>17,500 cubic metres of water is collected, harvesting enough rainwater to fill 10 Olympic sized swimming pools each year.  Or the equivalent of approximately 4,000,000 toilet flushes a year. </p>

<p>Solar thermal panels are used to provide hot water</p>

<h2 id="the-approach-to-environment-and-sustainability">The approach to environment and sustainability</h2>

<p><abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr> made sustainability a key requirement in its negotiations prior to contract award. Aspire has embraced this requirement. As a result a large part of the MOD estate, accommodating 20% of the British Army, is to be built, maintained and serviced to very high sustainability standards.</p>

<p>Many of the Allenby/Connaught sites are located adjacent to designated ecologically-sensitive areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty or within regions of archaeological significance, such as the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. Therefore sustainability was a key criterion during tender evaluation and throughout negotiations and is now embedded in the heart of the project.</p>

<p>The project has received an independent endorsement of its approach to sustainability, winning two awards at the 2007 Building Magazine Sustainability Awards – overall winner of the Sustainable Development of the Year and Best Sustainability Initiative for the Public Sector. These awards recognised the projects outstanding sustainability achievement and environmental excellence. Further awards included the 2008 Contract Journal Award for Environmental Leadership.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Sustainability is at the heart of what is important to the supplier, Aspire Defence Ltd, and the customer, the MOD, over the duration of this 35 year contract. It is tempting to think that at the end of this period sustainability will not rate such special consideration because <abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr> and other major estate development projects will have made the issue an accepted part of daily business. </p>

<h2 id="tidworth-celebrates-the-100th-building-accepted-into-service">Tidworth celebrates the 100th building accepted into service</h2>

<p>The newly refurbished Assaye Officers’ Mess for 1 Royal Horse Artillery (1 RHA) became the 100th building to be completed in Tidworth by Project Allenby/Connaught, thus making the Edwardian living accommodation fit for the 21st Century and bringing the total up to 161 buildings delivered across the whole of the Project.</p>

<p>The building was delivered by Aspire Defence Capital Works and Aspire Defence Services Ltd under Project Allenby/Connaught – the 35 year contract through which Aspire Defence, a joint venture between KBR and Carillion, is replacing and improving Army living and working accommodation across the garrisons of Salisbury Plain and Aldershot.The Mess, which includes a lodge and annex, can accommodate up to 51 officers, and the refurbished building provides modern dining and living facilities with en-suite accommodation which has been converted from single rooms with communal facilities. </p>

<p>To preserve the architectural heritage of the 1 RHA Officers’ Mess, the original facade and entrance to the building have been retained, along with the formal sweeping driveway to the pillared main entrance. </p>

<p>The Commanding Officer of 1 Royal Horse Artillery, Lieutenant Colonel Simon Humphrey said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The completion of Assaye Mess is a milestone for both 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and Aspire Defence, and how appropriate that the 100th building on Tidworth Garrison goes to the 1st Regiment! Its re-occupation will mark the near completion of a completely redeveloped barracks providing much improved infrastructure and facilities. Most importantly the re-development of Assaye Barracks has given my soldiers a quality of life they have deserved for many, many years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doug Weidner, Project Manager for the MoD’s Project Allenby/Connaught said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is another significant milestone for the Project and is further evidence of the outstanding progress we have made here in Tidworth just 2½ half years into the contract. The work here, and indeed at other garrisons in the Project’s footprint, has transformed the lives of the soldiers who live and work on the garrison. It is also testament to the effectiveness of the working relationship we have with our contractor, Aspire Defence, who has been set some very challenging deadlines for the delivery of new and refurbished buildings and, I am pleased to say, they have proved up to the mark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter Smart, Chief Executive of Aspire Defence Limited said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are delighted to hand over to the CO 1 RHA, this, our 100th building at Tidworth. In refurbishing this mess we have brought it up to modern standards, with single en-suite rooms but have also preserved the very distinct and important character of the building. Perhaps more important than 100 buildings, 30 months into the contract we already have over 2,500 hard working soldiers living in new accommodation across the Project – we really are making their lives better and with the delivery of another building every week we look forward to extending that to many more soldiers over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-aspire-defence">Who are Aspire Defence?</h2>

<h3 id="information-on-project-allenbyconnaughts-contractor">Information on Project Allenby/Connaught’s contractor.</h3>

<p>Aspire Defence Limited is a Special Purpose Vehicle set up specifically to deliver Project Allenby/Connaught with the aim of making life better for soldiers across the four garrisons it serves.  As a Private Finance Initiative, funds have been raised through a combination of bond funding and equity to complete the construction phase of the Project.  The equity is provided by four shareholders Carillion, KBR, Innisfree and HSBC.</p>

<p>Aspire Defence Limited holds a 35 year contract with the MOD to complete a construction programme involving some 500 new or refurbished buildings and the delivery of a broad range of services across the garrisons from construction to catering, stores management, transport, building maintenance, ground maintenance and cleaning - to name just a few.  In order to do this it places the construction work with Aspire Defence Capital Works and the service delivery with Aspire Defence Services Limited.</p>

<p>Aspire Defence Capital Works, a joint venture between Carillion and KBR, is delivering a range of working and living accommodation that stretches from dining and mess facilities to office and technical buildings.</p>

<p>Aspire Defence Services Limited (ADSL), also a joint venture between Carillion and KBR, is responsible for managing the existing and new estates.  Teams are based at each location providing accommodation and support services for the Army garrisons.  Such is the size and scope of the contract that in order to deliver the services required ADSL works with a number of key partners and a small number of support contractors.</p>

<h3 id="homes-for-bats-and-a-new-home-found-for-lizards">Homes for bats and a new home found for lizards</h3>

<p>Not all inhabitants of existing buildings under <abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr> wear uniforms.  </p>

<p>Every building to be demolished will be fully assessed for bats and nesting birds by licensed surveyors.  A number of bat species have been encountered to date, including brown long-eared and common pipistrelle.  In order to compensate for the loss of roosting areas, the Single Living Accommodation blocks are fitted with a range of bat mitigation features.  These include bat bricks, bat cavity spaces, squeeze boxes and partitioned loft spaces. </p>

<p>This range of design measures is intended to offer the various species of bats a variety of habitats to encourage them to roost within the buildings and so preserve their continued presence in the area.  Allenby/Connaught is one of the largest bat mitigation schemes ever undertaken.  </p>

<p>At the Perham Down site, before construction began reptiles, slow worms and common lizards were found.  </p>

<p>Aspire Defence embarked upon a lengthy programme of relocation.</p>

<p>Using specialist reptile relocation techniques around 1000 animals were successfully moved to an approved receptor site in advance of the ground works commencing.</p>

<h3 id="working-together">Working Together</h3>

<p>Sustainability has been at the heart of the project since the outset.  A cooperative approach with interested external organisations will continue for the duration of the project.  A collaborative project was undertaken during 2007 with Natural England, Defence Estates and Kennet District Council.  This was to compensate for the unavoidable loss of calcareous grassland (a highly valuable bio diverse habitat) in the Perham Down area as a result of the <abbr title="Project Allenby/Connaught">PAC</abbr> build programme.  </p>

<p>Salisbury Plain is the largest calcareous grassland area in Europe, and the project compensates for the loss of such grassland by providing new areas off site to ensure this valuable resource is protected. </p>
