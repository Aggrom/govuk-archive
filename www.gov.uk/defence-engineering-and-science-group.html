<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The UK needs modern, battle-winning forces to defend the UK’s interests and to contribute to strengthening international peace and security.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> civil service exists to enable, equip and support the three armed services in the delivery of defence capability. As a part of this, the Defence Engineering and Science Group (<abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr>) is a community of 13,000 professional engineers and scientists working within <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> civil service to equip and support the UK Armed Forces with state-of-the-art technology. We are the force behind the forces. </p>

<h2 id="desg-graduate-scheme">
<abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme</h2>

<p>This scheme is probably the very best graduate development scheme for engineers and scientists in the UK. It could prepare you for a career that meets your aspirations, if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>possess strong problem-solving skills and enjoy the thought of working at the cutting edge of technology  </li>
  <li>have the potential to lead people and work effectively in teams  </li>
  <li>have genuine interest in developing yourself to your full personal and professional potential</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme recruits and develops graduate engineers and scientists. There are also opportunities for students, sixth formers and those about to enter sixth form.</p>

<p>Getting an education in engineering and science can be expensive and deciding on a career path at the end can be confusing without prior experience. Our sixth form and undergraduate student opportunities offer financial help, personal development opportunities and the experience you need to make decisions about your future.</p>

<p>Assuming no previous working experience, we will invest heavily in you. Over and above your salary, there will be considerable investment in your professional development. We aim to take you through to chartered status in your profession within just 4 years of starting the scheme.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-scheme-works">How the scheme works</h3>

<p>The prestigious <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme has been an industry leader for almost 30 years, launching hundreds of graduates into satisfying careers in engineering or science. The scheme is accredited by a number of professional institutions including IMeche, IET, RINA, IoP, IMarEST and RAeS.</p>

<p>The scheme is tailored to individual development needs to ensure that you have the best possible preparation for your first professional post and your subsequent career in <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Civil Service. The scheme will last for a maximum of 2 years (reduced for graduates with previous experience) and includes a range of in-house work placements, industry secondments and formal training courses. There is no age limit for entry to the graduate scheme, but, it is designed for those with little or no work experience in engineering and science and may not benefit those with significant previous experience.</p>

<p>Most graduates are based in Bristol, Bath, London, Waddington, Clyde or Plymouth. Work placements during the graduate scheme, however, can be located anywhere in the UK or overseas. At the end of the graduate scheme, most graduates take up permanent appointments in the above areas.</p>

<p>On entry to the scheme, you will be assigned to a Specialist Stream or Engineering System Anchor, taking into account your degree discipline and preferences wherever possible.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/engineering-system-anchors">Engineering System Anchors document</a> for more details and a guide to the ESAs that you can work in with a given degree - other choices may be possible. Contact us for further advice.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about the scheme, please see the Grad Fact Sheet in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mod-desg-graduate-trainee"><abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="accreditations">Accreditations</h3>

<p>Chartered engineers and scientists are an important asset to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and as a result the scheme has developed in accordance with the needs of many professional institutions. This has allowed for formal development plans to be applied to the scheme with the aim of our graduates achieving Charted status.</p>

<h2 id="how-desg-works">How <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> works</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is made up of a number of organisations, agencies and trading funds. The <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme recruits on behalf of Defence Equipment and Support (<abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr>), the organisation that equips and supports the UK’s armed forces for current and future operations. It acquires and supports through-life, including disposal, equipment and services ranging from ships, aircraft, vehicles and weapons, to electronic systems and information services.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> also satisfies ongoing requirements including food, clothing, medical supplies, maintenance and temporary accommodation, as well as operating HM naval bases and joint supply chain for land, sea and air.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> works closely with industry through partnering agreements and private finance initiatives in accordance with the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) to deliver effective solutions for defence.</p>

<p>Formed from the merger of the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO), with headquarters in Bristol, <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> has around 29,000 people based at sites across the UK and abroad. It has an annual spend of £16 billion representing 43 percent of the Defence Budget.</p>

<h2 id="desg-technology">
<abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Technology</h2>

<p>Our Armed Forces increasingly depend on scientific and technological advances to maintain their ability to operate effectively. They need equipment and capabilities that give a technological edge over any potential opponent and keep the UK compatible with our Allies.</p>

<p>Countering new types of threats as they emerge will be a key challenge to UK forces in the future. We therefore place a premium on the ability to generate and identify innovative technologies, adopt them for military use and integrate them rapidly into platforms, weapon systems and force structures.</p>

<h3 id="taranis-a-bond-worthy-automaton">Taranis: a Bond-worthy automaton</h3>

<p>An example of this is Taranis, of which the Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taranis…is something that would not be out of place in the latest James Bond film - a pilotless combat aircraft for the British Armed Forces that will be capable of delivering weapons to a battlefield in another continent with almost no need for operator input. It does not come much more exciting than that!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bloodhound-a-record-breaking-project">Bloodhound, a record-breaking project</h3>

<p>Just one more example of work that <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> graduates are a part of is the Bloodhound, supersonic car project. <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> graduates have helped to overcome many technical challenges over the years and the quest for a car that will exceed 1,000 mph is no exception.</p>

<p>Ever wondered how most equipment gets to the front line fast? It’s not by boat, nor land, and it’s most definitely not just a simple question of putting it on a sling. The Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit (JADTEU) is an example of a team where <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> graduates can work. Working on tight time schedules, graduates have been helping solve complex engineering problems ranging from how to parachute someone safely from never attempted heights, speeds or places, to how to transport the latest tanks to the field, and how many we can carry safely.</p>
