<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The MOD Civil Service exists to enable, equip and support the three armed services in the delivery of defence capability. As a part of this, the Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group (<abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr>) is a community of 13,000 professional engineers and scientists working within MoD Civil Service to equip and support the UK Armed Forces with state of the art technology. We are truly the force behind the forces. </p>

<p>The UK needs modern, battle-winning forces to defend the UK interests and to contribute to strengthening international peace and security.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you possess strong problem-solving skills? Do you enjoy the thought of working at the cutting edge of technology?</li>
  <li>Do you have the potential to lead people and work effectively in teams?</li>
  <li>Do you have genuine interest in developing yourself to your full personal and professional potential?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel positively about these questions then our development schemes could prepare you for a career that will meet your aspirations. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme recruits and develops graduate engineers and scientists. This scheme is probably the very best graduate development scheme for engineers and scientists available in the UK.</p>

<p>There are also opportunities for students, sixth-formers and even when you are about to enter the sixth form! Acquiring an education in engineering and science can be an expensive business and deciding on a career path at the end can be confusing without prior experience. Our sixth-form and undergraduate student opportunities offer financial assistance, personal development opportunities and the experience you need to make decisions about your future.</p>

<h2 id="desg-graduate-scheme">
<abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme</h2>

<p>For engineers and scientists this is probably the best graduate development scheme in the UK. Assuming no previous working experience, we will invest heavily on you (over and above your salary, there will be considerable investment in support of your professional development) aiming to take you through to chartered status in your profession within just 4 years of commencing the scheme.</p>

<h3 id="details-of-the-desg-graduate-scheme">Details of the <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme</h3>
<p>The prestigious <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme has been an industry leader for almost 30 years, launching hundreds of graduates into satisfying careers in engineering or science. The scheme is accredited by a number of professional institutions including IMeche, IET, RINA, IoP, IMarEST and RAeS.</p>

<p>The scheme is tailored to individual development needs to ensure that you have the best possible preparation for your first professional post and your subsequent career in MOD Civil Service. The scheme will last for a maximum of two years (reduced for graduates with previous experience) and includes a range of in-house work placements, industry secondments and formal training courses. There is no age limit for entry to the Graduate Scheme, but, it is designed for graduates with little or no work experience in engineering and science and may not benefit those who have significant previous experience.</p>

<p>Most graduates are based in Bristol, Bath, London, Waddington, Clyde or Plymouth. Work placements during the graduate scheme, however, can be located anywhere in the UK or overseas. At the end of the graduate scheme, most graduates take up permanent appointments in the above areas.</p>

<p>On entry to the scheme, you will be assigned to a Specialist Stream or Engineering System Anchor, taking into account your degree discipline and preferences wherever possible.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/engineering-system-anchors">Engineering System Anchors document</a> for more details and a guide to the ESAs that you can work in with a given degree - other choices may be possible. Contact us for further advice.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about the scheme, please see the Grad Fact Sheet in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mod-desg-graduate-trainee"><abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="accreditations">Accreditations</h3>

<p>Chartered Engineers and Scientists are an important asset to the Ministry of Defence and as a result the scheme has developed in accordance with the requirements of many Professional Institutions. This has allowed for formal development plans to be applied to the scheme with the aim of our graduates achieving Charted status.</p>

<p>Your school or college must supply a reference showing that you are expected to achieve the minimum entry requirements. Candidates must also be capable of taking mathematics and preferably physics and two other subjects for the first year of their sixth form, as well as an ICT Course.</p>

<p>Tuition is paid for by the MOD. Parents or guardians are required to make a contribution towards the cost of their child’s maintenance, which covers board, lodging and the value of clothing and services provided.</p>

<p>The level of contribution is determined on the basis of the parents’ or guardians’ residual or disposable income after allowance is made for other children, mortgage payments and other amounts normally acceped by the Inland Revenue. No other boarding school offers such a comprehensive and high-quality education as such low cost.</p>

<h2 id="how-desg-works">How <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> works</h2>

<p>The MOD is made up of a number of organisations, agencies and trading funds. The <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduate Scheme recruits on behalf of Defence Equipment and Support (<abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr>), the organisation that equips and supports the UK’s armed forces for current and future operations. It acquires and supports through-life, including disposal, equipment and services ranging from ships, aircraft, vehicles and weapons, to electronic systems and information services.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> also satisfies ongoing requirements including food, clothing, medical supplies, maintenance and temporary accommodation, as well as operating HM Naval Bases and joint supply chain for land, sea and air.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> works closely with industry through partnering agreements and private finance initiatives in accordance with the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) to deliver effective solutions for defence.</p>

<p>Formed from the merger of the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO), with headquarters in Bristol, <abbr title="Defence Equipment and Support">DE&amp;S</abbr> has around 29,000 people based at sites across the UK and abroad. It has an annual spend of £16 billion representing 43 percent of the Defence Budget.</p>

<h2 id="desg-technology">
<abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Technology</h2>

<p>The UK needs modern, battle-winning forces to defend UK interests and to contribute to strengthening international peace and security. These forces increasingly depend on scientific and technological advances to maintain their ability to operate effectively. Our Armed Forces must, therefore, have equipment and capabilities that give a decisive technological edge over any potential opponent and remain compatible with those of our Allies.</p>

<p>Countering new types of threats as they emerge will be a key challenge to UK forces in the future. We therefore place a premium on the ability to generate and identify innovative technologies, adopt them for military use and integrate them rapidly into platforms, weapon systems and force structures.</p>

<h3 id="taranis-a-bond-worthy-automaton">Taranis: a Bond-worthy automaton</h3>

<p>An example of this is Taranis, of which the Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taranis…is something that would not be out of place in the latest James Bond film - a pilotless combat aircraft for the British Armed Forces that will be capable of delivering weapons to a battlefield in another continent with almost no need for operator input. It does not come much more exciting than that!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bloodhound-a-record-breaking-project">Bloodhound, a Record-breaking project</h3>

<p>Just one more example of work that <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduates are a part of is the Bloodhound, Supersonic Car project. <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> Graduates have helped to overcome many technical challenges over the years and the quest for a car that will exceed 1,000 mph is no exception.</p>

<p>Ever wondered how most equipment gets to the front line fast? It’s not by boat, nor land, and it’s most definitely not just a simple question of putting it on a sling. The Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit (JADTEU) is an example of a team where <abbr title="The Defence Engineering &amp; Science Group">DESG</abbr> graduates can work. Working on tight time schedules, graduates have been helping solve complex engineering problems ranging from how to parachute someone safely from never attempted heights, speeds or places, to how to transport the latest tanks to the field, and how many we can carry safely.</p>
