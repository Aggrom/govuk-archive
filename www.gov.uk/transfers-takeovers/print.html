  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>When a business changes owner, its employees may be protected under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations (<abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr>).</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> protection</h2>
<p><abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> applies to employees of businesses in the UK. The business could have its head office in another country, but the part of the business that’s transferring ownership must be in the UK. The size of the business doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>In a transfer where <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> applies, the employees’:</p>

<ul>
<li>jobs transfer over to the new company (unless they’re made <a href="/staff-redundant" title="Making staff redundant">redundant</a> or in some cases where the business is <a href="/transfers-takeovers/insolvent-businesses" title="Insolvent businesses">insolvent</a>
</li>
  <li>employment terms and conditions transfer</li>
  <li>continuity of employment is maintained</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To find out if <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> applies to your transfer, talk to <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1410" title="Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)" rel="external">Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service),</a> <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm" title="Citizens Advice" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a> or, if you’re an employee, your trade union representative.</p>
</div>

<h2>When <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> applies</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of transfer protected under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> regulations:</p>

<ul>
<li>business transfers</li>
  <li>service provision changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Public sector transfers aren’t usually covered by <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> - unless transferring into the private sector. However, public-sector employees get similar protection. Read the guidelines below to find out more.</p>

<div class="form-download">
<p><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/staff_transfers_145.pdf" title="Download 'Guidelines - staff transfers in the public sector' (PDF, 145KB)" rel="external">Download ‘Guidelines - staff transfers in the public sector’ (PDF, 145KB)</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Business transfers</h3>
<p>This is where a business or part of a business moves from one employer to another. This can include mergers where 2 companies close and combine to form a new one. </p>

<p>To be protected under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> during a business transfer the identity of the employer must change.</p>

<h3>Service provision changes</h3>
<p>This is when:</p>

<ul>
<li>a service provided in-house (eg cleaning, workplace catering) is awarded to a contractor </li>
  <li>a contract ends and is given to a new contractor</li>
  <li>a contract ends and the work is transferred in-house by the former customer </li>
</ul>
<p>Employees aren’t protected under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> if the contract is:</p>

<ul>
<li>for the supply of goods for the company’s use (eg a restaurant changing food suppliers)</li>
  <li>for a single event or short-term task (eg a catering company being used for a large corporate event)</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the employees who can be clearly identified as providing the service being transferred are protected.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<p>A courier collects and delivers for a business, but the packages are picked up or delivered by a number of different couriers on an ad hoc basis. The courier isn’t protected under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>A cleaner is employed by a company that decides to use an outside cleaning company instead. They’re likely to be protected under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr>.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="consulting-and-informing"><header><h1>Part 2: Consulting and informing</h1>
  </header><p>Before a transfer of ownership happens, employers must tell the trade union or employee representatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>that the transfer is happening, when it’s happening and why</li>
  <li>how the transfer will affect them</li>
  <li>whether there’ll be any reorganisation</li>
  <li>how many agency workers they’re using and what types of work those workers are doing</li>
</ul>
<p>If employers don’t do this, they can be penalised.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Employers must consult employee representatives about anything to do with the transfer that would affect the employees (eg reorganisation). They should try to gain agreement about these changes.</p>
</div>

<h3>Trade union representatives</h3>

<p>If there’s a trade union in the workplace, the employer must inform and consult with the representatives from the union. </p>

<h3>Employee representatives</h3>

<p>If there’s no trade union the employer must inform and consult other employee representatives. There might already be representatives, or new ones can be specially elected. </p>

<p>If this happens the employer should:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure the election is fair</li>
  <li>decide how many people are needed to represent the interests of everyone affected</li>
  <li>decide if affected employees should be represented as one workforce or in groups</li>
  <li>decide how long the representatives need to be in place</li>
</ul>
<p>They should also make sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the employee representatives are people who are affected by the transfer</li>
  <li>no affected employee is unreasonably excluded from standing for election</li>
  <li>all affected employees at the time of the election are entitled to vote </li>
  <li>employees can vote for as many candidates as there are positions to be filled</li>
  <li>if possible, voting is done in secret </li>
  <li>votes are accurately counted</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re an employee representative you have <a href="/rights-of-trade-union-reps" title="The rights of trade union reps">the same rights as a trade union representative</a> to help you carry out your role.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="transfers-of-employment-contracts"><header><h1>Part 3: Transfers of employment contracts</h1>
  </header><p>Under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr>, the new employer takes over employees’ employment contracts, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>all the previous terms and conditions of employment</li>
  <li>any failures of the previous employer to observe employees’ rights (so employees could make a claim for discrimination against the new employer, even if it took place before the transfer)</li>
  <li><a href="/holiday-entitlement-rights" title="holiday entitlement">holiday entitlement</a></li>
  <li>period of <a href="/continuous-employment-what-it-is" title="continuous employment">continuous employment</a> - an employee’s start date is the same as before the transfer, so continuous employment isn’t broken</li>
  <li>any collective agreements previously made</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the new employer doesn’t meet the terms of the employment contract, it’s a breach of contract.</p>
</div>

<h2>If an employee doesn’t want to work for the new employer</h2>

<p>Employees can refuse to work for the new employer. This is the same as resigning - they won’t normally be able to claim unfair dismissal or redundancy pay.</p>

<p>Notice isn’t required. The employee simply tells the employer, or the new employer, before the transfer happens. Employment then ends at the time of transfer.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If an employee’s working conditions are significantly worse because of the transfer, they can object to the transfer, or resign and claim unfair dismissal.</p>
</div>

<h2>Changing an employment contract</h2>

<p><abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> regulations mean employees shouldn’t lose their existing employment rights. </p>

<h3>Before the transfer</h3>
<p>If the employer knows an employee is transferring to another company, they can’t normally change the employee’s terms and conditions to make them the same as those of the other company - even if the employee agrees to the change.</p>

<h3>After the transfer</h3>
<p>The new employer can’t change an employee’s terms and conditions if the reason is:</p>

<ul>
<li>the transfer itself</li>
  <li>connected with the transfer and not an ‘economic, technical or organisational reason’ involving changes in the workforce (eg as a result of redundancies or a move from a managerial to a non-managerial position)</li>
</ul>
<p>‘Economic’ reasons are to do with how the company is performing.</p>

<p>‘Technical’ reasons are to do with the equipment or processes the company uses. </p>

<p>‘Organisational’ reasons are to do with the structure of the company.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>An employer can change an employee’s terms and conditions if the reason isn’t connected to the transfer.</p>
</div>

<h3>Positive changes</h3>

<p>Employers can improve employees’ terms and conditions if they agree. For example, they might want to increase the amount of holiday so that it’s the same for everyone.</p>

<p>An employer can’t normally impose changes - they have to be agreed by the employees or their representatives.</p>

<h2>Pension rights</h2>

<p>Employees’ company pension rights earned up to the time of a transfer are protected, but the new employer doesn’t have to continue an identical pension. </p>

<h2>After the transfer</h2>

<p>When the transfer is complete, employees should make sure they get an up-to-date written statement of employment, giving the name of the new employer and saying that their terms and conditions haven’t changed.</p>

<p>Employees might get a P45 if their tax records are being updated.</p>


</article><article id="redundancy"><header><h1>Part 4: Redundancy</h1>
  </header><p>The new employer can’t <a href="/redundant-your-rights" title="being made redundant: your rights">make employees redundant</a> just because they were transferred from another employer.</p>

<p>If an employee is made redundant for an <a href="/transfers-takeovers/transfers-of-employment-contracts" title="Transfers of employment contracts">‘economic, organisational or technical’</a> reason involving changes to the workforce, they may be entitled to a redundancy payment. </p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>After a transfer, a new employer has to close down part of a company because it’s not performing. This means the business doesn’t need people with a certain specialist skill, and therefore makes an employee redundant. The employee could be entitled to a redundancy payment.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="information-about-employees-during-transfers"><header><h1>Part 5: Information about employees during transfers</h1>
  </header><p>An employer must provide the new employer with information about employees. This normally includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>name</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>main details of employment</li>
  <li>disciplinary action taken against employees in the last 2 years</li>
  <li>
<a href="/raise-grievance-at-work" title="grievances">grievances</a> raised by employees in the last 2 years</li>
  <li>
<a href="/employment-tribunals" title="employment tribunals">legal action</a> taken by employees against the employer in the last 2 years</li>
  <li>potential legal action the employer thinks employees might raise</li>
</ul>
<p>This information has to be provided at least 2 weeks before the transfer and should help the new employer understand employees’ rights and their duties.</p>

</article><article id="insolvent-businesses"><header><h1>Part 6: Insolvent businesses</h1>
  </header><p>If the employer is <a href="/your-rights-if-your-employer-is-insolvent" title="rights if your employer is insolvent">insolvent</a> and the business is being transferred or taken over by another company, the protection employees get is different from in a normal transfer.</p>

<p>The employees are unlikely to be protected under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> if the business is closing down. However, if it’s being rescued and taken over or transferred, <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> regulations will normally apply.</p>

<h2>If employees are owed money</h2>

<p>Employees have <a href="/your-rights-if-your-employer-is-insolvent" title="rights if your employer is insolvent">rights if their employer is insolvent</a> and owes them money. Employees can claim for this whether they’re protected under <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> or not.</p>

<p>In a <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr>-protected transfer, the new employer must pay any amount left over after employees have been paid from the government’s National Insurance fund.</p>

<h2>Changes to employees’ terms and conditions</h2>

<p>Employees’ pay can be reduced or their other <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="employment contracts">terms and conditions</a> changed after the transfer. This is allowed if it will prevent job losses.</p>

<p>Any changes must be agreed with employee or trade union representatives.</p>

<p>Any agreement can’t break statutory employment rights. For example, employees can’t be paid below the <a href="/your-right-to-minimum-wage" title="minimum wage">National Minimum Wage</a>.</p>


</article><article id="employees-working-abroad"><header><h1>Part 7: Employees working abroad</h1>
  </header><p>Employees of a UK business who are based outside the UK could still be protected by <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr>. </p>

<p>In business transfers, if a business has an ‘undertaking’ in the UK (eg building, assets, fixtures and fittings, employees) but an employee spends most of the working week outside the UK, it’s likely they’re protected.</p>

<p>In service provision changes, there must be an organised group of employees in England, Scotland or Wales to qualify for <abbr title="Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)">TUPE</abbr> protection.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>A team is doing website maintenance under a contract that’s coming to an end and someone else is taking it over:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>if the contract is performed in the UK, but one team member works from home in a country other than England, Scotland and Wales, it’s likely they’re protected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the whole team works from home in a country other than England, Scotland or Wales, the members wouldn’t be protected as there’s no organised group of employees in one of those countries</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>


</article><article id="help-and-advice"><header><h1>Part 8: Help and advice</h1>
  </header><p>Both employers and employees can get confidential help and advice on employment rights from <a rel="external" href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1410" title="contact Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)"><abbr title="the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service">Acas</abbr> (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service).</a> </p>

<p>Employees can also talk to <a rel="external" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm" title="Citizens Advice">Citizens Advice</a> or their trade union representative.</p>
