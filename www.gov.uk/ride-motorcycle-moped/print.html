  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you want to ride a motorcycle on the road you first need to complete <a href="/cbt-compulsory-basic-training" title="compulsory basic training (CBT)">compulsory basic training (CBT)</a>. </p>

<p>If you want to ride a moped you first need to complete CBT unless you passed your full car driving test before 1 February 2001. In this case you can ride a moped, <strong>but still need to complete CBT to ride a motorcycle</strong>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Once you’ve completed CBT you have 2 years to pass your full motorcycle theory and practical tests or you’ll have to complete CBT again.</p>
</div>

<h2>Rules for learner riders</h2>

<p>When you’re learning you’ll need to have the right provisional driving licence. This depends on whether you want to ride a moped or motorcycle.</p>

<p>If you’re using your own vehicle you’ll need to make sure it:</p>

<ul>
<li>is registered</li>
  <li>is taxed</li>
  <li>has an MOT (if needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need adequate motor insurance.</p>

<h2>Taking the full motorcycle tests</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>All riders have to pass the <a href="/driving-theory-test" title="theory test">theory test</a> <strong>before</strong> taking the motorcycle <a href="/motorcycle-practical-test" title="practical test">practical test</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You can take the practical test on a motorcycle of between 75cc and 125cc.</p>

<p>The licence you’ll get depends on the type of bike you take the test on:</p>

<ul>
<li>a light motorcycle licence (A1), which restricts you to ride bikes of up to 125cc and with a power output of 11kW</li>
  <li>a standard motorcycle licence (A), if you take the test on a bike of over 120cc but not more than 125cc and able of doing at least 62mph</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get the standard motorcycle licence you’ll be restricted for 2 years to riding bikes of up to 25kW power output and a power/weight ratio not exceeding 0.16kW/kg.</p>

<p>After the 2 years you can then ride any size of bike.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you are 21 or over, or will reach 21 before this 2 year restriction ends, you have other options under the <a href="direct-and-accelerated-access" title="'direct access' and 'accelerated access' rules">‘direct access’ and ‘accelerated access’ rules</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>For more information about the different ways of getting a motorcycle or moped licence, <a rel="external" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/@motor/documents/digitalasset/dg_198666.pdf" title="download 'The routes to your motorcycle licence' (PDF, 90KB)">download ‘The routes to your motorcycle licence’ (PDF, 90KB).</a></p>

</article><article id="direct-and-accelerated-access"><header><h1>Part 2: Direct and accelerated access</h1>
  </header><p>You normally need to wait 2 years after passing your full motorcycle test before you can ride any size of bike.</p>

<p>If you are 21 or over, or will reach 21 before the 2 years ends, you have other options.</p>

<h2>Direct access</h2>

<p>If you’re 21 or over when you take the motorcycle <a href="/motorcycle-practical-test" title="practical test">practical test</a>, and pass the test on a motorcycle with a power output of at least 35kW then you can ride any size of bike.</p>

<p>You don’t need to have taken your Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) on a large bike.</p>

<h3>Rules for practicing on a large bike</h3>

<p>When you’re practicing for the practical test on a bike that is larger than a standard learner bike you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be accompanied at all times by an approved direct access instructor on another bike and in radio contact</li>
  <li>wear fluorescent or reflective clothing</li>
  <li>follow all other provisional licence restrictions </li>
</ul>
<h2>Accelerated access</h2>

<p>If you’ve passed the motorcycle <a href="/motorcycle-practical-test" title="practical test">practical test</a> but then reach 21 before the 2-year restriction period ends, you can take a further practical test for larger bikes of at least 35kW.</p>

<h3>Rules for practicing</h3>

<p>You can practice on bikes over 25kW, but must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be accompanied at all times by an approved instructor on another bike and in radio contact</li>
  <li>wear fluorescent or reflective clothing</li>
  <li>follow all other provisional licence restrictions </li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re practicing on a larger bike you will be classed as a learner rider.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you fail the test for a larger bike your existing motorcycle licence won’t be affected.</p>

<p>*You can ride a large motorcycle at any age 2 years after passing a test on a medium-sized motorcycle.</p>

</article><article id="sidecars-"><header><h1>Part 5: Sidecars </h1>
  </header><p>If you want to ride a motorcycle with a sidecar you can practice on a motorcycle/sidecar combination with a power/weight ratio not exceeding 0.16kW/kg.</p>

<p>For 2 years after passing your practical test you can only ride a combination with the same power/weight ratio as the one you took the test on. After the 2 years you can ride a larger combination.</p>

<p>If you are 21 when you take your practical test or will become 21 before the 2-year restriction ends, you can practice on larger motorcycle/sidecar combinations if you are taking <a href="direct-and-accelerated-access" title="direct or accelerated access">direct or accelerated access</a>.</p>

<p>However, you will still have to take your test on a solo bike, although physically disabled riders can use a combination.</p>

</article><article id="safety-equipment"><header><h1>Part 6: Safety equipment</h1>
  </header><h2>Helmet</h2>

<p>You must wear a safety helmet when riding a motorcycle on the road. All helmets sold in the UK must comply with at least one of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>British Standard BS 6658:1985 and carry the <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> (British Standards Institution) Kitemark</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 22.05</li>
  <li>any standard accepted by a member of the European Economic Area which offers a level of safety and protection equivalent to BS 6658:1985 and carry a mark equivalent to the <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> Kitemark</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you need glasses or contact lenses to read a number plate at the prescribed distance, you must wear them when you ride.</p>
</div>

<h2>Visors and goggles</h2>

<p>If you wear a visor or goggles when you ride, your visors or goggles must comply with either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a British Standard and displays a <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> Kitemark</li>
  <li>a European standard which offers a level of safety and protection at least equivalent to the British Standard and carries a mark equivalent to the <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> Kitemark (ECE 22-05)</li>
</ul></article><article id="the-enhanced-rider-scheme"><header><h1>Part 7: The enhanced rider scheme</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re a fully licensed motorcyclist and have passed your test you can take the enhanced rider scheme.</p>

<p>It checks your motorcycle riding skills and provides training to help you improve. There is no test.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Once you’ve successfully completed the scheme you could get discounts on motorcycle insurance.</p>
</div>

<p>The scheme is especially suitable if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have just passed your test</li>
  <li>are returning to riding after a break</li>
  <li>are upgrading to a more powerful motorcycle</li>
  <li>want to check your riding standard</li>
  <li>just want to make your riding more enjoyable</li>
</ul>
<h2>How the scheme works</h2>

<p>You’ll first have a rider assessment with an expert trainer. You’ll ride in different road and traffic conditions.</p>

<p>The ride will be long enough for your trainer to make a good assessment of your skills. For most people this is 1 - 2 hours.</p>

<p>If this shows you don’t need more training you’ll get a ‘<abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> certificate of competence’ straight away.</p>

<p>Otherwise you’ll get personalised training to improve your skills, and get the certificate at the end of your training.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Most insurance companies give discounts on motorcycle insurance if you’ve got a <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> certificate of competence.</p>
</div>

<p>The type of training depends on what you need to brush up on. You might be offered all-day courses or shorter sessions.</p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>The cost of the enhanced rider scheme depends on the trainer and your training needs.</p>
