<p>If you’re <strong>permanently</strong> importing a vehicle into the UK, you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>apply for <a href="mutual-recognition-and-type-approval" title="Mutual Recognition and type approval">‘Mutual Recognition’ or get type approval</a>

</ul>
<p>Until you’ve done this, you can’t keep or use the vehicle on public roads, except to drive it to pre-arranged appointments that are necessary to register it.</p>

<p>There are different rules if you’re <a href="temporary-imports" title="Temporary imports">temporarily importing a vehicle into the UK</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) advises you to transport your vehicle from the port, rather than driving it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Driving with a foreign registration number</h2>

<p>UK residents aren’t allowed to use non-UK registered vehicles on UK roads. The only exceptions are if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>work in another European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member state and use an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-registered company car temporarily in the UK</li>
  <li>lease an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-registered car and use this temporarily in the UK</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vehicles over 10 years old</h2>

<p>If you’re importing a vehicle into the UK that’s over 10 years old, <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/contactus/localoffices/findnear.aspx" title="Contact DVLA">contact <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr></a> to discuss registration. </p>


</article><article id="mutual-recognition-and-type-approval"><header><h1>Part 2: Mutual Recognition and type approval</h1>
  </header><p>You need to get a certificate of Mutual Recognition or type approval, depending on the type of vehicle and whether it was first registered within or outside the <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="Countries in the EU: Europa">European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</a></p>

<h2>Mutual Recognition scheme</h2>
<p>You must apply for the Mutual Recognition scheme if you’re importing a left-hand-drive car, motorcycle or light goods vehicle first registered <strong>within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></strong>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To find out if your vehicle qualifies for the Mutual Recognition scheme, contact the Vehicle Certification Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>) legislation team on 0117 952 4191.</p>
</div>

<p>The Mutual Recognition scheme (also known as the Commission Notice Procedure) asks you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make declarations about your vehicle’s suitability for use in Britain (eg the headlight beam dips to the left)</li>
  <li>make alterations if needed (eg fit rear seat belts) - and provide garage receipts to prove you’ve done this</li>
</ul>
<p>If your application is accepted, the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will give you a certificate. You need to present this to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) to support your application for registration.</p>

<p>You can download an application form, including guidance notes, below.</p>

<h2>European type approval</h2>

<p>You’ll need full European <a href="/vehicle-type-approval" title="Vehicle type approval">type approval</a> if you’re importing:</p>

<ul>
<li>a car, motorcycle or light goods vehicle first registered <strong>outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></strong>
</li>
  <li>a larger goods vehicle</li>
  <li>any vehicle that doesn’t have proof of European type approval (eg a certificate of conformity)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your vehicle gets type approval, you’ll be able to register it and it will be given a <a href="/vehicle-registration/q-registration-numbers" title=" Q registration numbers">‘Q’ prefix</a> or age-related registration number.</p>


</article><article id="vat-duty-and-tax-vehicles-from-within-the-eu"><header><h1>Part 3: VAT, duty and tax: vehicles from within the EU</h1>

  <li>tell <abbr title="Her Majesty's">HM</abbr> Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
<p>You do this by filling in certain forms depending on whether your vehicle is a New Means of Transport. </p>

<div class="example">
<p>Your vehicle is a <strong>‘New Means of Transport’</strong> if either:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s less than 6 months old</li>

</ul>
</div>

<h2>Paying <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h2>
<p>You don’t have to pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re importing a second-hand vehicle and you paid <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in another <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="Countries in the EU: Europa"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</a>  when you bought it</li>
  <li>you normally live in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country and you’re bringing a vehicle with you on a temporary visit to the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>In all other cases, you must pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on the vehicle, any accessories bought with the vehicle and any delivery or incidental charges. </p>

<p>You can do this at customs, or by using the forms below to tell <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Telling <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You must usually tell <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr> when importing a vehicle. The only exception is if you normally live in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country and are bringing a vehicle with you on a temporary visit to the UK. </p>

<p>If you have to tell <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr>, you must do this within 7 days of when the vehicle arrived in the UK or when you bought the vehicle (whichever is later). Otherwise, you may have to pay a fine.</p>

<p>Tell <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr> using 1 of the following forms:</p>

</ul></article><article id="vat-duty-and-tax-vehicles-from-outside-the-eu"><header><h1>Part 4: VAT, duty and tax: vehicles from outside the EU</h1>
  </header><p>If your vehicle is imported from outside the <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="Countries in the EU: Europa">European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>),</a> you may qualify for certain types of relief, meaning you don’t have to pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> or duty.</p>

<h3>Transfer of residence relief</h3>
<p>You won’t have to pay duty or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on the vehicle if you meet all these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’re moving your normal home to the UK</li>
  <li>you’ve had your normal home outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for a continuous period of at least 12 months</li>
  <li>you’ve owned and used the vehicle for at least 6 months outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you didn’t get the vehicle under a duty/tax-free scheme</li>
  <li>you’re going to keep the vehicle for your personal use for at least 12 months after it’s imported</li>
</ul>
<p>To claim the relief, fill in <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=cwjlXbaGs7Q&amp;formid=98" title="Form C104A">form C104A</a> and present it when you bring the vehicle into the country.</p>

<h3>Returned goods relief</h3>
<p>You won’t have to pay duty or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if you’re re-importing a vehicle that was previously exported out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, provided you meet all these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>the vehicle was taken outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by you within the past 3 years</li>
  <li>any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, duty or equivalent tax was paid on the vehicle in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and wasn’t refunded when the vehicle was taken outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the vehicle hasn’t been altered outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, other than necessary running repairs</li>
</ul>
<p>To claim the relief, drive your vehicle through the ‘green channel’. You must be able to show evidence that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the vehicle was exported</li>
  <li>you were the person who exported it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Temporary admission relief</h3>
<p>You won’t have to pay duty or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if you’re a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> resident and your vehicle is registered or belongs to a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> resident.</p>

<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
<li>be bringing the vehicle into the UK temporarily for your own private use</li>
  <li>re-export it from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> within 6 months - this time limit can be extended if you’re a student or undertaking an assignment of a specific duration </li>
  <li>not sell, lend or hire it out anywhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to notify <abbr title="Her Majesty's">HM</abbr> Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr>) to claim the relief. However, completing <a href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=i-925dmh8yY&amp;formId=111%20%E2%80%9CForm%20C110:%20Notice%20of%20arrival%20of%20a%20private%20motor%20vehicle%E2%80%9D" rel="external">form C110</a> can help customs identify you and might stop the vehicle being unnecessarily detained if the police carry out checks.</p>

<h3>Paying <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> or duty</h3>

<p>If you don’t qualify for a relief, you’ll have to pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> or duty by filling in:</p>

<ul>
<li>form C&amp;E 386 - if you’re an individual personally importing a vehicle </li>

<p>When <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Custom">HMRC</abbr> is satisfied that you, or the shipping agent, have paid duty and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> (if applicable), it will issue you with a form that lets you register the vehicle with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>).</p>
