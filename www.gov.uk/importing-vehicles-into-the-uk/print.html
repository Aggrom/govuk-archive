<p>If you’re <strong>permanently</strong> importing a vehicle into the UK, you must prove that it meets environmental and safety regulations or have an exemption from them. To do this you’ll need the right paperwork, which could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a copy of the European Certificate of Conformity (CofC) or <a href="/vehicle-approval" title="type approval certificate">type approval certificate</a> from the manufacturer or importer - suitable if it’s a right-hand-drive, UK specification vehicle</li>
  <li>a <a href="/importing-vehicles-into-the-uk/mutual-recognition" title="Mutual recognition">certificate of Mutual Recognition</a> - if the vehicle was approved and registered in the European Union</li>

<p>You must also:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Until you’ve done this, you can’t keep or use the vehicle on public roads, except to drive it to pre-arranged appointments that are necessary to register it.</p>

<p>There are different rules if you’re <a href="/importing-vehicles-into-the-uk/temporary-imports" title="Temporary imports">temporarily importing a vehicle into the UK</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) advises you to transport your vehicle from the port, rather than driving it.</p>
</div>

<h2>Driving with a foreign registration number</h2>

<p>UK residents aren’t allowed to use non-UK registered vehicles on UK roads. The only exceptions are if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>work in another European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) member state and use an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-registered company car temporarily in the UK</li>
  <li>lease an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-registered car and use this temporarily in the UK</li>

<p>If you’re importing a vehicle into Great Britain that’s over 10 years old, <a href="/contact-the-dvla" title="Get contact details for DVLA">contact <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr></a>, or the <a rel="external" href="http://www.dvlni.gov.uk/contactUs.htm" title="Contact DVA">Driver and Vehicle Agency</a> (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Agency">DVA</abbr>) in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>If the vehicle’s a goods vehicle over 3.5 tonnes, you can apply for <a href="/importing-vehicles-into-the-uk/mutual-recognition" title="Mutual recognition">Mutual Recognition.</a> </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The 10-year date is based on the date of manufacture or first registration.</p>

</article><article id="mutual-recognition"><header><h1>Part 2: Mutual Recognition</h1>
  </header><p>You may need to get a certificate of Mutual Recognition, depending on the type of vehicle and whether it was first registered within or outside the <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm" title="Countries in the EU: Europa">European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</a></p>

<h2>Mutual Recognition scheme</h2>

<p>You can apply for the Mutual Recognition scheme if you’re importing a left-hand-drive car, motorcycle or light goods vehicle first registered <strong>within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></strong>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To find out if your vehicle qualifies for the Mutual Recognition scheme, contact the Vehicle Certification Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>) legislation team on 0117 952 4191.</p>
</div>

<p>The Mutual Recognition scheme (also known as the Commission Notice Procedure) asks you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>make declarations about your vehicle’s suitability for use in Britain (eg the headlight beam dips to the left)</li>
  <li>make alterations if needed (eg fit rear seat belts) - and provide garage receipts to prove you’ve done this</li>
</ul>
<p>If your application is accepted, the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will give you a certificate. You need to present this to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>), or the Driver and Vehicle Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Agency">DVA</abbr>) in Northern Ireland, to support your application for registration.</p>

<p>You can do this at customs or when you report the imported vehicle.</p>

<p>You don’t have to pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>

  <li>it’s a temporary import and you normally live in the EU</li>
</ul>
<h2>Report an imported vehicle</h2>

<p>You must tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> you’re importing a vehicle unless it’s a temporary import and you’re from the EU. </p>

<p>Send <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> one of the forms below within 7 days of importing the vehicle or buying it (whichever is later). If you don’t, you may be fined. </p>
