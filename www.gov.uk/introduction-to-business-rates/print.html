</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Business rates are charged on most non-domestic properties (including commercial) such as shops, offices, pubs, warehouses and factories. </p>

<p>If you use a building or part of a building for non-domestic purposes, you will probably have to pay business rates. This is a tax that helps pay for local services.  </p>

<h2>What to pay and when</h2>
<p>Your local council will send you a business rates bill in February or March each year. This is for the following tax year. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Estimate your business rates bill using this <a href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/logicToolStart?itemId=1080355722&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.l2=1073859221&amp;r.l3=1080355862&amp;type=BLTTOOL" title="Estimate your business rates bill" rel="external">simple calculator.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Relief schemes</h2>
<p>You may be able to get business rates relief - this is sometimes automatic but you will need to <a href="/apply-for-business-rate-relief/" title="Apply for business rate relief">apply for business rate relief</a> in some cases. </p>

<h2>Who doesn’t need to pay</h2>
<p>Exemptions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>farm buildings and land (excluding buildings used as offices or for other business activities)</li>
  <li>fish farms</li>
  <li>places of worship and church halls</li>
  <li>buildings used for training or welfare of disabled people</li>
</ul></article><article id="how-your-rates-are-calculated"><header><h1>Part 2: How your rates are calculated</h1>
  </header><p>Your business rates are worked out by multiplying the:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘rateable value’ of your property set by the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>business rates multiplier set by central government</li>
</ul>
<p>The rateable value of a property is based on its estimated open market rental value on a specific date.  </p>

<p>You may pay less than this amount if you are eligible for any <a href="/apply-for-business-rate-relief" title="Business rate relief">reliefs</a>.  </p>

<p>If you think <strong>your rates are wrong</strong>, contact the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>.</p>

</article><article id="revaluation"><header><h1>Part 3: Revaluation</h1>
  </header><p>Revaluation takes place every 5 years to reflect changes in the property market. The most recent revaluation was 1 April 2010. </p>

<p>At revaluation, the multipliers are revised so that the overall national business rates bill only changes in line with inflation. This means that a change in your rateable value doesn’t always mean a change in your bill.</p>

<ul>
<li>you move or make changes to your premises</li>
  <li>the nature of your business changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) to report any changes. This will ensure you’re paying the right amount and don’t get a backdated increase in your bill. </p>

</article><article id="working-from-home"><header><h1>Part 6: Working from home</h1>
  </header><p>If you work at home, you may have to pay business rates on the part of your property that you use. This depends on whether the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) has given a rateable value to a part of your home. You will still have to pay Council Tax on the rest of your property. </p>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> if you’re not sure if you should be paying business rates or not.</p>

</article><article id="pubs-and-licensed-trade"><header><h1>Part 7: Pubs and licensed trade</h1>
  </header><p>The Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) works out your rateable pay based on the annual level of trade that a pub is expected to achieve if operated in a reasonably efficient way. </p>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> if you want to check the figures they’re using or don’t agree with the figures being used. You’ll need to provide details of turnover (excluding VAT) for all sources like liquor, food and gaming. </p>

</article><article id="self-catering-and-holiday-let-accommodation"><header><h1>Part 8: Self catering and holiday let accommodation</h1>
  </header><p>If your property is available to let for 140 days or more a year, it will be rated as a self-catering property and valued for business rates. </p>

<p>The Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) calculates the rateable value based on the number of single bed spaces in the property. They then apply a price per bed space on each property, based on its type, size and location, to produce its rateable value. </p>

<p>Single bed space is the term used to describe how many people can sleep in the property. This doesn’t normally include bunk beds or sofa beds. </p>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> if you think:</p>

<ul>
<li>they are using the wrong number of single bed spaces to value your property</li>
  <li>your property has changed and can now sleep a different number of guests</li>
</ul>
