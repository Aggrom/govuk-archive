  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Business rates are taxes to help pay for local services.  They’re charged on most non-domestic properties (including commercial), eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>shops </li>
  <li>offices</li>
  <li>pubs</li>
  <li>warehouses</li>
  <li>factories </li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a building or part of a building for non-domestic purposes, you’ll probably have to pay business rates. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Business rates are handled differently in <a href="http://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.i=5001765655&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.l2=1073859221&amp;r.l3=5001765644&amp;r.s=m&amp;r.t=RESOURCES&amp;site=191&amp;topicId=5001765644" title="business rates in Northern Ireland" rel="external">Northern Ireland.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>What to pay and when</h2>
<p>Your local council will send you a business rates bill in February or March each year. This is for the following tax year. You can also <a href="/calculate-your-business-rates" title="estimate your business rates">estimate your business rates bill</a>.</p>

<h2>Relief schemes</h2>
<p>You may be able to get business rates relief. This is sometimes automatic, but you’ll need to apply through your local council in some cases. </p>

<p>The process depends on where you are:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Who doesn’t need to pay</h2>
<p>Exemptions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>farm buildings and land (excluding buildings used as offices or for other business activities)</li>
  <li>fish farms</li>
  <li>places of worship and church halls (except in Scotland - you apply for relief for these buildings instead of being exempt)</li>
  <li>buildings used for training or welfare of disabled people (except in Scotland - you apply for relief for these buildings instead of being exempt)</li>
</ul></article><article id="how-your-rates-are-calculated"><header><h1>Part 2: How your rates are calculated</h1>
  </header><p>In England and Wales, business rates are worked out by multiplying the:</p>

<ul>
<li>‘rateable value’ of your property set by the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) </li>
  <li>business rates multiplier set by central government</li>
</ul>
<p>In Scotland, they’re worked out using the rateable value set by the local assessor and the ‘poundage rate’ (a proportion of your rateable value) set by the Scottish Government.</p>

<p>The rateable value of a property is based on its estimated open market rental value on a specific date.  </p>

<p>You may pay less than this if you’re eligible for any reliefs.  </p>

<h3>If you think your rates are wrong</h3>

<p>If you’re in England or Wales, contact the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’re in Scotland, contact your local assessor - you can look them up on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.saa.gov.uk/saacontacts.php" title="Scottish Assessors Association website">Scottish Assessors Association website.</a></p>


</article><article id="revaluation"><header><h1>Part 3: Revaluation</h1>
  </header><p>Revaluation takes place every 5 years to reflect changes in the property market. The most recent revaluation was 1 April 2010. </p>

<p>At revaluation, the multipliers (poundages in Scotland) are revised so that the overall national business rates bill only changes in line with inflation. </p>

<p>This means that a change in your rateable value doesn’t always mean a change in your bill.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To make sure your valuations are accurate, you must give the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) or your assessor up-to-date rental evidence for your property at revaluation.</p>

<ul>
<li>you move or make changes to your premises</li>

<p>You must report any changes to ensure you’re paying the right amount and don’t get a backdated increase in your bill. </p>

  </header><p>If you work at home, you may have to pay business rates on the part of your property that you use. </p>

<p>This depends on whether the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) - or local assessor in Scotland - has given a rateable value to a part of your home. You’ll still have to pay Council Tax on the rest of your property. </p>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> if you’re not sure if you should be paying business rates or not. In Scotland, contact your <a rel="external" href="http://www.saa.gov.uk/saacontacts.php" title="contact your local assessor">local assessor.</a></p>

</article><article id="pubs-and-licensed-trade"><header><h1>Part 7: Pubs and licensed trade</h1>
  </header><p>In England and Wales, the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) works out your rateable value based on the annual level of trade that a pub is expected to achieve if operated in a reasonably efficient way. </p>

<p>In Scotland, your local assessor works this out using the relationship between the level of trade and rents in the market. </p>

</article><article id="self-catering-and-holiday-let-accommodation"><header><h1>Part 8: Self-catering and holiday let accommodation</h1>
  </header><p>If your property is available to let for 140 days or more a year, it will be rated as a self-catering property and valued for business rates. </p>

<p>This is worked out differently depending on where the property is.</p>

<p>In <strong>England and Wales</strong>, the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>) calculates the rateable value based on the number of single bed spaces in the property. </p>

<p>In <strong>Scotland</strong>, the local assessor calculates this based on an anaysis of rents and revenue. </p>

<p>The <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> or assessor then applies a price per bed space on each property, based on its type, size and location, to produce its rateable value. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Single bed space is the term used to describe how many people can sleep in the property. This doesn’t normally include bunk beds or sofa beds unless the property’s in Scotland.</p>
</div>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> or the <a rel="external" href="http://www.saa.gov.uk/saacontacts.php" title="contact your local assessor">local assessor</a> if you think:</p>

<ul>
<li>they are using the wrong number of single bed spaces to value your property</li>
  <li>your property has changed and can now sleep a different number of guests</li>
