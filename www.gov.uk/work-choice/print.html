  </header><p>Work Choice can help you get and keep a job if you’re disabled and find it hard to work. </p>

<p>It’s voluntary - you don’t have to do it. The type of support you get depends on the help you need. This is different for everyone but can include: </p>

<ul>
<li>training and developing your skills </li>
  <li>building your confidence</li>
  <li>interview coaching</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You can’t get Work Choice in <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/people-with-disabilities/employment-support/work-schemes-and-programmes.htm" title="Work schemes and programmes for disabled people in Northern Ireland" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a> - they have different schemes instead.</p>

<p>Work Choice replaced WORKSTEP and Work Preparation. The Job Introduction Scheme has not been replaced and has now stopped.</p>

</article><article id="what-youll-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What you'll get</h1>
  </header><p>You can get support to help you find, keep and get on in a job. </p>

<p>The type of help you get depends on what you need - it’s different for everyone. For example, you might get help with:</p>

<ul>
<li>training </li>
  <li>building your confidence</li>
  <li>finding a job that suits you</li>
  <li>interview coaching</li>
  <li>developing your skills</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll have an interview to see what support you need when you join Work Choice. </p>

<h2>How Work Choice works</h2>

<p>Work Choice is delivered by different providers across the country. They offer 3 levels of help. </p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Level of help</th>
      <th>What you get</th>
      <th>How long it lasts</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Work Entry Support</td>
      <td>Advice on work and personal skills to help you find a job</td>
      <td>Up to 6 months</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>In-Work Support</td>
      <td>Help to start work and stay in your job</td>
      <td>Up to 2 years</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Longer-term In-Work Support</td>
      <td>Help to get on in your job and work without support</td>
      <td>Long-term</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Work Entry Support can be extended by 3 or 6 months in exceptional circumstances and when there is a clear prospect of a job. </p>

<h2>Complaints</h2>
