  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>A local bus service uses public service vehicles (PSVs) to carry passengers who pay separate fares over short distances. </p>

<p>The route can be any length, as long as passengers can get off within 15 miles (measured in a straight line) of where they got on.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> 
An express service runs from Bristol to Chepstow. You may think it doesn’t need to be registered as your passenger will travel more than 15 miles between where they get on and off. However, it does need to be registered because it’s less than 15 miles in a straight line.</p>
</div>

<p>With <a href="/run-local-bus-service/exemptions" title="Exemptions">a few exceptions</a> local services operating outside London must be registered with the local <a rel="external" href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/tpm/traffic-commissioners" title="Traffic commissioners">traffic commissioner.</a></p>

<p>To <a href="/run-local-bus-service/register-a-bus-service-in-london" title="Register a bus services in London">run a service in London</a> you need a London Service Permit.</p>

<h2>Who can register</h2>

<p>You can register a local bus service if you:</p>

</li>
  <li>hold a community bus permit</li>
  <li>are a local education authority and want to provide a local service using a school bus belonging to you</li>
</ul>
<p>Taxi or private hire vehicle owners can also register by getting a <a href="/psv-operator-licences" title="special PSV operator licences">special PSV operator’s licence</a>.</p>

<h2>Before you register</h2>

  <li>you have the right sort of vehicles</li>
  <li>you can keep to the timetable given the traffic conditions on route</li>
  <li>you have enough drivers to cover absences though sicknesses, holidays, etc</li>
  <li>you have replacement vehicles if other vehicles are off-road</li>

</li>
  <li>a Quality Partnership or Quality Contract Scheme exists - contact your <a href="/find-your-local-council" title="Find your local council">local transport authority</a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll have to run the service just as you have registered it, even if staff members are ill or a vehicle is off the road. There are <a href="/run-local-bus-service/penalties-for-poor-service" title="Penalties for poor service">penalties</a> if you don’t.</p>
</div>

</article><article id="how-to-register"><header><h1>Part 2: How to register</h1>

</div>

<ul>
<li>someone other than you or your agent is responsible for arranging the journey and bringing the passengers together</li>
  <li>the journey is not advertised in advance to the general public</li>
  <li>all passengers travel together to or from the same place - eg a school or factory</li>
  <li>passengers pay the same fare no matter how far they travel</li>
</ul>
<h2>School or college bus services</h2>
<p>If you operate a bus service provided by a local education authority in England or Wales, you may not have to register it.</p>

<ul>
<li>studying at a school or college</li>
  <li>supervising pupils or students</li>
  <li>teachers or assistants working at the school or college</li>
</ul>
<p>If other people can also use the service, it must be registered.</p>

<h2>Other exemptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>a replacement bus service (eg when a train service is temporarily cancelled and a bus is used instead) provided under an agreement with the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers or the National Assembly for Wales</li>
  <li>excursions or tours - unless they operate once a week or more for at least 6 weeks in a row</li>

<ul>
<li>prevent dangers to other road users </li>
  <li>reduce traffic congestion </li>
  <li>limit environmental pollution </li>
</ul>
<p>The conditions could affect: </p>

<ul>
<li>your bus routes</li>
  <li>where you can stop </li>
  <li>when you can stop and for how long </li>
  <li>where you can turn or reverse</li>
  <li>the number of vehicles, their type or their frequency </li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the conditions will start straight away. </p>

<h2>You can’t meet the conditions</h2>
<p>You must <a href="/run-local-bus-service/changing-or-cancelling-a-bus-service" title="changing or cancelling a bus service">change the registration</a> within 28 days if you can’t run your service under the conditions. You won’t have to pay a fee if you change the registration because of these conditions. You must meet the conditions until the change of registration takes effect.</p>

<h2>You disagree with the conditions</h2>
<p>If you disagree with the traffic commissioner’s decision you can ask for a public inquiry within 28 days. </p>

</ul>
<h2>Penalties</h2>
<p>If you don’t run a reliable or punctual service the traffic commissioner can stop you from running the service - or even running any services at all.</p>

<p>The traffic commissioner can also fine you. The size of the fine is based on the number of vehicles you’re licensed to use.</p>

<p>If you provide the local bus service in England and Wales, you may also have to:</p>

<ul>

  </header><p>Your local bus service might qualify for a grant if it provides a service to the general public where:</p>

<ul>
<li>at least half the seats are available to and regularly used by them</li>
  <li>bus stops are in places where people are likely to use them reasonably often</li>
  <li>if there aren’t fixed stopping places, the arrangements for letting passengers on and off mean people are likely to use them reasonably often</li>
  <li>single journey fares are reasonably priced</li>
  <li>they can pay fares conveniently</li>
  <li>the bus doesn’t have any sign or other indication that it’s not available to them</li>
  <li>information about the service, its route and timetable is accessible to them</li>
  <li>if it’s a flexible service, where passengers book in advance, these arrangements mustn’t deter people who want to make a single journey</li>
