  </header><p>If you’re a commercial driver, you could be stopped by an officer from the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) or the police to inspect your vehicle.</p>

<p>They’ll also make sure you’re not committing an offence. Examples of this can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>driving an overloaded vehicle</li>
  <li>breaking the rules on drivers’ hours and tachographs</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> officers and the police can issue fixed penalties if you commit an offence. Some of these are graduated depending on the circumstances and seriousness of the offence.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If your vehicle exceeds its maximum permitted axle weight, the penalties are:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Vehicle overweight by</th>
      <th>Penalty</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5% to 10%</td>
      <td>£60</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>10% to 15%</td>
      <td>£120</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>15% to 30%</td>
      <td>£200</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>more than 30%</td>
      <td>court summons</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For drivers’ hours offences, the penalties are:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Maximum daily driving time exceeded by</th>
      <th>Penalty</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>up to an hour</td>
      <td>£60</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>1 to 2 hours</td>
      <td>£120</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>2 or more hours</td>
      <td>£200</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has published a guide to fixed penalties as well as a policy for road traffic offences, which includes a list of offences and penalty fine levels.</p>

<h2>Endorsements to your driving licence</h2>

<p>For some offences, you’ll get points added to your licence (endorsements) as well as a fine. For example, if your vehicle has defective brakes, you’ll be given a £60 fine and 3 points on your licence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If the offence is endorsable, you must present your driving licence within 14 days.</p>
</div>


</article><article id="fixed-penalty-notices"><header><h1>Part 2: Fixed penalty notices</h1>
  </header><p>If you have a UK address, you’ll have 28 days from when you’re given a fixed penalty notice to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay the fine</li>
  <li>ask for a court hearing if you want to appeal</li>
</ul>
<p>In Scotland, you’ll get a ‘conditional offer’ instead of a fixed penalty notice. You get 28 days from the date of issue to pay the fine. After this, you could be prosecuted if you don’t pay.</p>

<h3>If you don’t have a UK address</h3>

<p>You’ll have to pay a ‘financial penalty deposit’. This will be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the total of all fixed penalty notices issued (if you want to appeal, you must do so within 28 days)</li>
  <li>£300 per offence if you go to court (this depends on the seriousness and number of offences - you’ll have to pay on the spot and and go to court later)</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases the maximum amount you’ll have to pay as a deposit is £900. You have to pay this straight away - if you don’t, you might not be allowed to drive your vehicle.</p>

<p>The money from deposits is used to pay any fixed penalties or court fines. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll be refunded any money left over from your deposit after fines have been paid.</p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t pay the deposit, your vehicle will be <a href="what-happens-if-your-vehicle-is-immobilised" title="what happens if your vehicle is immobilised">immobilised</a>.</p>

</article><article id="what-happens-if-your-vehicle-is-immobilised"><header><h1>Part 3: What happens if your vehicle is immobilised</h1>
  </header><p>If you’re stopped by a Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) officer or the police, they might immobilise your vehicle.</p>

<p>This might happen if you’ve committed a serious enough offence to get an <a href="/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/roadside-prohibitions" title="roadside prohibitions">‘immediate prohibition’</a>. </p>

<p>An immediate prohibition is used to prevent risks to road safety (eg an unroadworthy vehicle or a tired driver). It means you won’t be able to drive your vehicle until the problem is sorted out. </p>

<h2>When your vehicle could be immobilised</h2>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> or the police can also immobilise your vehicle at the roadside if an immediate prohibiton is issued for any of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>you’ve broken the rules on drivers’ hours and tachographs</li>
  <li>your vehicle isn’t roadworthy</li>
  <li>your vehicle is overloaded</li>
  <li>you’ve been given a fixed penalty notice but can’t or won’t pay a financial penalty deposit</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all vehicles given an immediate prohibition will be immobilised. Special circumstances will be considered, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of load you’re carrying</li>
  <li>if you’re carrying passengers on a public service vehicle who’d be inconvenienced if it was immobilised</li>
</ul>
<h2>How your vehicle is immobilised</h2>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> and the police use a steel cable secured by a padlock to immobilise vehicles. It’s fitted around the wheels of the vehicle and a warning notice is attached to the vehicle.</p>

<p>The notice tells you how to get the vehicle released. You have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>satisfy <abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> that the causes of the immediate prohibitions have been dealt with </li>
  <li>pay an £80 release charge </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>It’s an offence to remove the warning notice or interfere with the immobilising device.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr> has produced a guide to vehicle immobilisation with more information, including advice on how to avoid it.</p>
