<h2>The UK and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>As a member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, the UK follows various laws setting out the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s powers and how it can use them.</p>

<p>UK government ministers take part in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> discussions and decision-making, and final decisions are made jointly by all member countries. </p>

<p>There’s more information about <a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/" title="the UK's role in the EU">the UK’s role in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a> on the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website.</p>

<h2>The Council of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This is the main decision-making part of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. It’s sometimes also called the Council of Ministers and approves European laws jointly with the <a href="the-european-parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>. </p>

<p>Presidency of the council rotates every 6 months from one member country to the next. The country holding the presidency takes charge of all the meetings.</p>

<p>Meetings are attended by the relevant minister from each country - so if health matters are being discussed, the UK Secretary of State for Health will attend.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The UK last held presidency of the Council of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> from July to December 2005.</p>
</div>

<h2>The European Council</h2>

<p>This isn’t the same as the Council of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. It meets 4 times a year and sets the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s overall priorities. </p>

<p>It’s made up of the leaders of each member country and the President of the European Commission.  </p>

<h2>The European Commission</h2>

<p>This is similar to the UK civil service and puts into practice the agenda set by the European Council. It drafts new laws and makes sure member countries follow them. </p>

<p>Every member country nominates 1 Commissioner, responsible for a specific policy area eg education or transport. They’re independent of their countries and serve the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as a whole.</p>

<h2>The European Courts</h2>

<p>Each member country sends a judge to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The court makes sure that European laws are interpreted and applied in the right way. </p>

<p>The Court of Auditors also has 1 representative from each member country. It reviews the accounts of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>


</article><article id="nato"><header><h1>Part 3: Nato</h1>
  </header><p><abbr title="the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">Nato</abbr> (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) is an alliance of 28 countries from Europe and North America. </p>

</div>

<h2>How <abbr title="the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">Nato</abbr> works</h2>

<p>Each <abbr title="the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">Nato</abbr> decision must be agreed by every member country. This means all decisions have the full backing of member countries.</p>

<p><abbr title="the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation">Nato</abbr>’s most important decision-making body is the North Atlantic Council. Every member country sits on this. </p>
