<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Personal computer systems, computer servers, laptops and portables (and parts and accessories for these machines) are covered in Chapter 84 and Chapter 85 of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff). These two chapters together make up Section XVI of the Tariff and cover between them a wide range of mechanical, electrical, electronic and other machinery. </p>

<p>This guide will help you to classify computers - including complete systems, individual separate units, parts and accessories - and computer software correctly according to:</p>

<ul>
<li>their function</li>
  <li>their design, build and performance</li>
  <li>whether they’ve got more than one function, including functions unrelated to computers</li>
  <li>whether they’re part of a complete system or an individual separate unit</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quick-reference-table-of-heading-codes">Quick reference table of heading codes</h2>

<p>The following list isn’t exhaustive, but it’ll help you check quickly whether or not a particular item of computer hardware or software is likely to be covered in chapters 84 or 85 and tell you the heading code you need.</p>

<h3 id="general-interpretative-rules-for-classification-of-computers-and-software">General Interpretative Rules for classification of computers and software</h3>

<p>The General Interpretative Rules (<abbr title="General Interpretative Rules">GIRs</abbr>) of the Tariff provide the legal basis for classifying goods. There are six <abbr title="General Interpretative Rules">GIRs</abbr>, which are set out in Part 1 Section I of the second volume of the Tariff.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 1 directs that:</p>

<p>“For legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.”</p>

<p>A heading code is a four-digit code, while a chapter code is a two-digit code. The terms of the heading descriptions - and the notes to each section and chapter - are paramount when it comes to classifying goods correctly.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 6 determines how goods are classified at the level of a subheading code - a code with six or more digits. So if an item is classified using a code of six or more digits, both <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 6 and <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 1 will always apply.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 2, <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3 and <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 4 sometimes also apply, depending on the nature of the goods to be classified. It’s important to note that you must consider each <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> in sequence. For example, you can’t use <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3c to classify goods until you have tried using <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 2a, <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 2b, <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3a and <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3b.</p>

<p><abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 5 applies to certain types of container and to packing materials presented with the items they’re designed to package.</p>

<p>Guidance notes on interpreting each <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> are included in the <a href="/specialist/classification-of-goods" title="Harmonised System Explanatory Notes to the Tariff">Harmonised System Explanatory Notes to the Tariff.</a></p>

<h2 id="classifying-complete-computers">Classifying complete computers</h2>

<p>Items that are classified under heading code 8471 as ‘automatic data processing machines’ - computers - are machines that must be capable of all the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>storing the processing programs that run on them - and at least the data that’s needed to run a program</li>
  <li>being freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user</li>
  <li>performing arithmetical computations specified by the user</li>
  <li>executing, without human intervention, a processing program for which they need to modify their execution by making logical decisions throughout the process</li>
</ul>
<p>Note 5a to Chapter 84 defines the term ‘automatic data processing machine’ for the purposes of heading code 8471. Essentially, goods that are classified as computers must be able to use standard operating software and to perform functions like word processing and spreadsheet applications. They must incorporate a hard disk drive.</p>

<p>A computer may take the form of a system made up of several separate units, eg a keyboard, monitor, base unit and so on. With some exceptions, a unit is treated as part of a computer system if it meets all of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>it’s of a type solely or principally used in a computer system</li>
  <li>it can be connected to the central processing unit (<abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr>) either directly or through one or more other units</li>
  <li>it can accept or deliver data in a form usable by the system, such as codes or signals</li>
</ul>
<p>Keyboards, X-Y co-ordinate input devices like joysticks and mouse devices, and disk storage units only need to meet the last two conditions.</p>

<h3 id="desktop-and-tower-systems">Desktop and tower systems</h3>

<p>Standard desktop and tower systems must have at least:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr> - the base unit or ‘system box’</li>
  <li>an input unit - for example a keyboard</li>
  <li>an output unit - for example a monitor</li>
</ul>
<p>They can also include other units like printers and scanners. Built in ‘extras’ such as network cards and television cards are also treated as part of the system. Desktop and tower computer systems are classified under subheading code 8471 49 00 90.</p>

<h3 id="servers">Servers</h3>

<p>Network file servers that have both a keyboard and a monitor are, like desktop computer systems, classified under subheading code 8471 49 00 90.</p>

<p>Network file servers that don’t have both a keyboard and a monitor are classified as individual separate units. The base unit itself is classified under subheading code 8471 50 00 90. If a monitor is present (D-sub 15-pin only - not video), then that would be classified separately under subheading code 8528 51 00 00, while a keyboard would be classified separately under subheading code 8471 60 60 90.</p>

<p>Printer servers and firewall systems aren’t treated as computer servers, but as data communication apparatus. They’re classified under subheading code 8517 62 00 90.</p>

<h3 id="small-portable-computers">Small portable computers</h3>

<p>These include laptop and notebook computers and personal digital assistants with similar capabilities to laptops. To be classified under subheading code 8471 30 00 00 they must weigh less than 10 kilograms and have at least:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a keyboard</li>
  <li>a display</li>
  <li>a means of loading programs</li>
</ul>
<p>To classify a portable computer correctly, please also refer to the following item descriptions.</p>

<h3 id="palm-held-portables">Palm-held portables</h3>

<p>These are electronic personal organisers that don’t usually have a full keyboard. They generally have pre-defined functions like a diary and an address book. They’re classified under subheading code 8543 70 90 99.</p>

<h3 id="other-portable-computers">Other portable computers</h3>

<p>Portable computers that don’t meet the above requirements can include touch screen, luggable and industrial computers. There’s no maximum weight, but they must include at least the following within the same housing:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an input unit</li>
  <li>an output unit</li>

</ul>
<p>Although they can display television pictures, they don’t include a television tuner. These types of dual purpose monitor are often known as video monitors. <abbr title="cathode ray tube">CRT</abbr> colour monitors are classified under subheading code 8528 49 35 90.</p>

<h3 id="plasma-lcd-and-other-flat-panel-display-monitors">Plasma, <abbr title="liquid crystal display">LCD</abbr> and other flat panel display monitors</h3>

<p>It is necessary to decide whether an <abbr title="liquid crystal display">LCD</abbr> monitor is classified as a computer monitor under subheading code 8528 51 00 90, or as an ‘other’ monitor under subheading 8528 59 90. To do this, an overall assessment of the monitor is necessary to take into account the functions performed by the monitor as well as the degree of performance of those functions. This assessment may take into account the connectors present and other features such as aspect ratio or screen size.  </p>

<p><abbr title="liquid crystal display">LCD</abbr> monitors that include a television tuner are classified under subheading code 8528 72 91 00 if they have got a standard aspect ratio (4:3) and under subheading code 8528 72 99 00 if they have got a wide-screen aspect ratio (16:9).</p>

Examples of the types of specific function that these machines might perform include communication, measuring, checking and control. These function-specific machines may operate on fixed programs and aren’t freely programmable.</p>

<p>These types of machine aren’t classified under heading code 8471, but under the heading code that’s appropriate to the function they perform. If there’s no appropriate heading code, then they’re classified under a residual heading code.</p>

<p>Note 5e to chapter 84 sets out the legal basis for classifying machines with a specific function that aren’t computers.</p>

<p>This classification guidance also applies to goods that only operate when they’re connected to the central processing unit of a computer - for example a modem or television tuner card.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-computer-parts-and-accessories">Classifying computer parts and accessories</h2>

<p>A ‘computer part’ is an integral component of a computer. Various computer parts are classified as separate units if they don’t make up part of a complete computer system.</p>

<p>A ‘computer accessory’ gives a computer an additional function, but isn’t an integral component. It’s an interchangeable part or device that’s designed to adapt a machine to:</p>

<ul>
<li>do a particular operation</li>
  <li>perform a particular service</li>
  <li>increase its range of operations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classifying-computer-parts">Classifying computer parts</h3>

<p>Note 2 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying computer parts.</p>

<p>Many integral computer parts are classified under heading code 8473.</p>

<p>A part that’s an integral part of a computer, but is specifically covered by a heading code in chapter 84 or chapter 85, is classified under that heading code. For example, because coaxial cable is specifically covered by heading code 8544, it’s classified under this heading and not as a computer part under heading code 8473. However, there are certain heading codes to which this rule doesn’t apply because they’re designated parts headings. They’re listed in Note 2a to Section XVI and are:</p>

<ul>
<li>8409</li>
  <li>8431</li>
  <li>8448</li>
  <li>8466</li>
  <li>8473</li>
  <li>8487</li>
  <li>8503</li>
  <li>8522</li>
  <li>8529</li>
  <li>8538</li>
  <li>8548</li>
</ul>
<p>Some parts are suitable for use solely or principally with a particular kind of machine - or with a number of machines classified under the same heading code - but aren’t specifically covered by a heading code in chapter 84 or chapter 85. These are classified either under one of the heading codes listed above or under the same heading code as the machine or machines that they’re suitable for.</p>

<p>Parts that are equally suitable for use solely or principally with goods classified under heading code 8517, and under heading codes 8525 to 8528, are always classified under heading code 8517. This rule is set out in Note 2b to Section XVI.</p>

<p>Any other parts that are suitable for use with a number of machines classified under different heading codes are classified, as appropriate, under one of the following heading codes:</p>

<ul>
<li>8409</li>
  <li>8431</li>
  <li>8448</li>
  <li>8466</li>
  <li>8473</li>
  <li>8503</li>
  <li>8522</li>
  <li>8529</li>
  <li>8538</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above heading codes is suitable, they’re classified under heading code 8487 or 8548. This rule is set out in Note 2c to Section XVI.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-computer-accessories">Classifying computer accessories</h2>

<p>Many computer accessories are classified under heading code 8473, which deals specifically with parts and accessories for machines that include computers. Only a few heading codes in chapter 84 and chapter 85 cover computer accessories. If the item, or items, for which the accessories are intended is classified under a heading code that doesn’t cover accessories, then the accessories themselves are classified elsewhere in the Tariff according to their function or constituent material.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-software">Classifying software</h2>

<p>Software classification depends on the media on which it’s been recorded and the nature of the software. Media include:</p>

<ul>
<li>CD, DVD, Laserdisc, Minidisc and other laser-read disks. Even though there are differences in the manufacturing and recording - or writing - processes, these are all designed to be read by some kind of laser system once recorded.</li>
  <li>floppy disk</li>
  <li>magnetic tape</li>
  <li>magnetic stripe cards</li>
  <li>memory cards</li>
  <li>cartridges for video games consoles</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of Tariff classification, software categories include:</p>

<ul>
<li>programs and data</li>
  <li>sound recordings</li>
  <li>computer games</li>
  <li>films, pictures and image files</li>
  <li>games for video games consoles</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programs-and-data">Programs and data</h3>

<p>These include word processing programs, spreadsheets, desktop publishing programs, painting or drawing programs, route planners, encyclopaedia, business or phone directories, catalogues, device drivers, system boot-disks and backup disks. Programs and data are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:</p>

<ul>
<li>CD, DVD, Laserdisc, Minidisc or other laser-read disks then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 45 00</li>
  <li>magnetic tape then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 33 00</li>
  <li>floppy disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 31 00</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sound-recordings">Sound recordings</h3>

<p>These include music disks, language courses, wildlife recordings, train enthusiasts’ sound bites, talking books and so on. Sound recordings are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minidisc then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 31 00</li>
  <li>any other laser-read disk - for example CD, SACD or DVD - then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 39 00</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="computer-games">Computer games</h3>

<p>These include flight simulators, ‘shoot ‘em ups’, sports games, car racing games, strategy games and so on for use only on an automatic data processing machine (computer). Computer games are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:</p>

<ul>
<li>CD, DVD, Laserdisc, Minidisc or other laser-read disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 45 00.</li>
  <li>floppy disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 33 00.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="films-pictures-and-image-files">Films, pictures and image files</h3>

<p>These include movies, videos, photo CDs, clip art collections, photo collections and karaoke disks. Films, pictures and image files are classified according to the media they’re recorded on. If they’re recorded on:</p>

<ul>
<li>DVD then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 51 00</li>
  <li>any other laser-read disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 59 00</li>
  <li>floppy disk then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 29 33 00</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="games-for-video-games-consoles">Games for video games consoles</h3>

<p>These are classified according to the media on which they’re recorded. If they’re recorded on:</p>

<ul>
<li>DVD, then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 51 00</li>
  <li>any other laser-read disk, then they’re classified under subheading code 8523 40 59 00</li>
  <li>cartridges, then they’re classified along with games consoles in chapter 95 under subheading code 9504 10 00 00</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software-on-memory-cards-and-magnetic-stripe-cards">Software on memory cards and magnetic stripe cards</h3>

<p>Software that’s recorded onto a memory card - for example Compact Flash, Smart Media, Secure Digital (SD), Multimedia Card (MMC), Memory Stick, XD Picture Card, PC Card or PCMCIA Card - is classified under subheading code 8523 51 93 00.</p>

<p>Software that’s recorded onto a magnetic stripe card is classified under subheading code 8523 21 00 00.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-blank-media">Classifying blank media</h2>

<p>Blank media include:</p>

<ul>
<li>CD, DVD, Minidisc and other laser-read disks</li>
  <li>flash memory cards</li>
  <li>magnetic tapes and disks</li>
  <li>removable hard disks</li>
  <li>micro drives</li>
  <li>floppy disks, floppy disk cookie only and super floppy disks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cd-dvd-minidisc-and-other-laser-read-disks">CD, DVD, Minidisc and other laser-read disks</h3>

<p>Classification of blank unrecorded disks can be complicated. Although all of these types of disk are read by laser systems, the recording (writing) systems differ. The disks fall into the following classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>CD-R disks. These are unrecorded blank disks of ‘Orange Book II’ type that use laser technology for both reading and writing. Orange Book II is the second part of a standard developed by Sony and Philips to define the construction of multisession CDs. CD-R disks are classified under subheading code 8523 40 11 00.</li>
  <li>CD-RW disks. These use Phase-change technology for recording and erasing and are classified under subheading code 8523 40 19 00.</li>
  <li>Blank Minidiscs. These use magnetic optical technology for recording and erasing. They’ve got a magnetic layer and are rigid magnetic disks. Blank Minidiscs are classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.</li>
  <li>Other blank magneto-optical disks. These are classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.</li>
  <li>DVD-R disks. The technology of these disks is assumed to be similar to the CD-R disk in that they use laser technology for both reading and writing. DVD-R disks are classified under subheading code 8523 40 13 00.</li>
  <li>DVD+RW discs. These use the Phase-change technology for recording and erasing and are classified under subheading code 8523 40 19 00.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flash-memory-cards">Flash memory cards</h3>

<p>These cards contain two or more flash memory integrated electronic circuits mounted on a base. There are different types of flash memory card, including Compact Flash, Smart Media, Secure Digital (SD), Multimedia Card (MMC), Memory Stick, XD Picture Card, PC Card and PCMCIA Card. Flash memory cards are classified under subheading code 8523 51 10 00.</p>

<h3 id="magnetic-tapes-and-disks">Magnetic tapes and disks</h3>

<p>These include compact cassettes, VHS and mini-DV and are classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.</p>

<h3 id="removable-hard-disks---disk-only-not-the-complete-drive">Removable hard disks - disk only, not the complete drive</h3>

<p>This type of disk is usually supplied with some software utilities pre-loaded, so it’s classified as recorded software under subheading code 8523 80 10 00.</p>

<h3 id="micro-drives">Micro drives</h3>

<p>These are miniature hard disk drives for use in a PC card or similar slot. They’re classified under subheading code 8471 70 50 90.</p>

<h3 id="floppy-disks">Floppy disks</h3>

<p>These include standard floppy disks, floppy disk cookie only and super floppy disks - for example the LS120 type. They’re all classified under subheading code 8523 29 15 00.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty-with-classification">Difficulty with classification</h2>

<p>Section XVI of the Tariff, which includes chapter 84 and chapter 85, includes detailed notes covering the goods classified in these chapters. Both chapters also include their own classification notes. When classifying goods in these chapters, you should refer to the notes and decide which, if any, apply.</p>

<h3 id="general-interpretative-rules-girs">General Interpretative Rules (<abbr title="General Interpretative Rules">GIRs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="General Interpretative Rules">GIRs</abbr> in section 1 of the Tariff set out principles for classifying goods. When classifying computers and software, certain <abbr title="General Interpretative Rules">GIRs</abbr> may have particular relevance for goods like dual purpose and composite goods (<abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 1), and specially made carrying cases and packaging materials (<abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 5).</p>

<ul>
<li>Note 5 to Section XVI defines the term ‘machine’ for the purposes of the Tariff. In this guide, a “machine” means any machinery, plant, equipment, apparatus or appliance referred to in the heading codes within chapter 84 and chapter 85.</li>
  <li>Note 5 to chapter 84 defines and describes “automatic data processing machines” - computers - for the purposes of the Tariff. Note 5 also sets out rules for classifying separate individual units of computer systems correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="composite-goods">Composite goods</h3>

<p>Some goods consist of several machines fitted together to form a single whole. To classify composite goods like this correctly, first try to establish which machine performs the main function. Then classify the whole item under the heading code for the machine that performs this main function.</p>

<p>If it’s not possible to establish which machine in a composite item performs the main function, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3c. According to this rule, of all the possible heading codes or subheading codes that could equally apply, the code that comes last in numerical order is used to classify the goods. <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3c is set out in Part 1 Section I of the second volume of the Tariff.</p>

<p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying composite goods.</p>

<h3 id="multifunctional-goods">Multifunctional goods</h3>

<p>Multifunctional goods are machines that are designed to perform two or more complementary or alternative functions.</p>

<p>To classify a multifunctional machine correctly, first try to establish which is the machine’s main function. If this is possible, the goods are classified under the heading code or subheading code appropriate to that function - as if that were the machine’s only function.</p>

<p>If it’s not possible to establish which is the main function, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title="General Interpretative Rule">GIR</abbr> 3c as outlined above.</p>

<p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying multifunctional goods.</p>

<h3 id="individual-components-that-work-together-to-perform-a-single-function">Individual components that work together to perform a single function</h3>

<p>Some machines consist of a series of individual components that are intended to contribute together to a clearly defined function covered by one of the heading codes in chapter 84 or chapter 85. The components can be separate or connected by any means such as cables or wireless devices.</p>

<p>If a machine matches this description, then the whole machine is classified under the heading code that’s appropriate to the function it performs.</p>

<p>Note 4 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying single function goods made up of several components.</p>

<h3 id="magnetic-and-optical-data-readers-writers-and-processors">Magnetic and optical data readers, writers and processors</h3>

<p>Heading code 8471 includes “magnetic or optical readers, machines for transcribing data onto data media in coded form and machines for processing such data, not elsewhere specified or included”. These products aren’t automatic data processing machines and nor are they units of them, so they don’t have to meet the classification definition of a computer or a computer part. They’re classified under subheading code 8471 90.</p>

<h2 id="exclusions-and-exceptions-from-chapters-84-and-85">Exclusions and exceptions from chapters 84 and 85</h2>

<p>The following items aren’t covered in either chapter 84 or chapter 85, even though they may share some characteristics with, or be in some way associated with, certain items of computer hardware or software:</p>

<ol>
<li>Certain machines which share some or all of the characteristics of a computer system, but which perform a specific function like measuring, checking, controlling or medical tasks. These types of machine are classified in other chapters under heading codes that are appropriate to their specific function, or under residual heading codes.</li>
  <li>Inkjet cartridges without a print head are classified in chapter 39 under subheading code 3923 90 90 00 if they’re empty, and in chapter 32 under subheading code 3215 90 80 10 if they’ve been refilled. Cartridges with a ‘chip’ to measure the ink level are also classified under subheading code 3215 90 80 10.</li>
  <li>Typewriter ribbons and other similar ribbons. These can be on spools or in cartridges and are classified according to what they’re made of. If they’ve been inked or prepared in some other way for printing they are classified in chapter 96 under heading code 9612.</li>
  <li>Non-electric projection screens are classified in chapter 90 under subheading code 9010 60 00 00.</li>
  <li>Toys and games, including video games consoles and video game cartridges. Toys and games are covered in chapter 95. (Computer games software for use only on computers, and games software for video games consoles on laser-read disks like CDs and DVDs are, however, covered in chapter 85 under heading code 8523.)</li>
  <li>Clocks and watches are covered in chapter 91. (Mechanical display watches with a built-in flash memory device are, however, classified in chapter 85 under subheading code 8523 90 90.)</li>
  <li>Non-digital (photographic film) cameras are covered in chapter 90.</li>
  <li>Computer monitor optical screen filters are covered in chapter 90.</li>
  <li>Parts for vehicles, aircraft and other transport equipment, which are covered in Section XVII. There are special codes for equipment that’s for use in a civil aircraft.</li>
  <li>Basic parts for general use. These could, for example, be made of base metal (like steel screws and bolts, which are covered in chapter 73) or made of plastics (like plastic trunking, which is covered in chapter 39).</li>
  <li>More information about the special heading codes for equipment used in civil aircraft is available in Part 11 of Volume 1 of the Tariff at paragraph 11 2 8 or from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Tariff Classification Service Enquiry Line on Tel 01702 366 077.</li>
