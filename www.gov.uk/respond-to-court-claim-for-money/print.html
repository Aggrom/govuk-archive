  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>If you get a form from the court claiming that you owe someone money, don’t ignore it.</p>

<p>If you don’t reply, or miss the deadline, you may end up paying more, and you could get a <a href="/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/" title="county court judgment">county court judgment</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must respond within 14 days of receiving the form.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to respond</h2>

<p>You can respond by filling in court forms, or using <a href="http://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/web/mcol/welcome%20%E2%80%9CMoney%20Claim%20Online%E2%80%9D" rel="external">Money Claim Online,</a> if the claim was made online.</p>

<p>The login details will be on the claim form sent by the court.</p>

<h2>Ask for more time to respond</h2>

<p>If you need more time, you can ask for another 14 days to respond.</p>

<p>To do this, fill in the acknowledgment of service form in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=647" title="response pack">response pack,</a> and return it to the court.</p>

<p>This will show that you’re looking at the claim, not ignoring it, and will give you a total of 28 days to reply.</p>

<h2>Court claims in Scotland</h2>

<p>The law is different in Scotland - see guidance from the Accountant in Bankruptcy (Scotland’s insolvency service).</p>

</div>

</article><article id="pay-the-money"><header><h1>Part 2: Pay the money</h1>
  </header><p>To pay the money, send a cheque or postal order or take the money to the address on the claim form.</p>

<p>Make sure you pay within the deadline and get a receipt, to prove you’ve paid.</p>

<h2>Offer to pay</h2>

<p>If you can’t afford to pay the money in a lump sum, you can offer to pay in instalments or by a given date:</p>

<ul>
<li>fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=657" title="admission form">admission form</a>
</li>
  <li>say on the form how you want to pay - eg by a certain amount per month</li>
  <li>send the form to the address on the claim form</li>
</ul>
<p>If the other person or business accepts your offer, keep up with the payments. If you don’t, you could be taken back to court and asked to pay more costs.</p>

<h2>If you’ve already paid</h2>

<p>If you’ve already paid the money, fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659" title="defence form">defence form</a> and send it back to the court.</p>

</div>

</article><article id="admit-owing-some-of-the-money"><header><h1>Part 3: Admit owing some of the money</h1>
  </header><p>If you owe some of the money, but don’t agree with the amount, you need to fill in 2 forms and return them to the court:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=657" title="admission form">admission form</a> - saying what you owe</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659" title="defence form">defence form</a> - saying what you don’t owe</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain what you owe and why you don’t owe any more.</p>

<p>You can use <a rel="external" href="http://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/web/mcol/welcome/" title="Money Claim Online">Money Claim Online</a> if the claim was made online - this will be quicker than posting the forms.</p>

<h2>Paying what you owe</h2>

<p>If you want to pay what you owe, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay the amount you owe straight away</li>
  <li>offer to pay in instalments</li>
  <li>offer to pay by a certain date</li>
</ul>
<h2>If your offer is rejected</h2>

<p>If your offer is rejected, the court will decide how much you owe. </p>

<p>The court may ask you for more information, and will send you a letter if you have to go to a court hearing.</p>

</article><article id="deny-owing-the-money"><header><h1>Part 4: Deny owing the money</h1>
  </header><p>If you don’t owe the other person or business money, you can defend the claim.</p>

<p>Fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659" title="defence/counterclaim form">defence/counterclaim form</a> and return it to the court.</p>

<p>Alternatively, use <a rel="external" href="http://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/web/mcol/welcome/" title="Money Claim Online">Money Claim Online,</a> if the claim was made online.</p>

<h2>After you reply</h2>

<p>The court will decide if you owe the money.</p>

<p>It may ask you for more information, and will send you a letter if you have to go to a court hearing.</p>

<h2>If the other person or business owes you money</h2>

<p>If you think the other person or business owes you money, you can defend yourself and make a claim against them. This is known as making a ‘counterclaim’.</p>

<p>Fill in the <a rel="external" href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659" title="defence/counterclaim form">defence/counterclaim form</a> or use <a rel="external" href="http://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/web/mcol/welcome/" title="Money Claim Online">Money Claim Online.</a></p>

<p>You may have to pay a <a href="/make-court-claim-for-money/court-fees/" title="court fees">court fee</a>.</p>

</article><article id="going-to-a-court-hearing"><header><h1>Part 5: Going to a court hearing</h1>
  </header><p>You may have to go to court if you don’t owe the money, and you defend the case.</p>

<h2>Small claims</h2>

<p>If your case is a small claim - under £5,000 - it may be dealt with using written evidence, without a hearing.</p>

<p>If there is a hearing, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>represent yourself</li>
  <li>ask someone to speak on your behalf, like your partner or an advice worker - you must get the court’s permission</li>
  <li>pay for a solicitor to represent you</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Small claims hearings can be held in the judge’s room or a court-room at the your local county court.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cases over £5,000</h2>

<p>If the other person says you owe more than £5,000, there may be a more formal hearing, and you should get legal advice.</p>

<h2>After the hearing</h2>

<p>The court will send you a letter giving you its decision.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the decision, you have 21 days from the date of the decision to appeal. The letter will explain how to do this.</p>
