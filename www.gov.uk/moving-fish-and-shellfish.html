<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Introducing fish and shellfish to the wrong type of environment can lead to the spread of fish diseases, damage to fisheries and the wider environment. </p>

<p>You don’t need special licences or permission for moving between authorised fish farms, but you must observe certain conditions. Any movements to and from any other inland waters need consent from the Environment Agency before they can be made.</p>

<p>You also have legal responsibilities when you transport live fish. These include a number of biosecurity measures designed to prevent disease being spread, as well as record keeping requirements when fish are transported.</p>

<h3 id="regulating-the-transport-of-fish-and-shellfish">Regulating the transport of fish and shellfish</h3>

<p>The Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>) and the Environment Agency work to prevent damage caused by fish and shellfish movements in England and Wales. The role of the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>authorising fish farms</li>
  <li>registering fisheries</li>
  <li>regulating movements between authorised fish farm sites</li>
  <li>controlling fish movements in areas where a notifiable disease is suspected or confirmed</li>
</ul>
<p>The Environment Agency regulates the introduction and removal of fish and crustacea within inland waters in England and Wales.</p>

<h3 id="additional-controls-on-non-native-fish-movements">Additional controls on non-native fish movements</h3>

<p>Movements of non-native fish are further controlled under two separate pieces of legislation and require a specific licence known as an ILFA (Import of Live Fish Act) licence. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/non-native-fish">non-native fish</a>.</p>

<h2 id="movements-between-aquaculture-production-businesses">Movements between aquaculture production businesses</h2>

<p>All UK aquaculture production businesses (fish and shellfish farms) need to be authorised - see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/fish-and-shellfish-farm-authorisation-and-registration">fish and shellfish farm authorisation and registration</a>. You can make movements of live fish and shellfish between authorised farms without a licence and prior consent. However, both the supplier and the receiver must record details of the movements and make them available to the Fish Health Inspectorate.</p>

<h3 id="other-movement-conditions">Other movement conditions</h3>

<p>At the time you sell or transport fish, eggs or gametes they must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>show any clinical signs of disease</li>
  <li>be planned for destruction under an official scheme to eradicate disease</li>
  <li>come from a farm that’s subject to statutory disease control</li>
</ul>
<p>If you move fish or shellfish to other inland waters, you must get consent from the Environment Agency.</p>

<h3 id="movements-and-sale-of-dead-fish-from-authorised-farms">Movements and sale of dead fish from authorised farms</h3>

<p>Although there are normally no restrictions on moving and selling dead fish from your farm, you must still follow rules designed to protect public health. </p>

<p>If your farm is subject to statutory disease control then you may have to comply with some further conditions, like removing the internal organs of the fish - ‘evisceration’. The <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will be able to give you further advice regarding statutory disease control - call the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> Helpline on 01305 206 700.</p>

<h2 id="fish-movements-into-inland-waters">Fish movements into inland waters</h2>

<p>Fish stocking is an important tool in managing your fishery, but if not done properly can put your fishery at risk. So it is very important that you know the long term goals for your fishery and what you can realistically achieve.</p>

<p>When stocking a river or stillwater fishery with any fish, crayfish, fry or ova you must get written consent from the Environment Agency. This is known as ‘Section 30 consent’ and is a legal requirement. The Environment Agency issues you with Section 30 consent for a specific date or dates, fishery and consignment of fish. However, this requirement does not apply to movements of fish onto authorised fish farms.</p>

<h3 id="registering-your-stillwater">Registering your stillwater</h3>

<p>Before you can apply for Section 30 consent you must register your stillwater with the Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>). This is a free one-off procedure designed to maintain the high health quality of fish in England and Wales. For information about registration requirements and the forms you need to fill in, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/fish-and-shellfish-farm-authorisation-and-registration">fish and shellfish farm authorisation and registration</a>.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-section-30-consent">Applying for Section 30 consent</h3>

<p>After your fishery has been registered, you must apply for Section 30 consent using application form FR1. You can <a rel="external" href="https://forms.efishbusiness.co.uk">apply online using the live fish movements ‘E-consenting’ tool on the eFishBusiness website (registration required)</a>. You can also apply by sending form FR1 to the Environment Agency Fish Movements Team. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-FR1.pdf">download Environment Agency form FR1 from the Aquatic Animal Health and Movements (<abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr>) website (PDF, 298K)</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to provide details of the species that you are introducing and the name of the water or fish farm that they are coming from. This information enables the Environment Agency to establish if there are any risks to the fishery or the wider environment.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-does-the-application-process-take">How long does the application process take?</h3>

<p>You should allow at least ten working days for your application to be processed, but it may take longer if:</p>

<ul>
<li>a fish health check is required - you can find out about fish health checks in our guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/section-30-fish-health-checks">Section 30 fish health checks</a>
</li>
  <li>the conservation status of the receiving water means that the Environment Agency needs to consult with other organisations such as Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-native-fish">Non-native fish</h3>

<p>If you intend to introduce non-native fish to your fishery, you will also need an ILFA (Import of Live Fish Act) licence from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Defra can take up to two months to process your application. You need to get this licence before you apply for Section 30 consents to move non-native fish. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/non-native-fish">non-native fish</a>.</p>

<h3 id="penalties-for-moving-fish-without-section-30-consent">Penalties for moving fish without Section 30 consent</h3>

<p>Without written Section 30 consent, it’s against the law to:</p>

<ul>
<li>introduce any fish or spawn of fish into an inland water</li>
  <li>be in possession of any fish or spawn of fish intended to be introduced into an inland water</li>
</ul>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you do so, you might be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £2,500 and a criminal record.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="your-responsibilities-when-transporting-fish">Your responsibilities when transporting fish</h2>

<p>There are two main pieces of legislation that safeguard the welfare of live fish when they are being transported:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 2009</li>
  <li>the Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005</li>
  <li>the Aquatic Animal Health (England and Wales) Regulations 2009</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the transporter’s responsibility to comply with the regulations. For journeys of 65 kilometres (40 miles) or more, the transporter also needs to be authorised.</p>

<p>You must take steps to minimise the risk of spreading disease to the fish you are transporting, to any fish along your journey route and at the final destination. You should also make sure that the length of the journey is as short as reasonably possible.</p>

<h3 id="cleaning-and-disinfecting-fish-transport-equipment">Cleaning and disinfecting fish transport equipment</h3>

<p>You must make sure that all equipment is cleaned and disinfected before it’s used. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>vehicles</li>
  <li>tanks</li>
  <li>equipment like nets that will come into contact with the fish or the water they are in</li>
</ul>
<p>There are commercial disinfectants available that are suitable for use on fish transport equipment. Before disinfecting, all equipment must be thoroughly cleaned of dirt or the disinfectant may not work.</p>

<p>If you visit a number of different sites on your journey, the vehicle and nets should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between sites.</p>

<h3 id="carrying-fish-in-water">Carrying fish in water</h3>

<p>Water can carry organisms that cause diseases in fish. To prevent diseases spreading, the water that you use to transport fish must come from either:</p>

<ul>
<li>the same source as the fish</li>
  <li>a safe source, such as a borehole supply</li>
</ul>
<p>You should not empty the transport water into a receiving fishery unless it’s from a safe source.</p>

<p>During transport, you must make sure water can’t escape and you should only carry out a change of water at an approved water station.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-transport-your-fish">How to transport your fish</h3>

<p>The best way to transport fish is in purpose-built tanks, in water from the site and with adequate aeration. If this isn’t possible, you can use plastic leak-proof bags instead. For information on transporting fish in bags, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Guide-Health-Checks.pdf">download guidance on bagging and transporting live fish from the Aquatic Animal Health and Movements (<abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr>) website (PDF, 121K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="record-keeping-requirements">Record keeping requirements</h3>

<p>The transporter must complete an Animal Transport Certificate for every journey where live fish are transported.</p>

<p>They must also keep a record of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of fish that die during transportation</li>
  <li>all the authorised farms and/or registered fisheries visited during the transportation</li>
  <li>all exchanges of water made during the journey, including the source of the water and where it was discharged</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep a record of all this information, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Book-Transport.pdf">download the Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>) transport log from the <abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr> website (PDF, 183K)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="removing-fish-from-inland-waters">Removing fish from inland waters</h2>

<p>All inland waters, excluding rivers and canals, from which fish or crayfish are removed must be registered with the Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>). There are two types of registration depending on the type of water:</p>

<ul>
<li>fishery registration</li>
  <li>registration of low risk cropping and harvesting waters that supply fish, but which are not fisheries</li>
</ul>
<p>For information about registration requirements and the forms you need to fill in, see our guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/fish-and-shellfish-farm-authorisation-and-registration">fish and shellfish farm authorisation and registration</a>.</p>

<h3 id="removing-live-fish">Removing live fish</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency regulates the movement of fish and crayfish within all inland waters in England and Wales. They aim to prevent the spread of fish disease and to minimise damage to fisheries and the environment caused by inappropriate fish introductions.</p>

<p>You must get written permission from the Environment Agency to be able to use fishing instruments - other than a rod and line - to remove fish and crayfish from inland waters. This written permission is often referred to as ‘byelaw consent’ and is usually issued for a specific date, site and particular species.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>It’s an offence to remove any fish with an instrument other than a rod or line without having written permission from the Environment Agency, and you could face prosecution for doing so.</p>
</div>

<p>If your fishery isn’t registered with the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>, the Environment Agency will not issue byelaw consent. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/forms/forms-list/">Download the registration forms</a>.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-byelaw-consent">Applying for byelaw consent</h3>

<p>Applying for byelaw consent is straightforward - you just need to complete form FR2. You can <a rel="external" href="https://forms.efishbusiness.co.uk">apply online using the live fish movements ‘E-consenting’ tool on the eFishBusiness website (registration required)</a>. If you prefer you can send a completed form FR2 to the Environment Agency Fish Movements Team. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Form-FR2.pdf">Download <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> form FR2 from the Aquatic Animal Health and Movements (<abbr title="Aquatic Animal Health and Movements">AAHM</abbr>) website (PDF, 298K)</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to provide details of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the species that are being removed</li>
  <li>the nature of the task and the instruments you are planning to use</li>
  <li>the name of the water the fish are being removed from</li>
</ul>
<p>This information enables the Environment Agency to establish if there are any risks to the fishery or the wider environment. They will generally process your application within ten working days, but may be longer if the water the fish are being removed from has conservation status. This would require the Environment Agency to consult with other organisations such as Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales.</p>
