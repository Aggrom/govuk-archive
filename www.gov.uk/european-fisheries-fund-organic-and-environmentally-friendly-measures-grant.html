<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The European Fisheries Fund (<abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>) provides grant funding for aquaculture businesses that are planning to introduce organic or environmentally friendly measures. Grants are only available to businesses under a certain size and cover only eligible costs. Micro, small and medium-sized businesses can get funding to cover up to 100% of eligible costs. Other applicants can receive up to 80%.</p>

<p>When you apply for a grant under the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, you need to write a detailed business plan and may need to include an environmental impact assessment as well. If your application is successful, you then have to meet certain conditions and targets or the grant won’t be paid.</p>

<p>This guide sets out the rules for organic aquaculture classification and the specific conditions required for environmentally friendly projects. It also explains who can get grant aid, how to apply and how much you will receive if your application is successful.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-apply-for-a-grant">Who can apply for a grant?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> provides grant aid to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> fisheries. <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> funding is available to support individuals, businesses and co-operatives that put in place organic and environmentally friendly aquaculture measures.</p>

<p>Grant aid is available to:</p>

<ul>
<li>enterprises that are categorised as micro, small or medium-sized, which can get up to 100% of eligible costs</li>
  <li>enterprises that have fewer than 750 employees and a turnover of less than €200 million, which can get up to 80% of eligible costs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-out-your-business-size">Finding out your business size</h3>

<p>For your business to receive the correct classification you need to look at the number of staff it employs, and its annual turnover or balance sheet total.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Business size thresholds</p>
</div>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Enterprise category</th>
      <th>Staff head count</th>
      <th>Turnover</th>
      <th>Balance sheet total</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Micro</td>
      <td>Up to 10</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €2 million</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €2 million</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Small</td>
      <td>Up to 50</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €10 million</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €10 million</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Medium-sized</td>
      <td>Up to 250</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €50 million</td>
      <td>Less than or equal to €50 million</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When you compare your own business against these thresholds, the staff head count criteria must always be used but you can choose whether to meet either the annual turnover or the balance sheet total. You don’t have to meet both financial ceilings and the one that you decline to meet can be higher than the stated figure without your business losing its classification.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/budget/inforeuro/index.cfm?fuseaction=currency_historique&amp;currency=GBP&amp;Language=en">find the latest euro/sterling exchange rates on the Europa website.</a></p>

<h3 id="which-costs-are-eligible">Which costs are eligible?</h3>

<p>Certain items of expenditure can be funded by <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> grants but others are not eligible. You can see a table of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/european-fisheries-fund-fishing-industry-common-interests">items which are and are not eligible for <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> funding</a>.</p>

<p>It’s also a very good idea to speak to your Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) local area facilitator for guidance on which items are eligible and non-eligible. <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/eff_apply.htm">Find contact details for local area facilitators on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-organic-aquaculture-production">What is organic aquaculture production?</h2>

<p>Organic aquaculture is an overall system of management that combines:</p>

<ul>
<li>best environmental practices</li>
  <li>a high level of biodiversity</li>
  <li>preservation of natural resources</li>
  <li>high animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>To qualify as organic, your holding must be managed according to the requirements that apply to organic production.</p>

<p>You are able to split your holding into areas that are farmed organically and those that are farmed traditionally. But these areas must be clearly separated from each other. You can also farm the same species of fish or shellfish organically and non-organically as long as there is adequate separation between the production sites.</p>

<p>If you don’t use all the production units on your holding for organic aquaculture, you must keep the land, animals and products used for, and produced by, the organic units separate from the non-organic units. You also have to keep adequate records that show how the units are separated.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/home_en">read information about organic farming in Europe on the Europa website.</a></p>

<h2 id="organic-aquaculture-rules">Organic aquaculture rules</h2>

<p>There are strict rules that cover organic aquaculture. These deal with many aspects of production including husbandry, breeding and feeding.</p>

<h3 id="the-origin-of-your-stock">The origin of your stock</h3>

<p>Organic aquaculture is based on rearing young stock that comes from organic broodstock and other organic holdings. But if you can’t get hold of young stock from these sources, you can bring in non-organically produced animals under specific conditions.</p>

<h3 id="husbandry">Husbandry</h3>

<p>Husbandry covers a wide range of practices, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>feeding methods</li>
  <li>the design of installations</li>
  <li>stocking densities</li>
  <li>water quality</li>
</ul>
<p>Your organic aquaculture husbandry practices must meet the developmental, physiological and behavioural needs of the animals. So you and your staff should have at least the basic knowledge and skills to safeguard the animals’ health and welfare.</p>

<p>You must also minimise negative environmental impact caused by your holding, including farmed stock escaping. You must also keep organic stock separate from other non-organic aquaculture animals.</p>

<h3 id="breeding">Breeding</h3>

<p>You must choose appropriate stock, and establish species-specific conditions for:</p>

<ul>
<li>broodstock management</li>
  <li>breeding</li>
  <li>juvenile production</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not use:</p>

<ul>
<li>artificial induction of polyploidy</li>
  <li>artificial hybridisation</li>
  <li>cloning</li>
  <li>production of monosex strains, except by hand sorting</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="feeding-fish-and-crustaceans">Feeding fish and crustaceans</h3>

<p>There are various rules that cover feeding fish and crustaceans. The feed you use must meet the animals’ nutritional requirements at their various stages of development. Plant feed must be organically produced, and feed made from other aquatic animals must come from sustainable fisheries. Any non-organic feed you use must be authorised for organic production and you must not use growth promoters and synthetic amino acids.</p>

<h3 id="feeding-bivalve-molluscs-and-other-plankton-feeders">Feeding bivalve molluscs and other plankton feeders</h3>

<p>Species that feed on natural plankton must get all of their nutritional requirements from nature, apart from juveniles reared in hatcheries and nurseries. You must grow these species in Class A or Class B waters with high ecological quality, as set out in organic legislation.</p>

<h3 id="preventing-disease-and-giving-treatment">Preventing disease and giving treatment</h3>

<p>You should prevent disease by keeping the animals in the best possible conditions and make sure that husbandry best practice is always observed throughout the production process. Diseases must be treated immediately, preferably with phytotherapeutic and homeopathic remedies. Products like antibiotics can be used under strict controls when other remedies are inappropriate. And you can also use veterinary medicines to treat immune system disorders.</p>

<h3 id="cleaning-and-disinfecting">Cleaning and disinfecting</h3>

<p>You can only use products authorised for organic production when you clean or disinfect ponds, cages, buildings and installations.</p>

<p>For further details of the rules covering organic production, <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/forms/eff/ax2-oefa001_guidance.pdf">download <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> eligibility guidance notes from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 152KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="conditions-for-environmentally-friendly-aquaculture-projects">Conditions for environmentally friendly aquaculture projects</h2>

<p>If your application for grant aid is for an environmentally friendly aquaculture project, you must commit for a minimum of five years to environmental requirements that go beyond the normal aquaculture good practice.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-impact-assessments">Environmental impact assessments</h3>

<p>As well as committing to the environmental requirements, you also need to submit an environmental impact assessment if the project you’re applying for grant aid for claims to:</p>

<ul>
<li>protect and enhance the environment, natural resources and genetic diversity</li>
  <li>manage the landscape and traditional features of aquaculture zones</li>
</ul>
<p>Your environmental impact assessment must demonstrate the environmental benefits of your proposed project. Assessments must be carried out by a competent body approved by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="approved-competent-bodies">Approved competent bodies</h3>

<p>Approved competent bodies that can carry out environmental impact assessments are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cefas Lowestoft Laboratory, Pakefield Road, Lowestoft, Suffolk NR33 0HT.  01502 562 244</li>
  <li>Cefas Burnham Laboratory, Remembrance Avenue, Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex CM0 8HA.  01621 787 200</li>
  <li>Cefas Weymouth Laboratory, The Nothe, Barrack Road, Weymouth, Dorset, DT4 8UB.  01305 206 600</li>
  <li>FRS Marine Laboratory, PO Box 101, 375 Victoria Road, Aberdeen, AB11 9DB.  01224 876 544</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as these organisations, some universities that support aqua-environmental development work may offer services for environmental impact assessments.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-business-case">Writing a business case</h2>

<p>Applications for both organic and environmentally friendly aquaculture projects have to include a detailed business case that demonstrates your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>has quantified outputs and clear and achievable targets</li>
  <li>will provide an additional and sustainable benefit to the fishing industry</li>
  <li>has a justified need for a grant</li>
  <li>will provide good value for money</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="economic-viability">Economic viability</h3>

<p>You have to carry out market research to demonstrate the economic viability of projects that involve:</p>

<ul>
<li>diversification towards new species</li>
  <li>production of species with good market prospects</li>
</ul>
<p>For projects that involve diversification towards new species, you also have to show that the rearing techniques you will use are technically well established and tested.</p>

<h3 id="consents">Consents</h3>

<p>You will need to get all the necessary consents, including Several and Regulating Orders. For more information, see the guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/shellfisheries-several-orders-and-regulating-orders">shellfish management.</a></p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-the-project">Benefits of the project</h3>

<p>You have to quantify what the benefits of your project will be and give details of how you calculated this. You also need to show how the benefits will continue once the grant support comes to an end.</p>

<p>You will also have to give details of how your business and the fishing industry as a whole will benefit from your project. As a part of this, you must provide an appraisal of the project comparing its benefits with its costs and show what would happen if the project didn’t go ahead.</p>

<h3 id="calculating-your-costs">Calculating your costs</h3>

<p>You need to give details of how much extra it will cost you to change to environmentally friendly production methods over a two-year period.</p>

<p>The amount of grant aid you get will be based on your costs.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-of-quotes">Analysis of quotes</h3>

<p>Depending on the overall value of your project, there are a set minimum number of quotes you need to get from suppliers. Include copies of all these quotes with your application.</p>

<h3 id="expected-results">Expected results</h3>

<p>If your application for grant aid is successful, the offer letter will include specific targets and conditions based on your business plan. It is important to provide accurate details of your expected results and timescales and make sure they are precise.</p>

<h3 id="publicity-monitoring-and-risk-management">Publicity, monitoring and risk management</h3>

<p>You need to provide details of how you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>publicise the project, including the mandatory publicity for projects over €500,000</li>
  <li>monitor the project</li>
  <li>manage your risks while you’re delivering the project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="information-about-your-business">Information about your business</h3>

<p>You have to provide financial information about your business, as well as details of your experiences running similar projects.</p>

<p>For further details about what to include in your business case, <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/forms/eff/economic_appraisal_guidance.pdf">download guidance on compiling a business case and an economic appraisal from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 116KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="how-much-grant-aid-could-you-get">How much grant aid could you get?</h2>

<p>Grant aid is awarded to the projects that demonstrate the best value for money. The scheme is competitive and there’s no guarantee that your project will qualify for funding.</p>

<p>If your application is successful you will receive a percentage of the total eligible cost of your project. The minimum amount of grant funding is £400 and the maximum you can receive is £100,000. You will only receive grant funding once you have spent money on your project.</p>

<p>Micro, small and medium-sized businesses can receive up to 100% of eligible costs. Other applicants can get up to 80%. </p>

<h3 id="grant-funding-conditions">Grant funding conditions</h3>

<p>You can only receive grant aid on your project from one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> fund. So you have to confirm on the application form that you haven’t applied for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> funding under a different scheme.</p>

<p>Your project must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK legislation. And it must have a funding package which includes match funding from UK public money administered by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>, as well as from private funds.</p>

<h3 id="the-offer-letter">The offer letter</h3>

<p>If you succeed with your application for grant aid, you will receive an offer letter from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>. This is a mutual undertaking between you and the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> that sets out details of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the conditions attached to the offer of the grant - these are based on the general conditions of the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> and may also include some that are specific to your project</li>
  <li>the agreed performance targets and outputs of the project</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to meet these conditions and targets or the grant will not be paid. For full details of the general conditions of the <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/forms/eff/ax2-oefa001_guidance.pdf">download guidance on the eligibility criteria of marine funding from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website (PDF, 152KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-for-a-grant">How to apply for a grant</h2>

<p>You apply for a <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr> organic and environmentally friendly measures grant using form <abbr title="European Fisheries Fund">EFF</abbr>-AX12-OEFA which you can download from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website. <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> local area facilitators can help you with the application process if you have any queries. There are also eligibility guidance notes available to download from the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website to help you fill in the application form.</p>

<h3 id="projects-that-cover-more-than-one-uk-country">Projects that cover more than one UK country</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> only deals with applications from England. Applications for the rest of the UK are dealt with by the relevant devolved administration. But if your project covers more than one country in the UK, you only need to make a single application to the administration where your business is based. If you’re based outside of England, the administration you apply to will contact the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> for a decision on who will lead the project and where the funding will come from.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.marinemanagement.org.uk/fisheries/funding/eff_apply.htm">find forms, application advice and contact details for local area facilitators on the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> website.</a></p>
