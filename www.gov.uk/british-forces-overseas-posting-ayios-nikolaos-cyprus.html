<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Ayios Nikolaos is about 20 minutes’ drive from Dhekelia Garrison next to the border with the Turkish-occupied north. The station is located in the Eastern Sovereign Base Area (<abbr title="Eastern Sovereign Base Area">ESBA</abbr>) on the main road to Famagusta. Our location places us just 20-30 minutes drive from Protaras and Ayia Napa, two of the island’s most renowned night life and tourist areas. The station is home to the majority of <abbr title="Joint Service Signal Unit">JSSU</abbr> Cyprus and its command.</p>

<p>All new arrivals receive a briefing about the station. UK dependents and UK based civilians must also attend the new arrival brief, which is held at the Forum. It is compulsory for you and your spouse to attend this brief at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="joint-service-signal-unit-cyprus">Joint Service Signal Unit Cyprus</h2>

<p>The Joint Service Signal Unit (Cyprus) (<abbr title="Joint Service Signal Unit (Cyprus)">JSSU(Cyp)</abbr>) was formed in 2003 as a result of the amalgamation of Joint Service Signal Unit (Ayios Nikolaos) and elements of 12 Signal Unit RAF. As part of the Joint Service Signal Organisation, the Joint Service Signal Unit is a static communications organisation maintaining secure links from Cyprus to the rest of the world. </p>

<p>It is a fully integrated, proactive and responsive Joint Service Signal Unit, making a key contribution to defence.
The vast majority of the unit’s personnel live and work in Ayios Nikolaos in the Eastern Sovereign Base Area, however the unit also has large detachments at Akrotiri and Episkopi in the Western Sovereign Base Area and at the Retained Site in Troodos.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Service Signal Unit (Cyprus)">JSSU(Cyp)</abbr> is commanded by a Royal Signals Lieutenant Colonel but officers from all three services make up the unit’s hierarchy to ensure tri-service representation. Due to the range of complex communications equipment used it also employs a large number of MOD civil servants and contractors as well as locally employed civilians. </p>

<p>The unit consists of 3 Squadrons: 1 Squadron is responsible for conducting operations, 2 Squadron for operational engineering support and Headquarters Squadron for defence, infrastructure and logistic support.</p>

<p>The unit has Royal Signals personnel employed variously in the command and training role or as special operators, technicians, drivers and suppliers, and Royal Logistic Corps personnel employed as chefs, drivers and suppliers. Other Army Corps such as the Royal Engineers, Intelligence Corps and Adjutant General’s Corps are also employed at <abbr title="Joint Service Signal Unit">JSSU</abbr> (Cyp). Specialist operators and technicians from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force work alongside the Army Corps personnel as well as a number of civilian personnel based at <abbr title="Joint Service Signal Unit">JSSU</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="accommodation-at-ayios-nikolaos">Accommodation at Ayios Nikolaos</h2>

<p>Ayios Nikolaos Station has three estates: Seaforth Estate, Cape Estate and Alexander Court. Two of the estates comprise of modern semi-detached houses built in 1995, and have central heating installed with solar panels for heating water. The other estate comprises of older houses which have immersion-heated water and portable gas heaters.</p>

<p>Both the Seaforth and Cape Estates are located on the station, and Alexander Court is located in the village no more than a mile from station.</p>

<p>Three large barrack blocks provide single accommodation with shared ablutions.</p>

<p>Prior to arrival your room or quarter will have been marched in for you. For those in quarters a ‘get you in pack’ with bedding, cookware and other necessities will be provided until your household items arrive on the island.</p>

<p>Your sponsor will assist with your initial settlement into Ayios Nikolaos and help with any questions and paperwork.</p>

<p>Personnel posted to <abbr title="Joint Service Signal Unit">JSSU</abbr> but detached to Akrotiri, Episkopi and Troodos will reside in accommodation on their detached units.</p>

<h3 id="ayios-nikolaos-primary-school">Ayios Nikolaos Primary School</h3>

<p>Ayios Nikolaos has its own [infant and primary school], (http://www.school-portal.co.uk/GroupHomepage.asp?GroupID=723205 “Ayios Nikolaos Primary School”) located on the Seaforth Estate. </p>

<h3 id="king-richard-secondary-school">King Richard Secondary School</h3>

<p>The King Richard Secondary School (KRS) is located at Dhekelia and serves the whole of the <abbr title="Eastern Sovereign Base Area">ESBA</abbr>, for children between 11 and 18 years.</p>

<p>UK qualified teachers who are recruited by the Service Children’s Education Authority (<abbr title="Service Children's Education Authority">SCEA</abbr>) staff all schools. And a UK curriculum is taught so SATs and GCSEs still take place for children of the relevant age groups. Further education also takes place on the island and the opportunity for teenagers to do A Levels is also available.</p>

<p>School finishes around lunchtime but with a very early start. This is due to the hot weather experienced throughout the summer.</p>

<h3 id="adult-education">Adult education</h3>

<p>Adult education is also available. Ayos Nikolaos has its own education centre for both service personnel and their dependents to use. The centre runs a variety of local courses and liaises with Dhekelia where you can also take part in courses.</p>
