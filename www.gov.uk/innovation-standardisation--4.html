<h2 id="standardisation">Standardisation</h2>

<p>Standardisation helps innovation to be applied to the whole economy and makes sure that most companies are not too far behind the early adopters of new ideas.</p>

<p>Standardisation can help business by:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing better access to markets </li>
  <li>delivering measurable benefits when used within the infrastructure of a company itself</li>
  <li>minimising business costs and risks </li>
  <li>streamlining internal processes</li>
  <li>improving communication</li>
</ul>
<p>By promoting interoperability, standardisation provides a competitive edge in the market place; necessary for worldwide trading of products and services. In particular for SMEs, demonstrable compliance with an accepted standard can replace the power of a big brand.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-standardisation">What is standardisation?</h3>

<p>Standardisation includes the development of the standard as well as how it is used. End-users should have confidence in their purchase because the supplier has used an appropriate standard and has gone through independent assessment.</p>

<h3 id="biss-role-in-standardisation">
<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>’s role in standardisation</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> is responsible for UK government policy on everything to do with standards-making, accreditation and conformity assessment. We will strengthen the standards, accreditation and conformity assessment infrastructure so that it meets the needs of UK industry and to make the processes more relevant and business friendly. We sponsor, and work closely with, the British Standards Institution (<abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>) as the UK National Standards Body (<abbr title="UK National Standards Body">NSB</abbr>) and the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) as the National Accreditation Body (<abbr title="National Accreditation Body">NAB</abbr>).</p>

<p>Through the European Commission (EC) we help develop European standardisation policy, which can remove barriers to trade. This includes the recent EC regulation on accreditation and market surveillance, and the EC decision on a common framework for marketing products.</p>

<p>We are also the central contact point for Directive 98/34/EC that requires member states to notify the EC of proposed national technical regulations; and Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment; and Refusals of Mutual Recognition Decision 3052/95/EC.</p>

<p>We work closely with technical regulations colleagues and also a number of other government departments.</p>

<p>The MOD’s <abbr title="(UK Defence Standardization">DStan</abbr> (UK Defence Standardization) works to develop, facilitate and communicate UK MOD standardisation policies, standards, procedures and guidance on standardisation both nationally and internationally. </p>

<h2 id="standardisation-infrastructure">Standardisation infrastructure</h2>

<p>Conformity assessment helps companies demonstrate that they have met customers’ needs and includes activities like testing, inspection and certification. The organisations that test, inspect, etc, are known as Conformity Assessment Bodies (<abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies">CABs</abbr>). <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> works to make sure conformity assessment in the UK is well managed, competent and market driven, and so contributes to the productivity and competitiveness of UK businesses.</p>

<p><abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies">CABs</abbr> notified to the Commission under the European New Approach legislation are known as Notified Bodies (<abbr title="Notified bodies">NBs</abbr>). Where there is European Community legislation, the requirements for <abbr title="Notified bodies">NBs</abbr> makes sure that products and services assessed in one member state can be accepted in another. However, where there are national regulatory requirements, conformity assessment requirements can differ from country to country and can create barriers to trade. Our work on the quality and conformity assessment infrastructure helps to reduce these barriers by providing ways that allow recognition of conformity assessment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> has produced a guidance document for regulators, on the conformity assessment aspects of European Decision 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products. It deals with the requirements for notification of <abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies">CABs</abbr> and conformity assessment procedures. </p>

<h3 id="accreditation">Accreditation</h3>

<p>Accreditation is given when a conformity assessment body is recognised as competent to carry out specific tasks. It is generally accepted that for an accreditation body to be authoritative it must have the support of government.</p>

<p>A statement of the main principles relating to conformity assessment policy in the UK, including accreditation, has been developed and was first published in May 2005.</p>

<h3 id="standards">Standards</h3>

<p>Standards are the the most important point of the infrastructure, providing the matrix in which the other elements operate with <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>, playing an important role in developing standards domestically and internationally.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>If you are a toy maker the chances are you will wish to manufacture your toy so that it meets the relevant international and national standards - this will help you sell your product in the UK as well as overseas. To demonstrate to buyers that your product really does meet the standard you will need to employ an independent and impartial third party to assess your product against the standard. These third parties are known as conformity assessment bodies (<abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies">CABs</abbr>).</p>

<p>You wouldn’t want to use any old organisation, but a CAB who you know to be competent and whose assessment will be universally accepted. National Accreditation Bodies (NABS) - <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> is the UK’s <abbr title="National Accreditation Body">NAB</abbr> - assess the <abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies">CABs</abbr> against international standards to make sure that they are competent to assess against specific standards.</p>

<p>NABs are reviewed to make sure that they are competent by taking evaluations by their peers and by being subject to government audit and appointment.</p>

<p>This infrastructure provides confidence, trust and assurance to consumers and purchasers that the toy meets the standard that the manufacturer claims it does.</p>

<h2 id="non-accredited-certification">Non-accredited certification</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> is aware that some certification bodies and certification body representative associations are concerned at the increase in the number of UK organisations offering non-accredited certification.</p>

<p>For more information, have a look at <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/c/12-759-conformity-assessment-and-accreditation-policy.pdf">Conformity Assessment Accreditation Policy</a>  on Accreditation and Conformity Assessment, and specifically to section 3.4 on the application of the accreditation principles:</p>

<p>“In applying these principles, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>recommends Conformity Assessment Bodies to be accredited by the National Accreditation Body</li>
  <li>recommends UK businesses, government and local authorities requiring third party conformity assessment services to source such services, where they exist, from conformity assessment bodies accredited by a National Accreditation Body.”</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> has further advised certification representative organisations in the UK that:</p>

<p>You can only get ‘accreditation’ (in the UK) from United Kingdom Accreditation Service through the regulation. Any organisation that is suggesting it is accredited in the sense of the regulation when they are not, is likely to be guilty of an offence under the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008 (Statutory Instrument 2008/1276).</p>

<p>Certification bodies or representative organisations should refer these cases to trading standards or the Office of Fair Trading in the first instance. </p>

<h2 id="eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance">EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and market surveillance</h2>

<p>On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation will, for the first time, establish a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.</p>

<p>Article 4(1) of Regulation 765/08 required that <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> appoint a single National Accreditation Body (<abbr title="National Accreditation Body">NAB</abbr>) for the United Kingdom. The Accreditation Regulations 2009 (Statutory Instrument 2009 No. 3155), laid in Parliament on 3 December 2009, appointed the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) as the UK’s <abbr title="National Accreditation Body">NAB</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/contents/made">statutory instrument</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3155/memorandum/contents">explanatory memorandum</a> are available from the legislation.gov.uk website.</p>

<p>In support of this statutory instrument, <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> signed, on 8 December 2009, a revised memorandum of understanding with <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="implementation-of-eu-regulation-76508-on-accreditation-and-market-surveillance-in-the-united-kingdom">Implementation of EU Regulation 765/08 on accreditation and Market Surveillance in the United Kingdom</h3>

<p>On 9 July 2008 the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Regulation 765/08 on Accreditation and Market Surveillance.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2010, the EU Regulation established a legal framework for providing accreditation services across Europe. The regulation lays down rules on the organisation and operation of accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in both the voluntary and regulated sectors.</p>

<p>Drafts of both the statutory instrument and <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> were tabled at the <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> Policy Advisory Committee on 1 October 2009 as well as being circulated to the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> conformity assessment consultation group (ConCAss). While the main interest in these documents is contained within these 2 groups, they were open for comment to the public in general, and a copy is available below. <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>’s response to the comments received was made on 25 November 2009.</p>

<h2 id="british-standards-institution-bsi">British Standards Institution (<abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Our work in this area covers:</p>

<ul>
<li>the government’s general policy on matters relating to standards-making (but not on the individual standards)</li>
  <li>the government’s relations with the British Standards Institution (<abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>) and its funding of <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>’s standards development work, including support for delegations representing the UK at overseas standards meetings and for consumer representation in standards-making activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumer representation is vital in influencing the standards to reflect the needs and expectations of the general public for things like safety and security, labelling, accessibility, fairness and redress.  More can be found about consumer representation and <a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services"><abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>’s Consumer and Public Interest Network on the <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> itself is an independent body, established by Royal Charter in the 1920s, although its origins go back to 1901. Its HQ is at Chiswick. More information can be found on <a rel="external" href="http://www.bsigroup.com/"><abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr>’s own website</a></p>

<p><abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills recognise that, whilst the process of developing standards facilitated by <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> in the UK is a voluntary activity, there is a public interest in standardisation.</p>

<p>A revised memorandum of understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>) between <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> and the department was signed on 20 June 2002. The main changes from the previous <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> included:</p>

<ul>
<li>incorporation of main points from the joint statement of the public interest</li>
  <li>recognition that <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> has significant commercial businesses outside its <abbr title="UK National Standards Body">NSB</abbr> functions, and focuses on the relationship between the <abbr title="UK National Standards Body">NSB</abbr> and non-<abbr title="UK National Standards Body">NSB</abbr> sides - this has meant defining a ‘ring-fence’ both in terms of the use of public funds and in the precedence of the <abbr title="UK National Standards Body">NSB</abbr> as a whole</li>
  <li>an indication of a willingness in principle to provide government support if the <abbr title="UK National Standards Body">NSB</abbr> runs into major difficulties</li>
  <li>strengthening of the international and European context, including a specific reference to standardisation policy developed by the Council of the EU</li>
  <li>clear encouragement to <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> to develop their standardisation business beyond traditional ‘full’ standards in response to new technology, globalisation, etc, coupling this with a specific obligation to avoid ‘new products’ spreading at the expense of full standards in circumstances where the new features of full standards are still required</li>
</ul>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>), provides a framework for <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> and the government to meet the challenges to the UK’s standards-making infrastructure.</p>

</section><h3 id="funding">Funding</h3>

<p>The government’s funding of <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> standards work is provided in 2 main ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>as direct financial support to <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> (which is linked to specific deliverables)</li>
  <li>as help to those involved in the standards preparation work</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="schemes">Schemes</h3>

<ul>
<li>the Assisted International Travel Scheme provides a contribution towards the travel costs of the leaders of committee delegations to overseas standards meetings</li>
  <li>the Consultancy Drafting Scheme allows the <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> technical committees to use an outside expert to help prepare the first draft of a standard that is needed quickly</li>
  <li>the consumer travel expenses fund contributes to the travel costs of consumer representatives in national and overseas committees</li>
</ul>
<p>As a condition on approval of funding of <abbr title="British Standards Institute">BSI</abbr> and standards-making activities in 2000-2001, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry requested that a study be carried out of the economic benefits of standardisation, in particular of the government’s financial support for standardisation.</p>

<p>Professor Peter Swann of Manchester Business School, conducted this study, beginning with a review of the literature in this particular field. The report of his study is available below in English, French and German, along with an update from May 2010 exploring developments and progress. </p>

</section><h2 id="united-kingdom-accreditation-service-ukas">United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Under a <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>, <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> is recognised as the sole UK organisation for the accreditation of certification, testing and inspection bodies to the EN 45000 and ISO 17000 series of standards. These bodies - the Conformity Assessment Bodies - in turn certify, test and inspect companies’ systems and products.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> is licensed by <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> to use and confer the national accreditation symbols (formerly national accreditation marks) which symbolise government recognition of the accreditation process.</p>

<p>Information on <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> and accredited organisations is available from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.ukas.com/"><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website</a>. <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>-accredited certification bodies and companies registered by <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>-accredited certification bodies are listed in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.tso-quality.co.uk/qaregister/subscriber/about.htm">United Kingdom Register of Quality Assessed Companies published by the Stationery Office.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of conformity assessment bodies. <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>-accredited certification, testing and calibration and inspection reduces the need for suppliers to be assessed by each of their customers. <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>’ involvement in international groups provides mutual recognition that reduces the need for multiple assessments of suppliers and as a helps to reduce barriers to trade. <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> therefore recommends the use of <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited conformity assessment services whenever this is an option.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> also assesses potential Notified Bodies on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> and other government departments according to the principles established by <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="recent-ec-legislation">Recent EC legislation</h2>

<ul>
<li>EC Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance [EC 765 of 2008]</li>
  <li>EC Decision on a common framework for the marketing of products [EC 768 of 2008]</li>
</ul>
<p>have received approval, following a review of the new approach. These are complementary and both aim to improve the free movement of goods within the internal market.</p>

<p>The regulation puts accreditation into a legal framework in the EEA, enhancing confidence in conformity assessment by strengthening the role of accreditation. It will also reinforce market surveillance structures to protect citizens from unsafe products (including those from outside the EU) and helps compliant businesses by removing those products from the market.</p>

<p>The decision, which will not have direct effect in member states, will set a formal framework for future European legislative proposals that fall within its scope. The scope is very broad for both proposals and includes all products subject to community harmonisation legislation (with notable exceptions such as food and medicines). The decision contains additional measures that will be integrated into the legal framework as specific legislative proposals are brought forward. This will clarify commonly used procedures and terms (which are often used differently) so that all stakeholders can be clear on relative responsibilities. In addition there are new rules to enhance confidence in CE marking.</p>

<h2 id="eu-notification-requirements-goods-and-electronic-services">EU notification requirements: goods and electronic services</h2>

<h3 id="directive-9834ec">Directive 98/34/EC</h3>

<p>EU Notification requirements for goods and electronic services is known as the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 98/34/EC (as amended by Directive 98/48/EC).</p>

<p>The directive applies to ‘information society services’ (ie services supplied at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services), and to all industrially manufactured products and agricultural products.</p>

<p>The directive aims to prevent new technical barriers to trade being created and has a procedure for providing information on technical standards and regulation. It applies to all member states, the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), EFTA (Switzerland) and Turkey.</p>

<h3 id="technical-regulations">Technical regulations</h3>

<p>Regulations that need notification have to be notified to the commission in draft, and generally observe a 3-month ‘standstill’ period before the regulation is made or brought into force. This is so that the  commission and member states can raise concerns about potential barriers to trade. If a notified regulation is considered as a barrier to trade, a detailed opinion may be submitted and this will extend the standstill period for a another 3 months.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> acts as the central unit for the UK, administering the notification procedure on behalf of government departments and receiving other member states’ notifications for onward transmission to the relevant department. Government departments involve industry as appropriate in their comments.</p>

<h2 id="directive-9834---a-guide">Directive 98/34 - a guide</h2>

<p>Directive 98/34 sets up a legal mechanism, which requests member states to notify the commission and the other members of their technical regulations, at a draft stage, where amendments can still be introduced and a standstill period of 3 months observed before the draft technical regulation (except for urgencies, fiscal and financial measures) is adopted.</p>

</section><h2 id="case-study-non-notification-of-technical-regulations-under-directive-9834ec--video-recordings-act-1984">Case study: non-notification of technical regulations under directive 98/34/ec – video recordings act 1984</h2>

<p>In late 2009 there was a great deal of negative press coverage when it was discovered that the provisions of the Video Recordings Act 1984 were unenforceable as a result of the UK’s failure to notify the measure under Directive 98/34/EC. It was made clear that, because of the unenforceability of the regulations, legislation that would protect under 18s from unsuitable videos - potentially containing violent or sexually-explicit material - was never enacted.</p>

<p>Although non-notification of technical regulations falling within the scope of Directive 98/34/EC is not a major issue in the UK, the consequences of any failure to notify can be serious and steps have been taken to make sure that this situation does not arise again.</p>

<p>Once the non-enforceability of the Video Recordings Act was discovered, the relevant legislation was notified to the European Commission in September 2009 (notification 2009/0495/UK - The Video Recordings Act 1984 (as adopted by the Video Recordings Bill) and The Video Recordings (Labelling) <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;iNumber=0495&amp;">Regulations to be made under section 8 of the adopted 1984 Act</a></p>

<p>This was followed in December 2009 by the related notification 2009/0664/UK - <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2009&amp;iNumber=0664&amp;">The Digital Economy Bill (extract of five clauses and a Schedule</a></p>

<p>In October 2009 a joint Cabinet Office/<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> letter was sent to Permanent Secretaries reminding government departments of the need to comply with the provisions of Directive 98/34/EC. <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> followed this up in early 2010 with a letter to Directive 98/34/EC policy leads, drawing attention to a request in the Cabinet Office/<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> communication of October 2009 for all government departments to carry out an assessment of all technical regulations they had made since 1983 for compatibility with the directive, in order to ensure that all relevant legislation had been correctly notified.</p>

<p>Following the Cabinet Office and <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> letters of late 2009 and early 2010, government departments carried out their assessments as requested. Although we received confirmations that regulations compatible with Directive 98/34/EC had been notified, further instances of non-notification came to light. The following are examples of notifications submitted as a result of assessments revealing failure to comply with the directive as required:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;iNumber=0318&amp;sCountry=UK&amp;">2010/0318/UK - PAS66:2009 Official identification eartags for sheep and goats – Specification</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/pisa/app/search/index.cfm?iYear=2010&amp;iNumber=0319&amp;sCountry=UK&amp;">2010/0319/UK - 2010/0319/UK - PAS44:2009 Official identification for cattle – Specification</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The lesson learned from the above is that it is very important for all government departments to constantly check any proposed new legislation for notifiability under Directive 98/34/EC, and notify any compatible regulations in draft before making them. </p>

<h2 id="notifications-and-comments">Notifications and comments</h2>

<h3 id="how-the-notification-system-works">How the notification system works</h3>

<p>It is based on member states consulting each other and the commission before they adopt technical regulations and to modify their drafts if necessary. The directive requires member states to communicate to the commission any draft technical regulation which they plan to adopt using the notification form available on our website.</p>

<p>Each member state has a central contact point for the directive which coordinates notifications of new national technical regulations as well as those received from other member states, as well as responses to the notifications. The UK contact point is in the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and can be contacted by email: 9834@bis.gsi.gov.uk</p>

<p>When a new technical regulation is notified, the notification form (in pdf) is completed by the department proposing the measure, specifying the content and reasons for its enactment. The completed form is then sent to the central contact point for processing and forwarding to the commission, together with the draft text of the regulation to be notified, impact assessment if one is available and other relevant documentation that would help the commission and other member states in assessing the measure.</p>

<p>The commission then sends all the information communicated by the notifying member state to all the other member states and allocates a 3-month standstill period. The date of receipt by the commission of the draft national technical regulation communicated by a member state and of all the requested documents is the beginning of the 3-month standstill period during which the member state concerned is strictly obliged not to adopt the draft notified regulation. During this standstill period, the commission or member states can respond with comments or a detailed opinion.</p>

<p>When notifications from other member states are received, the central contact point forwards them to the lead department and other departments with an interest, providing an opportunity to submit comments or detailed opinions if they feel this is appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-send-comments">When to send comments</h3>

<p>Comments are sent when the notified text, although in accordance with community law, raises issues of interpretation or calls for details of the arrangements for its implementation. They can also give an overall assessment of the measure, having regard to the general principles of community law and policies implemented in this context, or inform the member state of its future obligations with regard to acts to be adopted on a community level. Comments do not extend the initial 3-month standstill period.</p>

<h3 id="responding-to-comments">Responding to comments</h3>

<p>Under the directive, the notifying member state has no formal obligation to reply to the comments received. In practice, however, member states frequently do so on a voluntary basis and generally take account of comments they receive. All responses to comments should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.</p>

<h3 id="detailed-opinions">“Detailed opinions”</h3>

<p>Detailed opinions are sent by the commission or the member states when they consider that the draft measure envisaged would, if adopted, create obstacles to the free movement of goods, the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment of service operators within the internal market. These detailed opinions seek to obtain an amendment to the proposed measure, in order to remove at source any resulting barriers to such freedoms. A detailed opinion received on a notification extends the initial 3-month standstill period by another 3 months, ie to a total of 6 months.</p>

<h3 id="responding-to-a-detailed-opinion">Responding to a detailed opinion</h3>

<p>Member states must reply to a detailed opinion addressed to them by the commission or another member state. Although the directive does not specify the time allowed for reply, it is nevertheless desirable that a response be made as soon as possible in the interests of efficiency, preferably during the standstill periods of 6 or 4 months, respectively for goods and information society services. All responses to detailed opinions should be emailed to the central contact point for forwarding to the commission.</p>

<h3 id="confirmation-that-a-member-state-is-free-to-make-a-regulation-once-the-standstill-period-has-ended">Confirmation that a member state is free to make a regulation once the standstill period has ended</h3>

<p>Confirmation is received from the commission. Once a standstill period for any particular notification has ended, the originator is free to make the regulation provided that no comments or opinions have been received and/or there are no issues still outstanding as result of a detailed opinion. It is a good idea to check with the central point just after the standstill period has ended, in case any last minute comments or opinions have been submitted.</p>

<h3 id="national-regulations-and-notification">National regulations and notification</h3>

<p>Only those technical regulations that come within the scope of the directive require notification and there are certain exceptions allowed in the directive. The directive defines what is a ‘technical regulation’ and it is very wide in scope, for example it includes codes of practice and voluntary agreements so government departments have to check whether the regulations they wish to enact come within the scope of notification. If they do, the department should notify the regulations at a draft stage and observe the standstill period before adopting the regulation.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-a-regulation-is-not-notified">What if a regulation is not notified?</h3>

<p>The commission can initiate infraction proceedings for failure to notify a national regulation that comes within the scope of the directive. If in doubt measures should be notified in draft since a non-notified measure which should have been notified will be unenforceable. It is not possible to make a notification if a regulation is already in force.</p>

<h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>

<p>The central contact point in <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> will be happy to give you further information or answer your queries. In addition to the information that is already available on our website, you may also find the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/tris/index_en.htm">Commission’s website on Directive 98/34/EC</a> helpful from where you can download reference documents for example, the text of the Directive, Commission’s guidance document, their reports on the functioning of the Directive and case law as well as the ability to search their database of notifications already made by member states.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-a-notification">Submitting a notification</h3>

<p>For government departments or agencies wishing to know more about the directive and the notification system, guidance for officials is also available. Government departments or agencies should use Form A (below) with the associated guidance document for notifying proposed technical regulations.</p>
