</ul></article><article id="freelancers-consultants-and-contractors"><header><h1>Part 5: Freelancers, consultants and contractors</h1>

  <li>they might not be entitled to the same rights as workers, eg minimum wage</li>
  <li>you’re still responsible for their health and safety</li>
</ul></article><article id="zero-hour-contracts"><header><h1>Part 6: Zero hour contracts</h1>

  <li>you don’t have to give them work</li>
  <li>they don’t have to do work when asked</li>

</article><article id="employing-family-young-people-and-volunteers"><header><h1>Part 7: Employing family, young people and volunteers</h1>
  </header><h2>Family</h2>

<p>If you hire family members you must:</p>

<ul>

  <li>must give inductions and training in the tasks they’re going to do</li>
</ul>
<h2>Young people</h2>

<p>You can employ young people if they are 13 or over but there are <a href="/child-employment" title="Child employment">special rules</a> about how long they can work and what jobs they can do. Once someone is 18 they’re classed as an ‘adult worker’ and different rules apply. </p>

<p>As well as following these <a href="/child-employment" title="Child employment">rules</a> you must do a risk assessment before taking on young workers.</p>

<p>Young people may also have certain employment rights like:</p>

<ul>
<li>statutory maternity pay and ordinary statutory paternity pay if they qualify as a result of their <a href="/continuous-employment-what-it-is" title="Continuous employment">continuous employment</a>
</li>
  <li>paid time off for study and training</li>
  <li>redundancy pay</li>
