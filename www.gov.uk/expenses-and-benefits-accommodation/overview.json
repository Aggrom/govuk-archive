provide the accommodation for part of the year, use that proportion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Deduct any rent you get from the employee.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br />\nBuying price: \u00a3175,000<br />\nGross rating value: \u00a31,000<br />\nEmployee rent: \u00a31,250<br />\nInterest rate: 4%  </p>\n\n<p>The standard reportable value is \u00a30, because the rent is more than the annual rating value. </p>\n\n<p>Additional charge is \u00a33,750:<br />\n\u00a3175,000 - \u00a375,000 = \u00a3100,000<br
