  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>As an employer providing accommodation for your employees, you have certain tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.</p>

<h2>What’s included</h2>

<p>As well as the costs of the accommodation itself, this includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Council Tax </li>
  <li>water and sewerage charges </li>
  <li>heating, lighting and cleaning </li>
  <li>repair, maintenance and decoration </li>
  <li>furniture for daily use </li>
  <li>staff for upkeep of accommodation, eg gardeners and cleaners</li>
</ul></article><article id="whats-exempt"><header><h1>Part 2: What's exempt</h1>
  </header><p>You don’t have to report or pay anything to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) on the cost of certain types of accommodation.</p>

<h2>If it’s domestic or personal</h2>
<p>For example, accommodation you provide for your son or daughter if they work in your business is exempt.</p>

<h2>If it’s provided by a local council</h2>
<p>Accommodation is exempt if a local council provides it on the same terms that it provides housing to non-employees.</p>

<h2>If it’s necessary or usually provided for the job</h2>
<p>Accommodation at the place of work is exempt if:</p>

<ul>
<li>your employees can’t do their work properly without it, eg agricultural workers living on farms</li>
  <li>it’s common to provide it for a particular type of job, eg vicars, soldiers or pub managers</li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide the accommodation to company directors, they have to be either full-time or work for a non-profit or charity organisation and hold less than 5% of the shares.</p>

<h2>If it’s needed for security</h2>
<p>If you need to provide accommodation to protect an employee because of a special threat to their security, this is exempt.</p>

<h2>Other charges and costs</h2>
<p>If the accommodation you provide is exempt, you don’t have to report Council Tax, water and sewerage charges to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, or pay National Insurance and tax.</p>

<p>You also don’t have to report and pay if you arrange accommodation maintenance contracts with suppliers and:</p>

<ul>
<li>you pay the supplier directly</li>
  <li>the accommodation is for employees earning <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="Calculate earnings 'at a rate'">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or less a year</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>If the accommodation you provide isn’t <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-accommodation/whats-exempt" title="Exempt">exempt</a>, you must report it to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). You may have to deduct and pay tax and National Insurance on the accommodation and any related costs, eg Council Tax or upkeep. </p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>This includes any accommodation you provide, even if the employee doesn’t actually use it (see <a href="/expenses-and-benefits-accommodation/technical-guidance" title="Technical guidance">technical guidance</a> for details).</p>

</table></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 4: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><p>To work out the value of living accommodation follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Use the greater of the ‘annual value’ (as shown in the table below) or the rent you pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you provide the accommodation only part of the year use that proportion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deduct any rent you get from your employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the accommodation is shared or only partly used for business use that proportion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The annual value to use depends on where the property is.</p>

<h2>Properties over £75,000</h2>

<p>You must add an additional charge to the standard value. </p>

<p>To start with you have to calculate the ‘cost of the accommodation’:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Add anything you spent on improvements to the original buying price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deduct any reimbursements by employees from these amounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you held an interest in the property 6 years before your employee occupied it and they first occupied it after March 1983, use the value of the property at the time your employee moved in, rather than the original buying price.</p>

<p>To calculate the additional charge do the following: </p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Deduct £75,000 from the cost of the accommodation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply what’s left by the official rate of interest - if you only provide the accommodation for part of the year, use that proportion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deduct any rent you get from the employee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Buying price: £175,000<br>
Gross rating value: £1,000<br>
Employee rent: £1,250<br>
Interest rate: 4%  </p>

<p>The standard reportable value is £0, because the rent is more than the annual rating value. </p>

<p>Additional charge is £3,750:<br>
£175,000 - £75,000 = £100,000<br>
£100,000 x 4% = £4,000<br>
£4,000 - £250 (left over rent from standard value) = £3,750  </p>

<p>Total value to report is £3,750:<br>
Standard value (£0) + additional charge (£3,750)</p>
