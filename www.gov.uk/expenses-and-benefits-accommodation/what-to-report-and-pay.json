Use the greater of the 'annual value' (as shown in the table below) or the rent you pay. \r\ns2. If you provide the accommodation only part of the year use that proportion. \r\ns3. Deduct any rent you get from your employee. \r\ns4. If the accommodation is shared or only partly used for business use that proportion.\r\n\r\nThe annual value to use depends on where the property is.\r\n\r\nCountry | Annual value\r\n- | -\r\nEngland and Wales | 1973 gross rating value\r\nNorthern Ireland | 1976 gross rating value \r\nScotland | 1985 gross rating value divided by 2.7\r\nOutside the UK | Annual rental value on the open market\r\n\r\n##Properties over \u00a375,000\r\n\r\nYou must add an additional charge to the standard value. \r\n\r\nTo start with you have to calculate the 'cost of the accommodation':\r\n\r\ns1. Add anything you spent on improvements to the original buying price. \r\ns2. Deduct any reimbursements by employees from these amounts. \r\n\r\nIf you held an interest in the property 6 years before your employee occupied it and they first occupied it after March 1983, use the value of the property at the time your employee moved in, rather than the original buying price.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the additional charge do the following: \r\n\r\ns1. Deduct \u00a375,000 from the cost of the accommodation. \r\ns2. Multiply what's left by the official rate of interest - if you only provide the accommodation for part of the year, use that proportion. \r\ns3.
