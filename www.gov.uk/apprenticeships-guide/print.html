  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Anyone in England who is over 16 and not in full-time education can apply for an apprenticeship. </p>

<p>Apprenticeships are work-based programmes that combine practical training with study. They take between 1 and 4 years to complete depending on the level of apprenticeship.</p>

<p>An apprentice:</p>

<ul>
<li>works alongside experienced staff</li>
  <li>gains job-specific skills</li>
  <li>earns a wage</li>
  <li>studies - usually 1 day a week - towards a related qualification</li>
</ul>
<h2>Levels of apprenticeship</h2>

<p>There are 3 levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intermediate – equivalent to 5 GCSE passes</li>
  <li>Advanced – equivalent to 2 A level passes</li>
  <li>Higher Apprenticeships – lead to NVQ Level 4 or Foundation Degree</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-you-get-as-an-apprentice"><header><h1>Part 2: What you get as an apprentice</h1>
  </header><h2>Pay and holidays</h2>

<p>You’ll be paid from the first day of your apprenticeship. The minimum wage for an apprentice is £2.65 per hour and applies to workers aged 18 to 20 and those aged 19 and over in the first year of their apprenticeship. </p>

<p>But many earn more. On average apprentices earn £170 per week and some around £210.</p>

<p>If you’re aged 19 or over and have completed the first year of your apprenticeship, you’ll be paid at least the <a href="/national-minimum-wage-rates" title="National Minimum Wage rates">National Minimum Wage</a> rate for your age.</p>

<p>Apprentices get at least 20 days of holiday per year, plus bank holidays.</p>

<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>Apprenticeships can lead to:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) at Level 2,3,4 or 5</li>
  <li>Key Skills qualifications, such as in communication or ICT</li>
  <li>a technical certificate, such as a BTEC or City &amp; Guilds Progression Award</li>
  <li>knowledge-based qualifications, such as a Higher National Certificate (HNC), a Higher National Diploma (HND) or a Foundation degree</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of apprenticeships</h2>

</article><article id="taking-on-an-apprentice"><header><h1>Part 3: Taking on an apprentice</h1>
  </header><p>You can use apprenticeships to train both new and existing employees. You can get funding to train apprentices.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>The amount of funding you can get for apprenticeship training depends on your sector and the age of your candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>aged 16 to 18 - you get 100% of cost paid</li>
  <li>aged 19 to 24 - you get 50% of cost paid</li>
  <li>25 years and older - you may only get a contribution</li>
</ul>
<p>This is paid directly to the organisation that provides and supports the apprenticeship - in most cases the learning provider.</p>

<h2>Apprenticeship grant for employers</h2>

<p>You may also be eligible for a £1,500 <a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Employers/Steps-to-make-it-happen/Incentive.aspx" title="Employer incentive grants">apprenticeship grant.</a> </p>

<p>These grants are available to help small-medium sized employers to recruit up to 3 apprentices for the first time, and are in addition to the training costs you get for apprentices.</p>
