  </header><p>Anyone aged 16 or over and not in full-time education can apply for an apprenticeship. </p>

<p>Apprenticeships are work-based programmes that combine practical training with study. They take between 1 and 4 years to complete depending on the level of apprenticeship.</p>

<p>An apprentice:</p>

<ul>
<li>works alongside experienced staff</li>
  <li>gains job-specific skills</li>
  <li>earns a wage</li>
  <li>studies - usually 1 day a week - towards a related qualification</li>
</ul>

<h2>Levels of apprenticeship</h2>

<p>There are 3 levels in England:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intermediate – equivalent to 5 GCSE passes</li>
  <li>Advanced – equivalent to 2 A level passes</li>
  <li>Higher Apprenticeships – lead to NVQ Level 4 or Foundation Degree</li>
</ul></article><article id="what-apprentices-get"><header><h1>Part 2: What apprentices get</h1>
  </header><h2>Pay and holidays</h2>

<p>Apprentices are paid from the first day of their apprenticeship.

<p>But many earn more. On average apprentices earn £170 per week and some around £210.</p>

<p>Those aged 19 or over who have completed the first year of their apprenticeship will be paid at least the <a href="/national-minimum-wage-rates" title="National Minimum Wage rates">National Minimum Wage</a> rate for their age.</p>

<p>Apprentices get at least 20 days of holiday per year, plus bank holidays.</p>

  </header><p>Apprenticeships can be used to train both new and existing employees. Employers can get funding to train apprentices.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>The amount of funding employers can get for apprenticeship training depends on their sector and the age of the candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>aged 16 to 18 - 100% of cost paid</li>
  <li>aged 19 to 24 - 50% of cost paid</li>
  <li>25 years and older - employers may only get a contribution</li>
</ul>
<p>This is paid directly to the organisation that provides and supports the apprenticeship - in most cases the learning provider.</p>

<h2>Apprenticeship grant for employers</h2>

<p>Employers may also be eligible for a £1,500 <a rel="external" href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/Employers/Steps-to-make-it-happen/Incentive.aspx" title="Employer incentive grants">apprenticeship grant.</a> </p>

<p>These grants are available to help small-medium sized employers to recruit up to 10 apprentices for the first time, and are in addition to the training costs you get for apprentices.</p>
