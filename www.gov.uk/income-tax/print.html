  </header><p>Income Tax is a tax you pay on your income. You don’t have to pay tax on all types of income.</p>

<p>You pay tax on things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>money you earn from employment</li>
  <li>most pensions</li>
  <li>interest on savings</li>
  <li>rental income</li>
  <li>benefits you get from your job</li>
  <li>income from a trust</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t pay tax on things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>income from tax-exempt accounts, like Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs)</li>
  <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
  <li>premium bond wins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Income Tax allowances and reliefs</h2>

<p>Most people in the UK get a <a href="/income-tax-rates" title="Income Tax rates and allowances">‘Personal Allowance’</a> of tax-free income. This is an amount of income you can have before you pay tax. If you’re aged over 65, you may get a high tax-free allowance.</p>

<p>The amount of tax you pay can also be reduced by <a href="/income-tax-reliefs" title="Tax reliefs">tax reliefs</a> if you qualify for them.</p>


</article><article id="how-you-pay-income-tax"><header><h1>Part 2: How you pay Income Tax</h1>
  </header><h2>Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Most people pay Income Tax through <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>. This is the system your employer or pension provider uses to take Income Tax and National Insurance contributions before they pay your wages or pension.</p>

<h2>Self Assessment tax returns</h2>

<p>If your financial affairs are more complex, like you’re self employed or have a high income, you may pay Income Tax and National Insurance contributions through the <a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns" title="Self Assessment tax returns">Self Assessment system.</a> You’ll need to fill in a tax return every year.</p>

<h2>Income Tax on savings and investment interest</h2>

<p>Income Tax is usually automatically taken from <a href="/apply-tax-free-interest-on-savings" title="Tax on savings interest">interest on savings and investments.</a></p>

<h2>Income that’s not automatically taxed</h2>

<p>If you get income that hasn’t been taxed (eg rental income), you must tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>If it’s more than £2,500 or you don’t pay tax through your wages or pension, you must tell <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> by filling in a tax return. If you don’t do this already, you must <a href="/register-for-self-assessment" title="Register for Self Assessment">register for Self Assessment.</a></p>

<p>If the untaxed income is less than £2,500, call <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>
