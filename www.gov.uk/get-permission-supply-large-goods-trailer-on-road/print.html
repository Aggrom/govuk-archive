  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You should apply to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) for permission if you supply large goods trailers for use on the road.</p>

<p>This applies to:</p>

<ul>
<li>large goods trailers or semi-trailers of any weight</li>
  <li>trailers (other than converter dollies) that have an unladen weight of more than 1,020kg</li>
  <li>any trailers to which the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1988/1478/contents/made" title="Goods Vehicle (Plating and Testing) Regulations">Goods Vehicle (Plating and Testing) Regulations</a> apply</li>
</ul>
<p>This is currently a voluntary arrangement but will become mandatory for <a href="/get-permission-supply-large-goods-trailer-on-road/who-needs-permission" title="who needs permission">certain categories of large goods trailers</a> from 29 October 2012. </p>


</article><article id="who-needs-permission"><header><h1>Part 2: Who needs permission</h1>
  </header><p>Any trailer supplier can apply for permission on a voluntary basis. </p>

<p>From 29 October 2012, you must get permission if you are a ‘final supplier’ of:</p>

<ul>
<li>new trailers manufactured in single or multiple stages</li>
  <li>special purpose trailers</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be an offence to supply these trailers without getting permission first.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p><strong>Fact checker: so what happens if someone doesn’t get permission? Do they get a fine? Why would someone get voluntary permission? Also, what are special purpose trailers? I think examples would be useful</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Final suppliers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>trailer manufacturers</li>
  <li>trailer dealers</li>
  <li>importers of new trailers</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re a dealer or manufacturer, you only have to get permission if it hasn’t already been applied for.</p>
</div>

<div class="advisory">
<p><strong>Fact checker: if I’m a dealer or manufacturer and permission hasn’t already been applied for, why hasn’t the manufacturer done it and can I just ask them? If it’s an offence not to get permission, do I report them?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>If you’re an operator using large goods trailers on the road, you don’t need to get permission - from 29 October, it should already have been given. You can check this by calling the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) helpline:</p>

</article><article id="how-to-apply"><header><h1>Part 3: How to apply</h1>
  </header><p>Apply using form TES1. If the manufacture of the trailer was completed after 29 July 2012, you need to support your application with evidence of <a href="/vehicle-approval" title="vehicle approval">vehicle approval</a>. If the manufacture was completed by 29 July 2012, you don’t need this.</p>

<p>The Vehicle and Operator Standards Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency">VOSA</abbr>) accepts the following evidence of vehicle approval:</p>

<ul>
<li>a European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<abbr title="European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval">ECWVTA</abbr>) Certificate of Conformity (<abbr title="Certificate of Conformity">CoC</abbr>) </li>
