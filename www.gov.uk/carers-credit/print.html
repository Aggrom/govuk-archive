  <li>you’ll be able to build up your entitlement to the basic State Pension and additional State Pension</li>
</ul></article><article id="eligibility"><header><h1>Part 3: Eligibility</h1>
  </header><p>To get Carer’s Credit you must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>aged 16 or over</li>
  <li>under <a rel="external" href="http://pensions-service.direct.gov.uk/en/state-pension-age-calculator/home.asp" title="State Pension age">State Pension age</a>

<h2>Breaks in caring and eligibility</h2>

<p>You can still get Carer’s Credit even if you have breaks from caring (up to 12 weeks in a row).</p>
