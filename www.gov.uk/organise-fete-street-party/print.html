  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="telling-your-local-council"><header><h1>Part 1: Telling your local council</h1>
  </header><p>Street parties involving residents from 1 or 2 neighbouring streets count as small events. If you’re planning a small event for neighbours, <a href="/apply-hold-street-party" title="Apply to hold a street party">apply to hold a street party</a> through your local council.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Tell your council 4 to 12 weeks before about your event.</p>
</div>

<p>Tell your council:</p>

<ul>
<li>the date and time of the party or event </li>
  <li>whether or not you want to close a road or section of road, and its name </li>
  <li>if the road is part of a bus route or used by through traffic </li>
  <li>a list of any properties or businesses affected </li>
</ul></article><article id="closing-a-road"><header><h1>Part 2: Closing a road</h1>
  </header><p>You’ll need to get <a href="/apply-hold-street-party" title="Apply to hold a street party">permission from your local council</a> to close a road.</p>

<p>Make sure that the emergency services can still get down the street if they need to.</p>

<p>If your party is on a bus route, the bus company will want to know about it in advance. </p>

<p>Some councils will contact emergency services and transport providers for you, but others expect you to do it.</p>

</article><article id="insurance"><header><h1>Part 3: Insurance</h1>
  </header><p>Most local councils don’t ask for insurance cover for a small residential street party or fete. </p>

<p>If your council thinks that insurance would be a good idea, costs start from £50. The Streets Alive website offers <a rel="external" href="http://www.streetparty.org.uk/insurance.aspx/" title="Streets Alive: advice on getting insurance for small street parties">advice on getting insurance for small street parties.</a></p>

</article><article id="licences"><header><h1>Part 4: Licences</h1>
  </header><h2>Alcohol and food</h2>

<p>A licence isn’t needed if you’re going to provide alcohol for free at your event.</p>

<p>To sell alcohol you’ll need a ‘temporary events notice’ which costs £21. You can get one from <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1" title="Find your local council">your local council.</a></p>

<p>Food can be served and sold up to 11pm without a licence. If you want to serve or sell it after 11pm, contact your council.</p>

<p>You don’t need a licence to give alcoholic beverages away as prizes, like a bottle of champagne for a winning raffle ticket, but there are rules about what can be given away. Contact your council for more information.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>You don’t need a music licence, whether the music is live or prerecorded, as long as your street party is a private party for residents.</p>

<p>If you play recorded music in public for an event that is <strong>not</strong> a private party (like a fundraising event), you must get 2 licences:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a rel="external" href="http://www.prsformusic.com/users/productionmusic/afml/Pages/default.aspx/" title="PRS for Music licence">Performing Rights Society (PRS) for Music licence</a> or call 0800 068 4828</li>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="http://www.ppluk.com/I-Play-Music/Businesses/Apply-for-licence-business/" title="PPL licence">Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) licence</a> or call 020 7534 1070 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Raffles and tombolas</h2>

<p>If tombola or raffle tickets are sold on the day and the prizes aren’t worth more than £500 in total then gambling regulations don’t apply. </p>

<p>If tickets are sold in advance or your prizes are worth more than £500 contact <a rel="external" href="http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1/" title="Find your local council">your local council</a> as you might have to register your raffle as a lottery.</p>
