Examples of this can include:\r\n\r\n- driving an overloaded vehicle\r\n- breaking the rules on drivers' hours and tachographs\r\n\r\nVOSA officers and the police can issue fixed penalties if you commit an offence. Some of these are graduated depending on the circumstances and seriousness of the offence.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nIf your vehicle exceeds its maximum permitted axle weight, the penalties are:\r\n\r\nVehicle overweight by | Penalty\r\n- | -\r\n5% to 10% | \u00a360 \r\n10% to 15% | \u00a3120\r\n15% to 30% | \u00a3200\r\nmore than 30% | court summons\r\n\r\nFor drivers' hours offences, the penalties are:\r\n\r\nMaximum daily driving time exceeded by | Penalty\r\n- | -\r\nup to an hour | \u00a360\r\n1 to 2 hours | \u00a3120\r\n2 or more hours | \u00a3200\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\nVOSA has published a guide to fixed penalties as well as a policy for road traffic offences, which includes a list of offences and penalty fine levels.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n[Download 'Guide to fixed penalties' (PDF, 996KB)](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/Transport_files/8001_VOSA_fixed_penalties_and_financial_deposits_0.pdf \"Download 'Guide to fixed penalties' (PDF, 996KB)\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n$D\r\n\r\n$D\r\n[Download 'Road traffic offences policy' (PDF, 1.55MB)](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/Transport_files/ENFORCEMENT_SANCTIONS_POLICY.pdf \"Download 'Road traffic offences policy' (PDF, 1.55MB)\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n$D\r\n\r\n##Endorsements to your driving licence\r\n\r\nFor some offences, you'll get points added to your licence (endorsements) as well as a fine. For example, if your vehicle has defective brakes, you'll be given a \u00a360 fine and 3 points on your licence.\r\n\r\n^If the offence is endorsable, you must present your driving licence within 14 days.^\r\n\r\n\r\n*[VOSA]: Vehicle and Operator Services Agency","slug":"the-fixed-penalty-scheme","title":"The fixed penalty scheme"}},{"table":{"body":"If you have a UK address, you'll have 28 days from when you're given a fixed penalty notice to either:\r\n\r\n- pay the fine\r\n- ask for a court hearing if you want to appeal\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, you'll get a 'conditional offer' instead of a fixed penalty notice. You get 28 days from the date of issue to pay the fine. After this, you could be prosecuted if you don't pay.\r\n\r\n###If you don't have a UK address\r\n\r\nYou'll have to pay a 'financial penalty deposit'. This will be either:\r\n\r\n- the total of all fixed penalty notices issued (if you want to appeal, you must do so within 28 days)\r\n- \u00a3300 per offence if you go to court (this depends on the seriousness and number of offences - you'll have to pay on the spot and and go to court later)\r\n\r\nIn both cases the maximum amount you'll have to pay as a deposit is \u00a3900. You have to pay this straight away - if you don't, you might not be allowed to drive your vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe money from deposits is used to pay any fixed penalties or court fines. \r\n\r\n^You'll be refunded any money left over from your deposit after fines have been paid.^\r\n\r\nIf you don't pay the deposit, your vehicle will be [immobilised](what-happens-if-your-vehicle-is-immobilised \"what happens if your vehicle is immobilised\").","slug":"fixed-penalty-notices","title":"Fixed penalty notices"}},{"table":{"body":"If you're stopped by a Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) officer or the police, they might immobilise your vehicle.\r\n\r\nThis might happen if you've committed a serious enough offence to get an ['immediate prohibition'](/roadside-vehicle-checks-for-commercial-drivers/roadside-prohibitions \"roadside prohibitions\"). \r\n\r\nAn immediate prohibition is used to prevent risks to road safety (eg an unroadworthy vehicle or a tired driver). It means you won't be able to drive your vehicle until the problem is sorted out. \r\n\r\n##When your vehicle could be immobilised\r\n\r\nVOSA or the police can also immobilise your vehicle at the roadside if an immediate prohibiton is issued for any of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- you've broken the rules on drivers' hours and tachographs\r\n- your vehicle isn't roadworthy\r\n- your vehicle is overloaded\r\n- you've been given a fixed penalty notice but can't or won't pay a financial penalty deposit\r\n\r\nNot all vehicles given an immediate prohibition will be immobilised. Special circumstances will be considered, eg:\r\n\r\n- the type of load you're carrying\r\n- if you're carrying passengers on a public service vehicle who'd be inconvenienced if it was immobilised\r\n\r\n##How your vehicle is immobilised\r\n\r\nVOSA and the police use a steel cable secured by a padlock to immobilise vehicles. It's fitted around the wheels of the vehicle and a warning notice is attached to the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe notice tells you how to get the vehicle released. You have to:\r\n\r\n- satisfy VOSA that the causes of the immediate prohibitions have been dealt with \r\n- pay an \u00a380 release charge \r\n\r\n^It's an offence to remove the warning notice or interfere with the immobilising device.^\r\n\r\nVOSA has produced a guide to vehicle immobilisation with more information, including advice on how to avoid it.\r\n\r\n$D\r\n[Download 'Guide to vehicle immobilisation' (PDF, 356KB)](http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/Transport_files/8003_VOSA_guide_to_vehicle_immobilisation_0511.pdf \"Download 'Guide to vehicle immobilisation' (PDF, 356KB)\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n$D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*[VOSA]: Vehicle and Operator Services Agency","slug":"what-happens-if-your-vehicle-is-immobilised","title":"What happens if your vehicle is immobilised"}}],"type":"guide"}
