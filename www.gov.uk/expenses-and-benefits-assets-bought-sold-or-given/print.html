<ul>
<li>computers</li>

</article><article id="what-to-report-and-pay"><header><h1>Part 2: What to report and pay</h1>
  </header><p>What you have to deduct, pay and report to <abbr title="HM Revenues &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> depends on how much your employee earns, and what you did with the asset, eg whether you bought it, sold it or gave it away. </p>

<h2>Selling or giving away an asset</h2>

<h2>Buying an asset</h2>

<p>If you buy an asset from an employee for more than its market value, the premium you’ve paid counts as earnings, so:</p>

<ul>
<li>add it to your employee’s other earnings</li>
  <li>deduct and pay <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and Class 1 National Insurance through payroll</li>
</ul></article><article id="work-out-the-value"><header><h1>Part 3: Work out the value</h1>
  </header><h2>Give or sell a new asset to an employee</h2>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year, the value is:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much the asset is worth second-hand when you transfer it</li>
</ul>
<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more a year, or if they’re a director, the value is the higher of:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much the asset is worth second-hand when you transfer it</li>
  <li>how much you bought the asset for</li>
</ul>
<h2>Give or sell a used or depreciated asset (not previously made available as a benefit)</h2>

<p>The value is how much the asset is worth second-hand when you transfer it.</p>

<h2>Give or sell a used asset that you’ve previously made available as a benefit</h2>

<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of less than £8,500 a year, the value is:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much the asset is worth second-hand when you transfer it</li>
</ul>
<p>If your employee earns <a href="/employer-reporting-expenses-and-benefits/reporting-and-paying" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more a year, or if they’re a director, the value is the higher of:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much the asset is worth second-hand when you transfer it</li>
  <li>how much the asset is worth when you first provided it as a benefit, minus any amount that was subject to tax or National Insurance while you were providing it as a benefit</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim21651.htm" title="Transfer of an asset previously available for use by a director or employee: example">See an example</a> of how this works.</p>

<h3>Exceptions for assets previously available as a benefit</h3>

<p>The value is calculated differently if you give or sell the following assets to a director, or an employee earning <a href="/employer-reporting-introduction-to-expenses-and-benefits/calculate-earnings-at-a-rate" title="at a rate">at a rate</a> of £8,500 or more:</p>

<ul>
<li>cars</li>
  <li>vans</li>
  <li>bicycles or cyclists’ safety equipment</li>
  <li>living accommodation</li>
  <li>computer equipment that you made available for private use when a limited exemption for computers was in force (until 6 April 2006)</li>
</ul>
<p>The value to use is how much the asset is worth second-hand when you transfer it.</p>

<h2>Buy an asset from an employee</h2>

<p>The value to use is the amount you pay over the asset’s market value.</p>
