</article><article id="tax-on-your-state-pension"><header><h1>Part 4: Tax on your State Pension</h1>
  </header><p>You may have to pay UK tax on your State Pension if you live abroad. This will depend on:</p>

<ul>
<li>your taxable income</li>
  <li>whether you’re classed as a ‘UK resident’ or ‘non-UK resident’ for tax purposes</li>
</ul>
<h2>UK residency</h2>
<p>The rules of UK residency are complex. Generally, you’re classed as a UK resident if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>spend 183 days or more in the UK in a tax year</li>
  <li>come to the UK for 91 days or more each tax year averaged out for up to 4 years</li>
</ul>
<h3>UK residents</h3>
<p>The rules are the same as for people living in the UK – you’ll only pay tax if your <a href="/tax-national-insurance-after-state-pension-age" title="Find out what your taxable income is">taxable income</a> is over a certain amount.</p>

<h3>Non-UK residents</h3>
<p>Non-UK residents don’t pay UK tax on their state pension but may pay tax in the country they live in.  But if you live in <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/si/double.htm" title="Countries with a 'double taxation agreement with the UK’">a country without a ‘double taxation agreement’</a> you’ll have to pay UK tax and may be taxed in the country you live in as well.</p>
