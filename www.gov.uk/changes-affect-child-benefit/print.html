  </header><p>You’ll need to tell the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible if a child you’re getting Child Benefit for dies. Tell them the date of death too.</p>

<p>You can do this <a rel="external" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_General?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" title="tell the Child Benefit Office a child has died">online</a> or through the Child Benefit Helpline:</p>

<div class="contact">
<p><strong>Child Benefit Helpline</strong> <br><strong>Telephone:</strong> 08453 021 444<br><strong>Textphone:</strong> 08453 021 474 <br>
8am to 8pm, Monday to Friday<br>
8am to 4pm, Saturday</p>
</div>

<p>The Child Benefit Office will let other parts of HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) know, so you only have to get in touch with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> once.</p>

<p>You’ll usually get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after the child dies. If they would have reached 20 before the 8 weeks are up, Child Benefit will stop then.</p>

<h2>If you haven’t yet claimed Child Benefit</h2>

<p>If the child dies before you’ve claimed Child Benefit you can still claim. You may get Child Benefit for up to 8 weeks from the date they died.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The longer you leave your claim, the less money you’ll get - so claim as soon as possible.</p>
</div>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Make a <a href="/child-benefit/how-to-claim" title="Claim Child Benefit">claim for Child Benefit.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attach a note with the date of the child’s death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your contact details and National Insurance number on the note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send the child’s birth or adoption certificate with your claim form (you don’t have to send their death certificate).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make a claim even if you don’t have the birth or adoption certificate - Child Benefit can only be backdated for 3 months. </p>

<p>If you don’t have the child’s birth or adoption certificate, you can <a href="/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate" title="order a new birth or adoption certificate">order a new one</a> and send it in later.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can’t claim Child Benefit if your child was stillborn.</p>

  </header><p>If you become responsible for a child following the death of their parent or parents you need to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_General?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" title="Report a change of circumstances to the Child Benefit Office" rel="external">Tell the Child Benefit office</a> straightway - include the exact date of death, where the child is living now and who’s looking after them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a <a href="/child-benefit/how-to-claim" title="Claim Child Benefit">Child Benefit claim</a> for the child (you must do this within 3 months).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See if you can claim <a href="/guardians-allowance" title="Guardian's Allowance">Guardian’s Allowance</a> if you’re bringing up someone else’s child or <a href="/widowed-parents-allowance" title="Widowed Parent's Allowance">Widowed Parent’s Allowance</a> if your partner has died.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>If your partner dies</h2>

<p>If your partner was getting Child Benefit and has died, you won’t get the payments automatically. They’ll stop on the Monday after your partner died. </p>

<p>If the payments were going into a bank account that was just in your partner’s name you’ll need to give the Child Benefit Office a new bank account to pay into.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll need to make a Child Benefit claim even if you were already an ‘alternative payee’ (ie getting Child Benefit paid to you instead of to the person who claimed it).</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re the person getting Child Benefit and your partner has died, the Child Benefit Office will carry on making payments into your bank account. </p>

<h3>If the child and your partner both die</h3>

<p>You can normally get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after the child has died if this happens. You must have been living with your partner when they died.</p>

<p>Apply for Child Benefit using form CH330A - you can <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_General?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="request form CH330A online">request this online.</a></p>

<h2>Outstanding Child Benefit</h2>

<p>The Child Benefit Office will also pay any outstanding Child Benefit due to the person who died (called ‘arrears’).</p>

<p>To apply for the arrears you must be 16 or over and one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>the executor of the deceased person’s estate</li>
  <li>the person who paid for the funeral</li>
  <li>the deceased person’s next of kin</li>
  <li>someone who’ll spend the money on the children</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to apply for the arrears within 12 months of the date the person died. </p>

<p>You can apply for the Child Benefit payments and the arrears using form CH330A. You can <a rel="external" href="https://directgov-online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CBO_General?dept-name=CBO&amp;sub-dept-name=General&amp;location=3&amp;origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk&amp;lang=eng" title="request form CH330A online">request this online</a> or by calling the Child Benefit Helpline.</p>
