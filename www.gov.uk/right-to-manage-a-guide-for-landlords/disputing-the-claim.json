If they\u2019re successful, you\u2019ll still own the building but they'll manage it. \r\n\r\nThis means they'll be responsible for things like:\r\n\r\n+ collecting and managing the service charge\r\n+ upkeep of communal areas (eg communal hallways and stairs)\r\n+ upkeep of the structure of the building (eg the roof)\r\n+ dealing with complaints about the building from other leaseholders\r\n\r\n^Qualifying leaseholders can use the Right to Manage for any reason - they don't have to prove the building has been badly managed.^\r\n\r\n##Right to Manage companies\r\nTo use the right, leaseholders must set up an RTM company and follow certain procedures. The RTM company can manage the building directly, or pay a managing agent to do it.\r\n\r\nAs landlord, you have the right to be a member of the RTM company and to vote on decisions. You get at least 1 vote. How many votes you'll get depends on how many flats you own in the building. \r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**  \r\nThere are 20 flats in the block. 16 are owned by leaseholders. 4 are owned by you and rented out on assured shorthold tenancies. You get 4 votes - 1 for each of the flats you own and rent out.\r\n$E\r\n\r\nThe RTM company must pay for any costs you incur during the management transfer process - even if it doesn't end up managing the building.\r\n\r\n*[RTM]: Right to Manage","slug":"the-right-to-manage","title":"The Right to Manage"}},{"table":{"body":"To qualify for Right to Manage:\r\n\r\n+ the building must be made up of flats (houses don\u2019t qualify)\r\n+ at least two-thirds of the flats in the building must be leasehold - with leases that were for more than 21 years when they were granted\r\n+ at least 75% of the building must be residential - eg if there\u2019s a shop in the building, it can\u2019t take up more than 25% of the total floor area\r\n+ you must live somewhere else if there are less than 4 flats in the block - unless the block was purpose-built as flats, rather than converted from another type of building\r\n+ any number of owners can set up an RTM company - but at least half of the flats in the building must be members of the company before it can actually take over management","slug":"qualifying","title":"Qualifying"}},{"table":{"body":"Normally, the leaseholders will contact you once they\u2019ve set up an RTM company.
