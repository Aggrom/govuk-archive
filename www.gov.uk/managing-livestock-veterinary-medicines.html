<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The use of veterinary medicines on farm animals is controlled under European law. This covers the initial authorisation of a veterinary medicine, its use on farms and how long after any particular treatment an animal or its food products may be used for human consumption.</p>

<p>The legislation aims to protect consumers by stopping unacceptable levels or concentrations of residues from veterinary medicines getting into the food chain. Maximum Residue Limits (<abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr>) and withdrawal periods are set as part of achieving this objective.</p>

<p>This guide outlines <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr>, veterinary medicine withdrawal periods, how to keep food for human consumption safe and the legislation that applies. It also discusses residue surveillance monitoring and inspection, as well as where to find up to date information such as the National Office of Animal Health (<abbr title="National Office of Animal Health">NOAH</abbr>) withdrawal period tables.</p>

<p>It also tells you how to identify veterinary medical products, keep records for the veterinary medicines used on your animals and how to reduce the development of drug resistance. Finally, it gives guidance on how to report an adverse reaction to a veterinary medicine and what to do if you want to use organic standards for your animals’ withdrawal periods.</p>

<h2 id="legal-background-and-identification-of-veterinary-medicines">Legal background and identification of veterinary medicines</h2>

<p>There are two major pieces of domestic legislation that apply to the use of veterinary medicines on farms and the control of residues. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Animals, and Animal Products (Examination for Residues and Maximum Residue Limits) Regulations 1997 as amended (the ‘Residue Regulations’)</li>
  <li>the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2009</li>
</ul>
<p>The Residues Regulations help Britain fulfil an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirement for all member states to have a system of surveillance for checking residues of veterinary medicines in foods of animal origin. They give authorised officers powers to:</p>

<ul>
<li>inspect and examine animals and take samples for analysis</li>
  <li>inspect records on farms</li>
  <li>carry out follow-up investigations on farms when residues above statutory or other limits are detected</li>
</ul>
<p>The Residues Regulations ensure that the process of authorising veterinary medicines is working correctly and veterinary medicines do not result in residues above the relevant Maximum Residue Level. The surveillance also helps detect if unauthorised substances are being used in food-producing species.</p>

<p>Under the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2009, it is an offence to give any veterinary medicine to your animals unless those medicines have a marketing authorisation for their use in the UK. Veterinary medicines whose active ingredients have been evaluated for residue safety can be used, and your veterinarian must keep records of their use. These regulations also allow your vet to give other products under a ‘prescribing cascade’. This is allowed when no medicines are available for an illness and the animal’s suffering must be prevented.</p>

<p>The cascade has three levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>level 1 - use of a UK-authorised veterinary medicine indicated for the same species but for another condition or indicated for use in another species</li>
  <li>level 2 - use of a UK-authorised human medicine or veterinary medicine authorised in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but not the UK. This requires a Special Import Certificate</li>
  <li>level 3 - specially prepared medicine made by a veterinary surgeon, pharmacist or suitably authorised manufacturer</li>
</ul>
<p>If a Veterinary Medicinal Product (<abbr title="Veterinary Medicinal Product">VMP</abbr>) is used outside its authorised uses under the cascade, a vet must specify an appropriate withdrawal period. The statutory withdrawal period for VMPs must not be less than:</p>

<ul>
<li>seven days for eggs</li>
  <li>seven days for milk</li>
  <li>28 days for meat from poultry and mammals, including fat and offal</li>
  <li>500 degree days for fish meat</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk/sis/default.aspx">Apply online for import and special treatment certificates on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (<abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h3 id="how-to-identify-vmps">How to identify VMPs</h3>

<p>The possession, administration to animals, or supply of unauthorised medicines is illegal under the Veterinary Medicines Regulations. Therefore, it is important to become familiar with the labelling of veterinary medicines so you can determine those that are legal, those that are not and those that are questionable.</p>

<p>In the UK, the labelling of an authorised <abbr title="Veterinary Medicinal Product">VMP</abbr> is in English. While companies are allowed to use multi-lingual labels, one of the languages must be English. VMPs also need to carry the UK marketing authorisation number. This can be identified by the letters Vm, Vh or PL. These letters are followed by a five-digit, an oblique ( / ) and a four-digit code. Marketing authorisation numbers will look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vm 09011/2001</li>
  <li>Vh 18705/2563</li>
  <li>PL49271/7753</li>
</ul>
<p>Products showing these codes or those with a prefix of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> - which are authorised throughout Europe - can be used.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk/pdf/leaflet_legal.pdf">Download guidance on how to identify VMPs from the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> website (PDF, 2.65MB).</a></p>

<p>Anyone who sells veterinary medicines should also remind their clients about all the responsibilities under these regulations, including the importance of record keeping.</p>

<p>You can get two laminated wall posters on residue requirements and regulation materials for use on your farm - one covers red meat while the other covers poultry and eggs. To order your copies, write to:</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-suitably-qualified-person">What is a Suitably Qualified Person?</h3>

<p>Suitably Qualified Persons (SQPs) are a group of professionally qualified individuals who are allowed to prescribe and/or supply certain VMPs under the Veterinary Medicines Regulations. To qualify as an <abbr title="Suitably Qualified Person">SQP</abbr>, you must take training and pass exams, then register with an approved registration body in order to practice. At this time, the Animal Medicines Training Regulatory Authority (<abbr title="Animal Medicines Training Regulatory Authority">AMTRA</abbr>) is the only register available for SQPs.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.amtra.org.uk/new_SQPs.html">Read information about how to become a <abbr title="Suitably Qualified Person">SQP</abbr> on the <abbr title="Animal Medicines Training Regulatory Authority">AMTRA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264475&amp;id=264476">Download the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr>’s guidance about how to become a <abbr title="Suitably Qualified Person">SQP</abbr> from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 263KB).</a></p>

<h2 id="food-safety-and-maximum-residue-limits">Food safety and Maximum Residue Limits</h2>

<p>The Maximum Residue Limit (<abbr title="Maximum Residue Limit">MRL</abbr>) is the highest level or concentration of a residue from an active substance that is legally permitted or acceptable in a foodstuff, such as meat, milk, eggs, or honey. The residue may consist of the parent substance that was administered to the animal and its ‘metabolites’. Metabolites are the substances that the animal has converted the parent substance into.</p>

<p><abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr> are set by the regulatory authorities after evaluating the results of a pharmacological and toxicological studies on the particular substance (see setting <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr> and withdrawal periods).</p>

<p>The withdrawal period is the period of time regulatory authorities have set between giving the animal its last dose of veterinary medicine, and it, or its food products, being allowed into the food chain. If you observe the correct withdrawal periods you should prevent consumers being exposed to residues from veterinary medicines at concentrations greater than the <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, for the same species and same veterinary medicine, there may be different withdrawal periods for the different foodstuffs. The withdrawal period is included in the veterinary medicine’s Summary of Product Characteristics (<abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SPC</abbr>), labels and package leaflet - which should be part of the product packaging.</p>

<p>The law relating to the use of veterinary medicines, keeping records of their use and following the prescribed withdrawal periods is there to ensure that <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr> are not exceeded and so consumers are protected. If a residue of a veterinary medicine is at a concentration below the <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limit">MRL</abbr>, then it does not pose a threat to consumer health. Therefore, supplying treated animals for slaughter before the withdrawal period has been observed or supplying food products from them that contain residues above the relevant <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr> are offences.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-correct-withdrawal-period">Finding the correct withdrawal period</h3>

<p>A full and up-to-date database of authorised veterinary medicines is available online on the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> website. This database includes the <abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SPC</abbr> for each product and the respective withdrawal periods. <a rel="external" href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/">Find the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> Product Information Database on the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/Compendium/Overview/-41030.html">find information on animal medicine withdrawal periods on the <abbr title="National Office of Animal Health">NOAH</abbr> website.</a> This information is also available in print format as an annual book. Both versions include product data sheets for animal medicines. However, not all pharmaceutical businesses are members of <abbr title="National Office of Animal Health">NOAH</abbr>, so the compendium does not list all authorised medicines.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-vmd-determine-withdrawal-periods">How does the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> determine withdrawal periods?</h3>

<p>Setting the withdrawal periods is considered to be a multi-stage, scientific process. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-livestock-veterinary-medicines">See our flowchart for the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> withdrawal periods.</a></p>

<p>The first three steps of this scientific process are conducted at a European level by the European Medicines Agency (<abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMEA</abbr>). The <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> is involved in this work as the UK’s Veterinary Medicines Regulatory Agency and member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use. Step 4 is conducted both at National and European levels and the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> is involved in the determination of withdrawal periods for all veterinary medicinal products authorised for use in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-identify-no-observed-adverse-effect-level-noael-samples">Step 1 Identify No Observed (Adverse) Effect Level (<abbr title="No Observed (Adverse) Effect Level">NO(A)EL</abbr>) samples</h3>

<p>A range of scientific studies are conducted on laboratory animals using the active substance that will be used in a <abbr title="Veterinary Medicinal Product">VMP</abbr> and from the results the highest dose (of the active substance) that does not cause observed adverse effects is identified. This is referred to as the <abbr title="No Observed (Adverse) Effect Level">NO(A)EL</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-determine-the-adi">Step 2 Determine the <abbr title="Acceptable Daily Intake">ADI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="No Observed (Adverse) Effect Level">NO(A)EL</abbr> is divided by an ‘uncertainty factor’, typically 100-1000. This uncertainty factor is to allow for extrapolation between species, differences between individuals and to compensate for other uncertainties in the data. The figure determined is referred to as the Acceptable Daily Intake or <abbr title="Acceptable Daily Intake">ADI</abbr>. The <abbr title="Acceptable Daily Intake">ADI</abbr> is the amount of a residue that is considered safe for a person to eat every day over a lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-establish-mrls">Step 3 Establish <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limit">MRL</abbr> is then set by dividing the <abbr title="Acceptable Daily Intake">ADI</abbr> amongst all the edible tissues (muscle, liver, kidney, fat/skin) and edible products, (milk, eggs, honey), taking account of:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much of a particular food may be eaten each day-  this is called the ‘food basket’</li>
  <li>how much of the active substance and/or its metabolites occur in each food substance, and how it is distributed in the animal’s body</li>
  <li>how and how much of the active substance is metabolised in the animal’s body</li>
  <li>identifying the appropriate ‘marker’ for intake calculations - this may be the parent compound or a metabolite - this is referred to as the ‘marker residue’</li>
</ul>
<p>A limit is then set for the marker residue in each edible tissue and edible product ensuring that the <abbr title="Acceptable Daily Intake">ADI</abbr> is not exceeded - these limits are the <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-determine-withdrawal-periods">Step 4 Determine withdrawal periods</h3>

<p>The time that must elapse after the last treatment of a veterinary medicine before an animal can be slaughtered, or the animal product can be taken for human consumption is calculated from data collected in scientific studies. These studies determine how rapidly the marker residue is depleted from edible tissues and edible products, and how quickly the levels of the marker residue fall to below the <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limits">MRLs</abbr>. Sometimes an ‘uncertainty factor’ is included in the determination to allow for inconsistencies in the data and differences between individual animals. This period of time is referred to as the withdrawal period. A withdrawal period is set for each <abbr title="Veterinary Medicinal Product">VMP</abbr> intended to be used in food producing species, so that the residues in each food will be below the relevant <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limit">MRL</abbr> and, therefore, ensure no risk to consumer health.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-veterinary-residues-in-food">Avoiding veterinary residues in food</h2>

<p>There are several simple steps that as a farmer, you can take to avoid unacceptable residues in food of animal origin.</p>

<p>Farmers should:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintain close communication with their vet about the safe and appropriate way to use veterinary medicines</li>
  <li>give animals the appropriate dose, based on actual body weights</li>
  <li>use only veterinary medicinal products that are authorised in the UK for the specific purpose, or that are prescribed under the cascade</li>
  <li>buy medicines from recognised sources, such as vets, veterinary pharmacies or animal health retailers</li>
  <li>follow the instructions for use on the product label and package leaflet, unless directed otherwise by a vet</li>
  <li>apply the appropriate withdrawal periods, as specified in the product’s instructions, unless the product has been prescribed under the cascade </li>
  <li>consider if there is a risk of cross-contamination between treated and untreated animals and their feed</li>
  <li>keep correct records</li>
  <li>ensure that any farmed animals sold are accompanied by their medicines treatment history and not send them if their treatment history is unknown</li>
  <li>not treat animals with medicines that are not authorised for use in food-producing species such as phenylbutazone, an anti-inflammatory medicine</li>
  <li>not use out-of-date medicines - it is an offence to supply an out-of-date medicine</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="residue-monitoring-and-inspection">Residue monitoring and inspection</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> operates a statutory surveillance programme that fulfils the UK’s obligations to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive 96/23/EC. This directive requires <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states to analyse food samples for residues of veterinary medicines, unauthorised substances and environmental contaminants. The programme covers red meat, poultry, salmon, trout, eggs, wild and farmed game, honey, and milk. Over 35,000 samples are collected for analysis each year. They are collected from farms, egg-packing stations, abattoirs and meat-cutting plants.</p>

<p>You can [read about the surveillance programme and see published results on the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> website].(http://www.vmd.gov.uk/fsf/residues_nonstat.aspx) The Veterinary Residues Committee (<abbr title="Veterinary Residues Committee (">VRC</abbr>) advises on the surveillance programme. <a rel="external" href="http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/vrc/">Find <abbr title="Veterinary Residues Committee (">VRC</abbr> information on the <abbr title="Veterinary Residues Committee (">VRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>The results of the surveillance programme indicate that the UK-authorised uses of veterinary medicines do not result in unacceptable residues. However, where the instructions for use are not followed, residues above the <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limit">MRL</abbr> can result.</p>

<h3 id="action-taken-where-unacceptable-residues-are-detected">Action taken where unacceptable residues are detected</h3>

<p>Under normal circumstances, action is taken where a residue of an authorised veterinary medicine is detected at a concentration above the <abbr title="Maximum Residue Limit">MRL</abbr>. An authorised officer, such as a vet or Fish Health Officer carries out a thorough on-farm investigation at the farm of origin to discover the source of the residue. The farmer and their own veterinary surgeon can then be given advice to help avoid a recurrence.</p>

<p>Where very high concentrations of authorised substances or unauthorised substances are detected, an investigation will be undertaken by an Investigation Officer from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>). The <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> may prosecute if there is sufficient evidence of misuse of an authorised product or use of an unauthorised substance. Animals on the farm that are shown to contain residues of unauthorised substances could be destroyed.</p>

<h2 id="using-withdrawal-period-tables-for-veterinary-medicines">Using withdrawal period tables for veterinary medicines</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="National Office of Animal Health">NOAH</abbr> withdrawal period tables are multiple A-Z tables. They contain information on all authorised veterinary medicines from companies registered with <abbr title="National Office of Animal Health">NOAH</abbr>, the manufacturing company, the species it is used for, the withdrawal period and any contraindications or usage instructions involved. You can refer to these tables to get an overview of some of the different products. It is very important that you check the latest information for each product you intend to use on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (<abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr>) website and follow the advice set out on the product label and package leaflet.</p>

<p>It is essential that the correct withdrawal period is observed. For the most recent information on the correct authorised withdrawal period, you should also <a rel="external" href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/">search the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> Product Information Database on the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/Compendium/Overview/-41033.html">Find full withdrawal period tables on the <abbr title="National Office of Animal Health">NOAH</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Each table shows a specific animal, meat or product with their corresponding withdrawal periods. The word ‘nil’ indicates that no withdrawal period is needed. The animals and their products include:</p>

<ul>
<li>cattle milk</li>
  <li>cattle meat</li>
  <li>sheep meat</li>
  <li>pig meat</li>
  <li>poultry meat</li>
  <li>fish meat</li>
</ul>
<p>Your vet should set a withdrawal period of at least 28 days for meat when intramammaries are used outside the Summary of Product Characteristics (<abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SPC</abbr>) recommendations, including when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the treatment period is increased</li>
  <li>the number of tubes is increased</li>
  <li>the interdose interval, or time between doses is shortened</li>
  <li>the treatment is changed to another product</li>
  <li>simultaneous dosing of other antimicrobials</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specific-considerations-for-milk">Specific considerations for milk</h3>

<p>Milk should be left out from the bulk sold if you have any cows that are in poor health such as those with:</p>

<ul>
<li>udder or reproductive tract diseases</li>
  <li>a diet that contains any substance that can make milk unsuitable</li>
  <li>low milk yields of less than two litres a day</li>
</ul>
<p>Milk withdrawals for goats and sheep will be found under the ‘notes’ column.</p>

<p>Your vet should set a withdrawal period of less than seven days for milk when intramammaries are used outside the data sheet recommendations, including when:</p>

<ul>
<li>the treatment period is increased</li>
  <li>the interdose interval is shortened</li>
  <li>the number of tubes is increased</li>
  <li>the treatment is changed to another product</li>
  <li>simultaneous dosing of other antimicrobials</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="withdrawal-periods-for-dry-cow-preparations">Withdrawal periods for dry cow preparations</h3>

<p>In the tables, some dry cow medicines are given two withdrawal periods. The ‘cattle milk’ column is the number of hours that follow a dry period that’s at least as long as the Minimum Dry Period (MDP). A second figure that shows in the ‘cattle milk’ column is the minimum amount of time between the product’s infusion into the dry udder and the cow’s calving date.</p>

<p>If calving takes place before the expected date, you will need to extend the withdrawal period. This is to combine the remaining expected MDP along with the milk withdrawal from the last treatment.</p>

<p>If you give dry cow medicines outside of the <abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SPC</abbr>, you should confirm the absence of antimicrobials before using the milk for human consumption.</p>

<h2 id="anthelmintic-and-antimicrobial-use-and-drug-resistance">Anthelmintic and antimicrobial use and drug resistance</h2>

<p>Antimicrobial and anthelmintic drugs play an important role in treating disease in animals. Antimicrobials are used to treat, control or prevent bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal-based diseases. Anthelmintics, or ‘wormers’, are used to treat various helminth species - also known as worms - such as the liver fluke, roundworm and tapeworm.</p>

<h3 id="antimicrobial-resistance-and-use-of-antimicrobial-drugs">Antimicrobial resistance and use of antimicrobial drugs</h3>

<p>Resistance occurs when the micro-organism that an animal is being treated for becomes resistant to an antimicrobial that normally kills it. The resistance can occur because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Micro-organisms may not have, or no longer have, the cellular sites where an antimicrobial will act. They could also have special enzymes that block the action of the drug, or a pump that pumps the antimicrobial out of the cell.</li>
  <li>A spontaneous mutation occurs that changes genes on chromosomes without adding new genes. As more antimicrobials are used over time, more resistance takes place as the mutated genes prevent the drugs from working.</li>
  <li>Mobile genetic elements known as plasmids, transposons and integrons - which carry antimicrobial resistant genes and can easily move from one cell to another - are active. Genetic information is shared and is the major way to develop multi-drug resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other ways the antimicrobial resistance can occur. Overuse and inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs may kill off bacteria, but if any of these micro-organisms have even small amounts of resistance, they can survive and continue the cycle of growing resistance.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-reduce-antimicrobial-resistance">How to reduce antimicrobial resistance</h3>

<p>There are a number of steps that you, as a farmer or vet can take to reduce antimicrobial resistance. You must:</p>

<ul>
<li>use good herd or flock health and biosecurity practices, hygiene, good nutrition and animal comfort</li>
  <li>use antimicrobials early in a disease when the clinical signs are first diagnosed</li>
  <li>use a narrow spectrum antimicrobial rather than a broad spectrum one</li>
  <li>if more than one antimicrobial is needed, use the one that is least important for human therapy and the least likely to select for resistance</li>
  <li>understand the product’s literature thoroughly</li>
  <li>follow the product’s labelling instructions, most importantly the dosing instructions - the amount of antimicrobial and how many times it should be administered</li>
  <li>perform sensitivity testing on causal bacteria against those antimicrobials of choice</li>
  <li>re-evaluate the benefit of any preventative antimicrobial use from time to time if no benefit is seen</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="anthelmintic-resistance-and-use-of-anthelmintic-drugs">Anthelmintic resistance and use of anthelmintic drugs</h3>

<p>Anthelmintic resistance is seen in sheep and goats and to a lesser extent, horses and cattle. There is growing multi-drug resistance in some areas that means farmers are left with solutions like clearing their land and restocking at a later time or moving into other business areas altogether.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-the-resistance-occurring">Why is the resistance occurring?</h3>

<p>There are numerous reasons as to why anthelmintic resistance is occurring. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>heavy use of the same or different anthelmintics on money farms</li>
  <li>continued use of anthelmintics which has caused a more resistant population of worms</li>
  <li>increase in the population of resistant worms</li>
  <li>some farmers using lower doses of anthelmintic drugs</li>
  <li>poor knowledge of the various classes of anthelmintics and the use of worm control strategies</li>
  <li>misdiagnosis of symptoms that lead to overuse or inappropriate use of the drugs when they’re not needed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-reduce-anthelmintic-resistance">How to reduce anthelmintic resistance</h3>

<p>In order to reduce anthelmintic resistance, farmers and their veterinarians should develop good worming strategies and practices. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>developing a health plan with a vet or Suitably Qualified Person (<abbr title="Suitably Qualified Person">SQP</abbr>) </li>
  <li>using the right drug at the correct dose for the specific worm, based on the advice of the veterinary surgeon or <abbr title="Suitably Qualified Person">SQP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>performing a slow annual rotation of the drugs used</li>
  <li>avoiding worming to a set pattern, but instead looking at current worming patterns and making adjustments based on veterinary or <abbr title="Suitably Qualified Person">SQP</abbr> advice</li>
  <li>performing regular faecal egg count testing and adjust the worming programme accordingly</li>
  <li>reporting any suspected adverse reactions to the drugs used to the vet or <abbr title="Suitably Qualified Person">SQP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>reporting adverse reactions to the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> using form MLA 252A - more commonly known as the ‘yellow form’ </li>
  <li>arranging specialist investigations to find out if this is a resistance problem or lack of efficacy of the drug used</li>
  <li>using ‘safe’ pasture developed from new pasture land, or hay or silage fields</li>
  <li>considering using non-susceptible adult stock that are bred for resilience to infestation in order to reduce worm populations in pastures and thus, frequent treatments</li>
  <li>treating all new animals with anthelmintics from two classes with the lowest known resistance levels</li>
  <li>quarantining the animals after treatment and then releasing them on to pasture land contaminated with worms to avoid importing resistant worms</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="record-keeping-for-veterinary-medicines">Record keeping for veterinary medicines</h2>

<p>You must keep records for your veterinary medicines, as this provides traceability for specific batches of products. You also have to have all your proofs of purchase for the veterinary products you have bought for your food-producing animals. Your vet must also provide you with information of any medications that you have given to your food-producing animals. You need to record the disposal of veterinary medicines that have not been used. These activities are required by law.</p>

<p>You must keep all records and proofs-of-purchase for at least five years following the administration or disposal of the product, even if the animals involved have been slaughtered or have died during that period. All records must be in writing, capable of lasting for a prolonged period of time, permanent and available on request by anyone who is in an enforcement capacity. You can also keep electronic copies of these records.</p>

<h3 id="adverse-event-reporting">Adverse event reporting</h3>

<p>An adverse event is any observation in animals or humans, whether or not considered to be product-related, which is unfavourable and unintended and which occurs after the use of, or exposure to, a veterinary medicinal product.</p>

<p>The science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects, or any other medicine-related problem, are known as pharmacovigilance. Adverse events include:</p>

<ul>
<li>adverse reactions in animals that occur after use according to label instructions and after off-label use</li>
  <li>suspected lack of expected efficacy after use according to the label instructions</li>
  <li>adverse reactions in humans after exposure to a veterinary medicine or treated animal</li>
  <li>adverse effects in non-target animals, humans or plants when exposed to veterinary medicine in the environment</li>
  <li>concentrations of veterinary medicine residues in tissues or food products of treated food-producing animals higher than the maximum residue limits when the recommended withdrawal period of the given veterinary medicine has been followed</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone can report an adverse event in reaction to a veterinary medicine to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (<abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr>), including:</p>

<ul>
<li>animal owners</li>
  <li>veterinary surgeons</li>
  <li>veterinary nurses</li>
  <li>pharmacists</li>
  <li>Suitably Qualified Persons</li>
  <li>marketing authorisation holders - they have a legal obligation to report serious adverse events to the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> involving prolonged severe clinical signs or death within 15 days following the receipt of information</li>
</ul>
<p>All suspected adverse events should be reported to the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> using form MLA 252A - more commonly known as the ‘yellow form’. You must use this form when a suspected adverse reaction is observed in animals or humans during or after the use of a veterinary medicine. <a rel="external" href="http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/adversereactionreporting/">Report an adverse reaction online or download form MLA252A from the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>All reports received by the <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> are recorded on a database. Additional information may be requested, such as laboratory or post mortem reports, in order to assist in determining the causal relationship between the veterinary medicine and the adverse event. All reports of suspected adverse events are reviewed by a group of <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> veterinarians, toxicologists, ecotoxicologists, immunologists and pharmacists, and all serious adverse events are further examined by the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC). Adverse events in humans are reviewed by the Appraisal Panel for Human Suspected Adverse Reactions to Veterinary Medicines, a sub-committee of the VPC. <abbr title="Veterinary Medicines Directorate">VMD</abbr> representatives also take part in the European Pharmacovigilance Working Party. This group monitors and harmonises adverse event reporting in the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</p>

<p>If there is a pattern of adverse events for a particular product, regulatory actions will be initiated. Such actions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>addition of warnings to the labels and literature of the product</li>
  <li>changes in the authorised use of the product</li>
  <li>batch or product recall</li>
  <li>removal of the product from the market until safety issues are resolved</li>
  <li>suspension of the right to manufacture the product</li>

<h3 id="keeping-records-for-horses">Keeping records for horses</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation defines a horse as a food-producing animal. Therefore, if you keep horses, ponies, donkeys, zebras and Przewalski’s horses for human consumption, you need to maintain records for your purchases of all veterinary medicines and their administration in the animals’ passports. The passports are important because they make certain that if the animals have been treated with certain medicines, they are not used as food for human consumption.</p>

<p>Also, since 1 July 2009, foals must have a passport and also be microchipped. This needs to be done before the foal is six months old or by 31 December in the year it was born, whichever comes later.</p>
