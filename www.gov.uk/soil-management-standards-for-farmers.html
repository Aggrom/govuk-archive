<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Farmers need to protect the soil from a number of possible threats - such as erosion, organic matter decline, compaction and contamination.</p>

<p>This guide explains the cross compliance soil management standards you must comply with in order to protect the soil, and gives guidance on how you can do this.</p>

<p>It also outlines good soil management practices for various farming activities and how to meet cross compliance requirements. These include arable farming, fruit and flower growing, restoring and recreating habitats for biodiversity, maintaining landscape features, and grazing and keeping outdoor pigs.</p>

<h2 id="soil-use-and-cross-compliance">Soil use and cross compliance</h2>

<p>To qualify for full payment under the Single Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr>) and other direct payments - eg the Environmental Stewardship schemes - you must meet all relevant cross compliance requirements. These requirements are split into two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statutory Management Requirements (<abbr title="Statutory Management Requirements">SMRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>requirements to keep your land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAECs)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 1 comprises the standards applying to soil management and protection in a revised Soil Protection Review (<abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr>). Under <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 1, you must carry out and submit by 31 December each year a <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr>. In your <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> you will need to identify whether any of the following occurs on your land and if so, how you intend to prevent or counteract its effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>erosion</li>
  <li>organic matter decline</li>
  <li>compaction</li>
  <li>salinisation - the accumulation of salts</li>
  <li>landslides</li>
  <li>contamination</li>
  <li>soil sealing - covering so that it is unusable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gaec-1---the-spr-and-all-standardsfor-soil-management">
<abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 1 - the <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> and all standards for soil management</h3>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 1 consists of a revised <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> and the three previous <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> standards that covered post-harvest management of land, waterlogged soil and crop residue burning restrictions.</p>

<p>Special requirements apply to certain forms of animal husbandry. </p>

<p>You must also include in your <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> any of your land not in agricultural production - ie land not in agricultural use on 17 May. In general, under <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> 2010 you are required to:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify and record any existing and potential problems with your soil</li>
  <li>assess and make a note of the soil types comprising your land and their particular risks of degradation</li>
  <li>choose and carry out measures to prevent and/or reduce the problems and risks you have identified</li>
  <li>review the risks and measures you are taking each year and make any changes that become necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of your <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr>, you are also required to:</p>

<ul>
<li>record access to waterlogged land and any actions you take to correct damage that occurs</li>
  <li>select and take appropriate post-harvest measures</li>
  <li>comply with the Crop Residues (Burning) Regulations 1993</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/293a8949ec0ba26d80256f65003bc4f7/e5b20880d03465a3802573aa0050128c!OpenDocument">find an overview of <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 1 on the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>You will however need to refer to the 2010 <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> and soil management handbooks for the full picture. If you have not received hard copies, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=145512&amp;id=145513">download the Cross Compliance <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> 2010 handbook from the Agricultural Document Library (<abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr>) website (PDF, 777K)</a> </li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=262248&amp;id=262251">download the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s 2010 edition of soil management guidance from the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website (PDF, 1.94MB)</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://www.wholefarm.defra.gov.uk">complete your <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> online on the Whole Farm Approach website (registration required)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="breaches-and-penalties">Breaches and penalties</h3>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> inspects farms that receive <abbr title="Single Payment Scheme">SPS</abbr> funding and other direct payments, to check they meet cross compliance requirements for soil protection.</p>

<p>If you do not meet <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> standards, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> can reduce your payments by 3 per cent - or more if you have breached the standards.</p>

<p>If your compliance requirements under certain Rural Development schemes conflict with <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> measures, the Rural Development scheme requirements will usually take priority. For guidance, you can contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Customer Service Centre on Telephone 0845 603 7777 or email them at <a href="mailto:csc@rpa.gsi.gov.uk">csc@rpa.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="environmental-stewardship-schemes">Environmental Stewardship schemes</h3>

<p>Farmers with soil management options in Environmental Stewardship schemes have greater improvements in soil management than through following <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> standards. For more information, see the guide on Environmental Stewardship: the basics.</p>

<h3 id="england-catchment-sensitive-farming-delivery-initiative-ecsfdi">England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative (<abbr title="England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative (">ECSFDI</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative (">ECSFDI</abbr> encourages farmers to improve soil structure so that it absorbs as much rainfall as possible. This minimises runoff and soil erosion, and so reduces diffuse water pollution from farming. See the guide on Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF).</p>

<h3 id="buffer-strips-to-protect-vulnerable-watercourses">Buffer strips to protect vulnerable watercourses</h3>

<p>While not mandatory until 2012 at the earliest, you may also want to introduce buffer strips next to vulnerable watercourses. You can get advice on buffer strip placement from Catchment Sensitive Farming officers, Natural England advisers, Campaign for the Farmed Environment and other farm advisers.</p>

<p>Payments for buffer strips are available under Entry Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>). For more information on <abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>, see the guide: Environmental Stewardship: the basics.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-good-soil-structure-and-organic-matter">Maintaining good soil structure and organic matter</h2>

<p>Compaction reduces space in the soil for water and air. There are a number of ways you can protect soil from compaction, such as by:</p>

<ul>
<li>not cultivating wet soil</li>
  <li>reducing the number of times the ground is compressed through a plough and press combination</li>
  <li>regularly checking fields for signs of compaction - particularly after wet weather, or during cultivation or harvest</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="soil-capping">Soil capping</h3>

<p>When finely textured bare soil is exposed to heavy rain, a cap or hardened surface will form. You should leave seedbeds as coarse as possible to protect soil from capping.</p>

<h3 id="soil-erosion">Soil erosion</h3>

<p>Wind and rain can erode exposed soil, however there are measures you can take to prevent this. Some of these measures include:</p>

<ul>
<li>working across a sloped field (whenever this is safe and possible). However, you must be aware of complex slope patterns that may channel runoff</li>
  <li>planting trees, hedges or grass buffer strips to prevent soil erosion and runoff into rivers and roads. This is a new <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> measure - buffer strips next to watercourses will be introduced in January 2012</li>
  <li>maintaining crop cover for as long as you can over winter</li>
  <li>increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil to make it less susceptible to erosion. When doing this, you must take account of waste regulatory controls</li>
  <li>protecting fields that are at risk of runoff and erosion, by avoiding sowing late harvested crops such as potatoes or sugar beet, or by harvesting them in drier conditions</li>
  <li>managing livestock so that they don’t trample pasture into wet, muddy patches (poached soil), and avoid out-wintering livestock on slopes where run off is likely to erode the soil</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measures-to-maintain-soil-organic-matter">Measures to maintain soil organic matter</h3>

<p>Arable farming can reduce soil organic matter. However, if not carried out properly it can damage the soil structure and increase the risk of capping, slumping and erosion. It can also decrease soil fertility.</p>

<p>You can add organic matter to soil by returning crop residues to the soil or introducing cover crops to your rotation. These are crops that replenish the soil with nutrients and organic matter. You can also replenish soil organic matter by leaving longer periods of fallow grass so the soil can recover from growing crops. You should also consider applying bulky organic manures to restore nutrients.</p>

<p>You will need a nutrient management plan which includes organic matter as well as inorganic fertiliser. Adding organic matter allows you to recycle nutrients, and means you use less inorganic fertiliser - which can save money. It also helps to protect the environment as excess nutrients do not enter groundwater, surface water or sensitive biodiversity habitats.</p>

<p>If you are in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone, you must be able to explain any nitrogen you add to the land. You must also not exceed the nitrogen limit you are allowed to apply to organic manures. You may only apply some types of organic manure during specific times of the year. For more information, see the guides on Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ) and managing nutrients and fertilisers.</p>

<p>If you want to add organic matter to your soil by importing waste organic materials, you must comply with the any Environment Agency exemptions or permits. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/sectors/32318.aspx">find environmental permitting application forms on the Environment Agency website</a>.</p>

<p>See the Environment Agency’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/permitting/default.aspx">guide on environmental permits</a>.</p>

<p>Cross compliance <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 6 applies if you plan to carry out any specified operation on land notified as a site of special scientific interest (<abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>). If your land is in an <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>, you may have to notify Natural England in writing and get their consent before carrying out operations that could affect the features and/or fauna in the area. See the guide on Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and historical monuments.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-biodiversity-and-landscape-features-by-managing-soil-of-land-not-in-agricultural-production">Maintaining biodiversity and landscape features by managing soil of land not in agricultural production</h2>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 12 sets standards to prevent unwanted vegetation from encroaching on habitats and land that is not in agricultural production or that is being used for non-agricultural activities.</p>

<p>Land not in agricultural production is defined as land on which agriculture is not being carried out on 17 May.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=249953&amp;id=249996">find Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) information on <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 12 on the <abbr title="Agricultural Document Library">ADLib</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Other changes in <abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> 12 have:</p>

<ul>
<li>removed the requirement to establish and maintain a green cover</li>

<h3 id="soil-management-in-habitat-re-creation-and-restoration">Soil management in habitat re-creation and restoration</h3>

<p>If you are part of the Environmental Stewardship scheme and are considering land for habitat re-creation and restoration, you will need detailed information about the soil on the proposed site. This will require accurate soil sampling and interpretation of the soil analysis.</p>

<p>To order a publication on the interpretation of soil analysis, you can contact the Natural England Enquiry Service on Telephone 0845 600 3078.</p>

<h3 id="soil-management-in-biodiversity-action-plan-bap-priority-habitats">Soil management in Biodiversity Action Plan (<abbr title="Biodiversity Action Plan">BAP</abbr>) priority habitats</h3>

<p>If you plan to improve a <abbr title="Biodiversity Action Plan">BAP</abbr> priority habitat such as existing heathland, or recreate heathland, you need to manage its soil carefully. Heathland soil often contains archaeological remains, which you must not interfere with.</p>

<p>To order a publication on protecting soils and the historic environment when restoring or re-creating lowland heathland, you can contact the Natural England Enquiry Service on Telephone: 0845 600 3078.</p>

<h3 id="soil-protection-and-landscape-features">Soil protection and landscape features</h3>

<p>The layout of your farm and landscape features can affect soil erosion and runoff. You need to take these into account when completing your <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr> for cross compliance purposes.</p>

<p>If you have chosen a soil management option in an Environmental Stewardship scheme, your plan will need to be more detailed than the cross compliance <abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr>. You can get help with this from Natural England, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group and Linking Environment and Farming.</p>

<p>You can apply to your local Rural Development Agency or Rural Development Programme for England to help with funding for soil management training. To find more information, see the guide on the Rural Development Programme for England. You can also see the guide on agricultural skills and training.</p>

<h2 id="managing-soils-for-arable-farming-and-fruit-and-flower-crops">Managing soils for arable farming and fruit and flower crops</h2>

<p><abbr title="Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition">GAEC</abbr> measures to protect arable land and land used for fruit and flower crops include:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintaining minimum soil cover to reduce the risk of erosion of arable land in winter</li>
  <li>reducing the risk of wind erosion in spring by sowing nurse crops - plants that help the main crop to grow - such as barley</li>
  <li>reducing the risk of soil capping - the formation of a hardened top layer - and breaking caps that form</li>
  <li>rotating crops to maintain good levels of organic materials in the soil</li>
  <li>managing crop stubble to maintain good levels of organic materials in the soil</li>
  <li>preventing soil saturation by good drainage, and avoiding using tractors or motor vehicles on the land if it does become saturated</li>
  <li>protecting boundary features and landscape features</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arable-farming-and-fruit-and-flower-crops">Arable farming and fruit and flower crops</h3>

<p>Compaction is likely to occur along old tramlines, tracks, headlands and gateways. You can remove this by cultivating or loosening the soil after harvest. You can reduce the risk of runoff and erosion by planting crops on land which is naturally free-draining, or has effective field drainage. To prevent sealing and runoff, irrigate uniformly, with application rates that are not too high and a droplet size that is not too big. Cultivating land to produce a rough surface as soon as possible after fumigating will help to protect against capping.</p>

<p>You can choose options under the Entry Level Stewardship scheme to help you reduce the risks of erosion.</p>

<h3 id="cereals-and-other-combinable-crops">Cereals and other combinable crops</h3>

<p>On soils vulnerable to capping and slumping, consider early drilling of autumn-sown cereals to establish cover and avoid very fine seedbeds. With shallow cultivation, take care to prevent soil compaction near the surface, and regularly loosen sandy and silty soils.</p>

<h3 id="potatoes-beet-vegetables-and-salad-crops">Potatoes, beet, vegetables and salad crops</h3>

<p>A wider bed system will reduce tyre compression damage. You can remove compaction following planting by cultivating headlands, gateways and ‘wheelings’ - compression from tractor or other tyres. Where possible, you should use tied ridges and dykes in furrow bottoms to improve infiltration and reduce runoff.</p>

<p>After harvest, you should consider rough ploughing to stop capping and slumping of sandy and silty soils.</p>

<h3 id="maize-and-other-forage-crops">Maize and other forage crops</h3>

<p>Early-maturing maize varieties will let you harvest early if you are planting on fields that are at risk of compaction, runoff and soil erosion. You should remove any wheelings and compaction by cultivating as soon after harvest or grazing as the weather allows.</p>

<p>You should try to minimise ‘poaching’ - wet, muddy soil - and runoff caused by forage crops and crop residues. You can do this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>limiting periods of access</li>
  <li>providing run-back areas</li>
  <li>starting at the bottom of sloping fields and back-fencing</li>
  <li>cultivating strips across the slope to reduce runoff - where practical</li>
  <li>avoiding slopes vulnerable to erosion and runoff</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="energy-crops">Energy crops</h3>

<p>Before planting energy crops such as short rotation coppice and miscanthus, you should remove any compaction - these crops do well on well-drained land.</p>

<p>Also, harvesting in dry conditions will help to protect the soil. During harvesting, you can use miscanthus cane as a mulch in gateways if required, and it makes sense to use existing tracks when travelling across nearby fields.</p>

<h3 id="fruit-crops">Fruit crops</h3>

<p>To minimise soil damage, you should plant fruit crops in dry weather and to grub out plants and trees when the soil is fairly dry.</p>

<p>Straw mulch will protect the soil between rows. You can also help to prevent erosion between rows of perennial crops by allowing vegetation to regenerate naturally, or by establishing grass.</p>

<h2 id="managing-soils-for-outdoor-pigs-and-poultry">Managing soils for outdoor pigs and poultry</h2>

<p>The keeping of outdoor pigs and poultry is considered a high risk activity in terms of soil protection and will require special attention in your Soil Protection Review (<abbr title="Soil Protection Review">SPR</abbr>) and in the measures you take to prevent or minimise potential damage.</p>

<p>Pigs and poultry kept outdoors can cause trampling and compaction of topsoil, erosion and runoff on slopes, which can lead to vehicle tracks becoming deeply rutted. As such the most relevant good agricultural and environmental condition measures for pig management address:</p>

<ul>
<li>erosion and poaching of land</li>
  <li>field drainage</li>
  <li>overgrazing</li>
  <li>the protection of boundary features</li>
  <li>the protection of landscape features</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advice-for-keeping-outdoor-pigs">Advice for keeping outdoor pigs</h3>

<p>You should avoid keeping pigs on slopes and slow-draining soils that will create runoff, and you should lay out paddocks and tracks to avoid channelling of water. You can catch runoff by establishing grass buffers. If runoff and erosion occur, you will need to move pigs to other paddocks.</p>

<p>Developing a rotation to move pigs on to fresh grass will allow the old grass to recover. After you move pigs to another paddock, loosen any compacted soil or cultivate as soon as weather permits.</p>
