<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Farmers have a duty to prevent the spread of disease - between animals, from animals to humans, and from humans to animals. Certain diseases are classified as notifiable. If you suspect an animal has a notifiable disease you must inform the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) immediately.</p>

<p>This guide explains how disease is spread, which diseases are notifiable, when and whom you must notify, and restrictions and disease controls you must implement. It also covers the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) contingency plans, inspections and contact details for useful organisations.</p>

<h2 id="controlling-and-eradicating-disease">Controlling and eradicating disease</h2>

<p>The Animal Health Act 1981 regulates the prevention, control and eradication of animal diseases. It provides emergency powers to respond to the outbreak of exotic diseases and covers aspects of disease control, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>eradication and prevention of disease</li>
  <li>dealing with an outbreak of disease</li>
  <li>powers of entry - for veterinary inspectors and officers of the minister</li>
  <li>seizure of infected animals</li>
  <li>slaughter and compensation</li>
  <li>disposal of infected carcases</li>
  <li>cleansing and movement of animals, personnel and vehicles</li>
  <li>empowerment of local authorities and enforcement</li>
</ul>
<p>Disease spreads more easily when hygiene is poor. A good routine is essential at all times, not only when there is an outbreak of disease.</p>

<p>You should also ensure you take appropriate biosecurity measures to protect your stock. For more information on biosecurity and prevention measures, see the guide on disease prevention.</p>

<p>Disease in animals can spread through any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>movement of animals, people and machinery between or within farms</li>
  <li>farm visitors - people and vehicles</li>
  <li>introduction of new animals</li>
  <li>contact with neighbours’ livestock</li>
  <li>shared farm equipment</li>
  <li>contamination by vermin and wild birds</li>
  <li>animals drinking from contaminated rivers and streams</li>
</ul>
<p>Vigilance and good stockmanship are important in the control and prevention of animal disease. You should monitor animals for signs of disease, and follow good farming practices. This will reduce the risk of disease and prevent the spread of it during an outbreak.</p>

<p>You must ensure employees and the public are safe if they are at risk of infection from exposure to notifiable diseases. However, livestock disease is not the only risk to employees and the public on farms. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/agriculture/index.htm">read about health and safety management in agriculture on the Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>It is your duty to prevent the spread of disease by immediately informing your <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> if you suspect a notifiable disease. </p>

</div>

<p>For more information on eradicating disease in specific species, see the guides on cattle health, pig health, poultry health and sheep and goat health.</p>

<h2 id="notifiable-diseases">Notifiable diseases</h2>

<p>If you identify - or suspect - that an animal has a notifiable disease you must report it to the veterinary authorities.</p>

<p>Diseases can be either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>endemic - these are continually present in Great Britain, eg tuberculosis in cattle, and scrapie in sheep</li>
  <li>exotic - these are not normally found in Great Britain, eg avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, swine fever and rabies</li>
</ul>
<p>Some animal diseases - called zoonoses - are infectious to humans. You must work with public health authorities to minimise the risk of these diseases. The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> works with private vets and owners of animals in Great Britain and encourages them to report any suspected infection. <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/zoonoses/common.htm">Find more information on zoonotic diseases on the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>Exotic notifiable diseases with internationally agreed eradication policies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>avian influenza - for more information, see the guide on poultry health</li>
  <li>classical swine fever - for more information, see the guide on pig health</li>
  <li>foot and mouth disease - for more information, see the guide on cattle health</li>
  <li>Newcastle disease - for more information, see the guide on poultry health</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/notifiable.htm">find a table of all notifiable diseases on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/a-z/bovine-tb/">find a range of publications on bovine tuberculosis (<abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr>) on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You should try to prevent notifiable diseases occurring at all. Introduce strict biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of animal disease, eg regular cleansing and disinfecting on and off your premises. For more information on prevention measures, see the guide on disease prevention.</p>

<p>Other measures to prevent disease can include careful restocking, practising good biosecurity, and being ready to take action to control specific diseases if you find them.</p>

<h2 id="notifying-your-aho-of-disease-outbreak-in-animals">Notifying your <abbr title="Animal Health Office">AHO</abbr> of disease outbreak in animals</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> is an executive agency of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and is primarily responsible for ensuring that farmed animals in Great Britain are healthy, disease-free and well looked after. Its key role is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>implement government policies aimed at preventing or managing outbreaks of serious animal diseases</li>
  <li>support the farming industry</li>
  <li>protect the welfare of farmed animals</li>
  <li>safeguard public health from animal borne disease</li>
</ul>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>
</div>

<p>You must also impose movement restrictions on your farm if you think your stock may be infected with a notifiable disease and you should contact your vet immediately.</p>

<p>When a notifiable disease is confirmed, The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> puts in place measures to control the spread of disease. This will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>restricting animal movements and swiftly examining and testing stock that may have had contact with infected animals or live in close proximity to them</li>
  <li>arranging for the slaughter and safe disposal of infected animals</li>
  <li>undertaking epidemiological work to identify the source of the disease</li>
  <li>establishing surveillance zones to look for further disease</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> may set up surveillance zones to prevent further spread until the disease has been controlled. <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/control/contingency-plan.htm">Find <abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s contingency plan for exotic disease outbreaks on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="restrictions-and-controls-following-disease-outbreak">Restrictions and controls following disease outbreak</h2>

<p>If a notifiable disease is confirmed amongst your animals, there are likely to be automatic restrictions placed upon your premises as part of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s contingency plan for disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>For information on preventing notifiable diseases, see the guide on farm health and safety: the basics.</p>

<h3 id="premises-restrictions">Premises restrictions</h3>

<p>When a notifiable disease is confirmed on a site, notices will be posted at all entrances to the premises, and the movement of people on and off the farm will be controlled - except certain people under licence. Rights of way through the premises may also be closed until the disease is brought under control. An approved disinfectant must be used to disinfect footwear, clothing and vehicles before entering or leaving the premises. For most exotic notifiable diseases, all susceptible animals on the premises are humanely culled.</p>

<h3 id="area-restrictions">Area restrictions</h3>

<p>When a notifiable disease is confirmed, a protection zone will be set up around the infected premises - and in most cases this will have a minimum radius of three kilometres. A surveillance zone will also be established, with a minimum radius of ten kilometres.</p>

<p>Controlled area restrictions are normally applied to restrict movement of animals outside the protection and surveillance zones. This occurs when there is - or is likely to be - a risk of spreading the disease more widely, eg if an infected animal is found to have passed through a market.</p>

<p>In the case of foot and mouth disease, rights of way may be closed in the protection zone. This is to control the risk of people using rights of way from coming into contact with the virus and carrying infection to other premises.</p>

<h3 id="restrictions-and-controls-during-an-outbreak-of-an-exotic-notifiable-animal-disease">Restrictions and controls during an outbreak of an exotic notifiable animal disease</h3>

<p>If area restrictions have been imposed on your premises, you should make only essential visits to any other livestock premises.</p>

<p>Strict biosecurity measures must be taken. For more information, see the guide on disease prevention.</p>

<p>Non-essential visits to premises with farm animals should be suspended.</p>

<p>You must make plans to ensure the welfare of your stock, and you should consider the likely implications of movement controls during an outbreak when preparing contingency plans for your business - eg making provision for keeping animals past their intended slaughter weight.</p>
