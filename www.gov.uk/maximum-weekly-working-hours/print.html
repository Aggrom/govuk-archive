  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>Workers don’t usually have to work more than 48 hours a week on average, unless they choose to.</p>

<p>Some sectors have <a href="/maximum-weekly-working-hours/weekly-maximum-working-hours-and-opting-out" title="Weekly maximum working hours and opting out">specific rules for their own workers</a>.</p>

<p>Normal working hours should be set out in the <a href="/employment-contracts-and-conditions" title="Employment contracts and conditions">employment contract</a> or written statement of employment details.</p>


</article><article id="weekly-maximum-working-hours-and-opting-out"><header><h1>Part 2: Weekly maximum working hours and opting out</h1>
  </header><p>Employers can’t force adults to work more than 48 hours a week on average - normally <a href="calculating-your-working-hours" title="Calculating your working hours">averaged over 17 weeks</a>. </p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>These rules don’t apply to jobs:</p>

<ul>
<li>where the working time is not measured and the worker is in control - eg managing executives with control over their decisions</li>
  <li>in the armed forces, emergency services and police - in some circumstances</li>
  <li>in security and surveillance</li>
  <li>as a domestic servant in a private household  </li>
  <li>where 24-hour staffing is required</li>
  <li>certain categories of seafarers, sea-fishermen and workers on vessels on inland waterways</li>
</ul>
<p>Other work sectors might have different rules on maximum working hours and workers should always speak to their employer.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re a trainee doctor the 48-hour maximum working hours rule applies to you, <a href="calculating-your-working-hours" title="Calculating your working hours">averaged over 26 weeks</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Opting out of the 48-hour week</h2>

<p>Workers 18 or over who want to work more than 48 hours a week, can choose to opt out of the 48-hour limit. </p>

<p>This could be for a certain period or indefinitely. It must be voluntary and in writing. It can’t be contained in an agreement with the whole workforce.</p>

<p>An employer shouldn’t sack or unfairly treat a worker (eg refused promotion) for refusing to sign an opt-out.</p>

<h3>Workers who can’t opt out</h3>

<p>Employers must not allow the following staff to opt out:</p>

<ul>
<li>workers in the road transport industry, eg delivery drivers</li>
  <li>workers on ships or boats</li>
  <li>airline staff</li>
  <li>other staff who travel in and operate vehicles covered by EU rules on drivers’ hours, eg bus conductors</li>
  <li>security guards on a vehicle carrying high-value goods</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cancelling an opt-out agreement</h3>
<p>A worker can cancel their opt-out agreement whenever they want - even if it’s part of their employment contract.</p>

<p>They must give their employer at least 7 days’ notice. This could be longer (up to 3 months) if the worker previously agreed this in the written opt-out agreement with the employer.</p>

<p>The employer isn’t allowed to force a worker to cancel their opt-out agreement.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example of opt-out agreement:</strong></p>

<p>I [worker’s name] agree that I may work for more than an average of 48 hours a week. If I change my mind, I will give my employer [amount of time - up to 3 months’] notice in writing to end this agreement.
Signed……………………………………
Dated…………………………………….</p>

<h2>16 and 17 year olds</h2>

<p>16 and 17 year olds can’t normally work more than 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week.</p>

<p>The hours can’t be averaged out for 16 and 17 year olds. There is also no opt-out which means that they can’t work longer hours even if they want to.</p>

</article><article id="calculating-your-working-hours"><header><h1>Part 3: Calculating your working hours</h1>
  </header><p>Only certain hours count as work when weekly hours are calculated.</p>

<h2>What counts as work</h2>

<p>As well as doing the normal duties, a working week includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>job-related training</li>
  <li>job-related travelling time, eg sales reps</li>
  <li>working lunches, eg business lunches</li>
  <li>time spent actually working abroad in some cases</li>
  <li>paid and some unpaid overtime</li>
  <li>time spent on call at the workplace</li>
  <li>any other time that is treated as ‘working time’ under a contract </li>
</ul>
<h2>What doesn’t count as work</h2>

<p>A working week doesn’t include:</p>

<ul>
<li>breaks when no work is done, eg lunch breaks</li>
  <li>normal travel to and from work</li>
  <li>time on call away from the workplace</li>
  <li>evening and day-release classes not related to work</li>
  <li>travelling outside of normal working hours</li>
  <li>unpaid overtime a worker has volunteered for, eg staying late to finish something off</li>
  <li>paid or unpaid holiday</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time used to calculate average hours</h2>

<p>The average working hours are calculated over a ‘reference’ period. This is normally a 17-week period. </p>

<p>Someone can work more than 48 hours in 1 week, so long as the average over 17 weeks  is less than 48 hours a week.</p>

<p>Some jobs have different reference periods:</p>

<ul>
<li>doctors in training have a 26-week reference period  </li>
  <li>the offshore sector has a 52-week reference period  </li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Days when a worker is off (eg paid leave, time off sick) don’t count towards the reference period.</p>
</div>

<h2>Working hours if someone has more than one job</h2>

<p>If someone works for more than one employer, the amount of combined hours shouldn’t be more than 48 hours on average a week.</p>

<p>Workers with more than one job could either:</p>

<ul>
<li>consider signing an opt-out agreement if their total time worked is more than 48 hours</li>
  <li>reduce their hours to meet the 48-hour limit</li>
