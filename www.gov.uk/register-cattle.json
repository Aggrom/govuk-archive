The relevant body must receive the application within a total of 27 days from birth.\r\n\r\nAll identification tags must be in the correct format. They must be approved, show the letters 'UK' followed by your 12 digit number that is unique to the herd and the animal. Unused tags must be securely stored. You must not alter, deface or obliterate tags.\r\n\r\nYou will normally receive a passport within\u00a07 days of applying.\r\n\r\nIf you import an animal from within the European Union (EU), you must apply for a passport within 15 days of the animal arriving at the holding destination.\r\n\r\nIf you import an animal from outside the EU, you must apply for a passport within 15 days\u00a0of tagging the animal.\r\n\r\nYou must submit a passport application for bison calves within seven days of birth, although you can defer their tagging for up to nine months if you do not move them from their holding of birth, or separate them from their dam.\r\n\r\n##Conditions\r\n\r\nYou must keep identification documents and produce them on request.

There is an obligation in the licence for keepers to inspect any cattle being moved for signs of foot and mouth disease.

If you do find evidence of disease, the cattle movement licence is invalid, and you are not allowed to move any animal kept on the premises.\r\n* Do not move untagged cattle from a holding.\r\n* Replace all removed, lost or illegible tags within 28 days.\r\n* Do not apply unapproved tags or duplicate identification codes.\r\n\r\nYou must not falsely alter or deface an identification document, obstruct an inspector or fail to provide assistance, information, documents or records, or provide false/misleading information.
