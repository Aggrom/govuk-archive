  <p>Notes</p>
</header><article id="overview"><header><h1>Part 1: Overview</h1>
  </header><p>You pay National Insurance contributions to build up your entitlement to certain state benefits, including the State Pension. </p>

<p>You pay National Insurance if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>16 or over</li>
  <li>an employee earning above £146 a week  </li>
  <li>self employed making a profit over £5,995 a year</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact amount you pay depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much you earn</li>
  <li>whether you’re employed or self-employed</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also want to pay <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions" title="Voluntary contributions">voluntary contributions</a> to make up for gaps in your National Insurance record. For example, you can have a gap when you weren’t working and didn’t get any state benefits.  </p>

<h2>When you stop paying</h2>

<p>If you’re employed, you stop paying Class 1 National Insurance when you reach the <a rel="external" href="http://pensions-service.direct.gov.uk/en/state-pension-age-calculator/home.asp" title="State Pension age">State Pension age.</a> </p>

<p>If you’re self-employed you stop paying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Class 2 National Insurance when you reach State Pension age</li>
  <li>Class 4 National Insurance from the start of the tax year after the one in which you reach State Pension age</li>
</ul></article><article id="your-national-insurance-number"><header><h1>Part 2: Your National Insurance number</h1>
  </header><p>Your National Insurance number makes sure your National Insurance contributions and tax are only recorded against your name. </p>

<p>It’s made up of letters and numbers and never changes. </p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can apply to <a href="/national-insurance-number" title="get a National Insurance number">get a National Insurance number</a> if you don’t have one.</p>

<h2>Who uses your National Insurance number</h2>

<p>These organisations need to know what your number is:</p>

<ul>
<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>your employer</li>
  <li>the Department for Work and Pensions (which includes Jobcentre Plus and the Pension, Disability and Carers Service), if you claim state benefits, or in Northern Ireland the Department for Social Development </li>
  <li>your local council, if you claim Housing Benefit, or the Northern Ireland Housing Executive</li>
  <li>the Student Loan Company, if you apply for a student loan</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> provider, if you open an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>To prevent identity fraud, keep your National Insurance number safe and don’t give it to anyone who doesn’t need it.</p>

</article><article id="how-much-national-insurance-you-pay"><header><h1>Part 3: How much National Insurance you pay</h1>
  </header><h2>If you’re employed</h2>

<p>You pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions. The rates are:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you earn between £107 and £146 you’re automatically covered for State Pension and benefits</li>
  <li>12% on your weekly earnings between £146 and £817  </li>
  <li>an extra 2% on any earnings over £817 </li>
</ul>
<p>You pay National Insurance with your tax. Your employer will take it from your wages before you get paid.</p>

<p>If you’re a director of a limited company, you may also be your own employee and pay National Insurance Class 1 through your <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> payroll. If your company’s profits are above a certain amount you might also have to pay Class 2 and 4 - see ‘If you’re self-employed’.</p>

<h2>If you’re self-employed</h2>

<p>You’re responsible for paying your own National Insurance. How much you pay depends on your profits:</p>

<p>You <a href="/pay-class-2-national-insurance" title="pay class 2 national insurance">pay Class 2</a> either via direct debit once a month or every 6 months or you can ask <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to bill you twice a year. Your Class 4 contributions will be paid with your Income Tax. You can set up your payments when you <a href="/register-for-self-assessment" title="register for Self Assessment">register for Self Assessment</a> or <a href="/pay-class-2-national-insurance" title="pay class 2 national insurance">change how you pay</a>.</p>

<h2>If you’re employed and self-employed</h2>

<p>You might be an employee but also do self-employed work. In this case your employer will take care of your Class 1 payments and you have to pay your Class 2 and 4 payments like any other self-employed person. How much you pay when <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/working/intro/employed-selfemployed.htm" title="employed and self-employed">employed and self-employed</a> depends on your combined income from all your jobs.</p>

<h2>If you’re a share fisherman</h2>
<p>If you’re a share fisherman - ie you’re employed on a British fishing boat but not under a contract of service - you pay a different Class 2 rate. In 2012 to 2013 the rate is £3.30 a week. This contributes towards the basic State Pension, the normal range of benefits for self-employed people, plus Jobseeker’s Allowance.</p>

<h2>Reduced rates</h2>
<p>There are reduced rates for some <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm" title="married women and widows">married women and widows</a> and if you have a separate, ‘contracted out’ pension scheme through your employer.</p>

<h2>Voluntary contributions</h2>

<p>You can pay <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions" title="voluntary National Insurance contributions">voluntary National Insurance contributions</a> to cover or avoid gaps in your National Insurance record. You may have gaps from times when you didn’t pay contributions, eg you weren’t working and not claiming benefits.</p>
