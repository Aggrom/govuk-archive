<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Animal by-products (<abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>) are entire animal bodies, parts of animals, products of animal origin or other products obtained from animals that are not fit or intended for human consumption. They must be dealt with in accordance with strict regulations designed to prevent harm to people, animals and the environment. <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> are categorised by the risks they pose and the methods used to deal with them.</p>

<p>This guide explains the different categories of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>, how they can be collected, stored and transported, and how they can be treated, used and disposed of. Your Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) can give advice on dealing with <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Note that EU rules for <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> are to be revised and will apply as of 4 March 2011.</p>

<h2 id="types-and-treatments-of-animal-by-products">Types and treatments of animal by-products</h2>

<p><abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> are made up of:</p>

<ul>
<li>whole animal carcasses</li>
  <li>parts of carcasses</li>
  <li>products of animal origin</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>catering waste</li>
  <li>used cooking oil</li>
  <li>former foodstuffs</li>
  <li>butcher and slaughterhouse waste</li>
  <li>blood</li>
  <li>feathers</li>
  <li>wool</li>
  <li>hides and skins</li>
  <li>fallen stock - see the guide on fallen stock </li>
  <li>pet animals</li>
  <li>zoo and circus animals</li>
  <li>hunt trophies</li>
  <li>manure</li>
  <li>ova</li>
  <li>embryos and semen</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> are classified into three categories - based on their potential risk to animals, the public and the environment.</p>

<h3 id="category-1-abps">Category 1 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>These are very high-risk materials, eg animal carcasses or parts of carcasses suspected or confirmed as being infected by a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. You must dispose of them by incineration or processing (rendering) followed by incineration. Specified Risk Material - such as the brain and spinal cord of cattle - is also Category 1 but can be destroyed by incineration or rendering to a required standard. For more information, see the guide on disease prevention. Pet, zoo, circus and experimental animals are also classified as Category 1, although you are allowed to bury your pet animals. You can contact your local authority for guidance on pet burials. </p>

<p>From 4 March 2011 zoos can apply for an authorisation from the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> to allow them to feed Category 1 fallen stock - such as entire deceased antelope, zebras, etc - to their carnivorous animals (eg big cats).</p>

<p>International catering waste, and wild animals (when suspected of being infected with disease communicable to humans or animals) are also Category 1.</p>

<h3 id="category-2-abps">Category 2 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>These are other high-risk materials including:</p>

<ul>
<li>fallen stock</li>
  <li>manure</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> that are potentially contaminated, for example, animals that died on the farm, have been killed on the farm as part of disease control measures, or are at risk of residues of veterinary drugs</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guide on disease notification and restrictions. </p>

<p>You can dispose of Category 2 materials by incineration and rendering, or at an authorised landfill site if processed to the required standard. You are permitted to recycle some Category 2 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> for uses other than feed after appropriate treatment, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>biogas</li>
  <li>composting</li>
  <li>oleo-chemical products</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the guide on minimising farm waste, composting and recycling.</p>

<h3 id="category-3-abps">Category 3 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>These are the lowest-risk materials, they include:</p>

<ul>
<li>raw meat that has passed meat inspection (but is not intended for human consumption)</li>
  <li>material such as feathers, eggshells,  wool, horns, etc from animals that do not show any signs of disease communicable through that material to humans or animals</li>
  <li>waste from food manufacturers and retailers</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use or dispose of Category 3 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> in various ways, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>incineration</li>
  <li>rendering</li>
  <li>authorised landfill, following processing</li>
  <li>composting</li>
  <li>anaerobic digestion</li>
  <li>being used in an approved petfood plant</li>
  <li>being used in a technical plant</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disposing-of-abps">Disposing of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You must dispose of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> using the appropriate method for the category of waste. These methods include:</p>

<ul>
<li>rendering or incinerating</li>
  <li>landfill - eg for catering waste and certain former foodstuffs</li>
  <li>composting</li>
  <li>biogas generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Catering waste must not be fed to farmed animals. <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/byproducts/documents/dispguide.pdf">Download a guide to disposal of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> in catering waste from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 585K)</a>.</p>

<p>You can dispose of former foodstuffs, such as out-of-date produce, by:</p>

<ul>
<li>incineration</li>
  <li>rendering</li>
  <li>use in petfood </li>
  <li>composting</li>
  <li>use in biogas plants</li>
</ul>
<p>From 4 March 2011 food manufacturers or retailers who generate small quantities of <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> waste (i.e. less than 20kg per week of low-risk Category 3 food waste such as raw meat and fish) can now dispose of this outside of the <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> controls.</p>

<p>Some foods can be disposed of at approved landfill sites, as long as they have been heat-treated first. <a rel="external" href="http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/byproducts/documents/wasteleaflet.pdf">Download a guide to the disposal of former foodstuffs from retail premises from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 585K)</a>. </p>

<p>For more information about <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> classification and disposal, contact your <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. </p>

<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="premises-for-processing-animal-by-products">Premises for processing animal by-products</h2>

<p>Premises that receive, handle, use, treat or destroy <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> must be approved under the <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> Regulations.</p>

<p>There are various premises that handle <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> and require approval, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>processing (rendering) plants</li>
  <li>incineration plants that only incinerate <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>oleo-chemical plants</li>
  <li>biogas plants</li>
  <li>composting plants</li>
  <li>technical plants</li>
  <li>petfood plants</li>
  <li>collection centres and final user plant</li>
  <li>intermediate and storage plants</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>, which is an agency of <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, is responsible for inspecting and approving premises for treating <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> in the UK, except Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>For information and advice about approved premises and local disposal routes for <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>, you can contact your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. </p>

<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="types-of-approved-premises-for-abps">Types of approved premises for <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Different categories of <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> are dealt with in different types of premises.</p>

<p>Premises should state which categories of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> they handle:</p>

<ul>
<li>intermediate plants - hold and may prepare raw <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> before transportation to their final destinations. Category 1 and 2 intermediate plants may also perform tasks such as hide and skin removal or post mortems</li>
  <li>storage plants - store processed <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>, such as meat- and bone-meal and tallow, before use or destruction</li>
  <li>incineration plants - only dispose of animal carcasses or parts of carcasses - these plants require approval under the <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> regulations</li>
  <li>processing (rendering) plants - cook <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> at high temperatures and pressures to remove water and separate fat (tallow) from protein material, which may be dried to produce meat- and bone-meal</li>
  <li>oleo-chemical plants - none are approved in England</li>
  <li>composting plants - carry out composting of catering waste and Category 3 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>biogas plants - carry out biogas treatments for catering waste and Category 3 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>petfood plants - use only Category 3 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> as raw ingredients, they cannot use <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> that pose a health risk or which come from animals that have died on farm</li>
  <li>technical plants - use <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> to produce products such as paint, tyres, and strings for musical instruments</li>
  <li>collection centres - collect and treat fallen stock and other <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> for final users, where <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> are fed to animals, such as hunt kennels, zoos and maggot farms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transportation-of-animal-by-products">Transportation of animal by-products</h2>

<p><abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> must be collected and carried in leakproof, covered containers or vehicles, or sealed new packaging, and kept separately from other categories of by-product.</p>

<p>There are restrictions on who can transport <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>, and the locations at which they can be disposed of. In addition, special care must be taken when loading and unloading <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>From 4 March 2011 operators wishing to transport <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> need to be registered to do so. Contact your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office for details.</p>

<p>Anyone transporting <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> other than manure must complete a commercial document before transportation. There is no standard commercial document - it can be an invoice, consignment or transfer note - but you must record the origin, quantity and description of the <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr>, the date it is being transported, the carrier and the destination. The completed form stays with the <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> during transit and is given to the receiver. The sender and carrier must keep copies for at least two years.</p>

<p>For more information about Commercial Documents, you can contact your <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. </p>

<h2 id="disposal-of-fallen-stock">Disposal of fallen stock</h2>

<p>The disposal of fallen stock and <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> not intended for human consumption is regulated in England by the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005.</p>

<p>‘Fallen stock’ can be any animal that has:</p>

<ul>
<li>died of natural causes or disease on the farm</li>
  <li>been killed on the farm for reasons other than human consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>The National Fallen Stock Company (<abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr>) is a non-profit organisation that runs the voluntary National Fallen Stock Scheme for the collection and disposal of fallen stock.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on fallen stock.</p>

<h3 id="biosecurity-and-fallen-stock">Biosecurity and fallen stock</h3>

<p>Biosecurity measures are of paramount importance in case the animal has died of a contagious and thus notifiable disease. You must remove any fallen stock to an area to which other livestock and wildlife have no access. Where possible, eg poultry, young stock, small ruminants, you should store the animals until collection in leak proof, vented and covered containers.</p>

<p>You must immediately notify your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office if you suspect your stock may be infected with or have died from a notifiable disease, or you have had sudden/unexpected deaths in your livestock.</p>

<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>For more information on biosecurity, see the guide on controlling disease: the basics and the guide on disease notification and restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-fallen-stock">Disposing of fallen stock</h3>

<p>You must not bury or burn fallen stock in the open, other than in exceptional circumstances - eg the outbreak of a notifiable disease - as this risks spreading disease through groundwater or air pollution.</p>

<p>When you find fallen stock, you should arrange for it to go to an approved:</p>

<ul>
<li>knacker</li>
  <li>hunt kennel</li>
  <li>incinerator</li>
  <li>renderer</li>
  <li>maggot farm</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do this either by private arrangement or under the National Fallen Stock Scheme. For more information, you can contact the <abbr title="National Fallen Stock Company">NFSCo</abbr> Helpline on Telephone: 0845 054 8888.</p>

<p>To find an approved knacker, hunt kennel, incinerator, maggot farm or renderer, you should contact your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office. You must immediately contact the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> if you think an animal has died of a notifiable disease.</p>

<p>For contact details of your local <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> office <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/postcode.asp">use the postcode search tool on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="fallen-cattle-aged-over-48-months">Fallen cattle aged over 48 months</h3>

<p>Fallen cattle over 48 months of age must be tested for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (<abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>) - a form of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (<abbr title="Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy">TSE</abbr>). Fallen cattle over 24 months that were born outside Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK must also be tested for <abbr title="Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy">BSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must contact a collector within 24 hours of your animal’s death, to arrange delivery to an approved sampling site within 72 hours. If you are delivering the carcass yourself, you must contact an approved sampling site to agree this within 24 hours and must deliver the carcass within 72 hours of the animal’s death.</p>

<p>Fallen cattle aged 48 months or under should be disposed of in accordance with APB legislation.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/publications/managing-disease/TSE_%20approved_%20plants.pdf">download a list of approved premises for <abbr title="Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy">TSE</abbr> testing of fallen cattle from the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website (PDF, 51K)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="composting-and-incinerating-animal-by-products">Composting and incinerating animal by-products</h2>

<p>Category 3 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>, including catering waste and former foodstuffs, can be treated in composting or biogas plants approved for the purpose by the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. Certain very limited types of Category 2 material can also be used in composting and biogas plants. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>manure</li>
  <li>digestive tract content</li>
  <li>milk and milk products</li>
  <li>egg and egg products</li>
  <li>colostrum</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also see the guide on minimising farm waste, composting and recycling.</p>

<h3 id="composting-and-biogas-plants">Composting and biogas plants</h3>

<p>The current EU standards, which are incorporated in UK regulations, allow Category 3 <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> with a maximum particle size of 12 millimetres to be treated in an approved composting or biogas plant at 70°C for one hour.</p>

<p>For plants treating only catering waste, and not other types of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> (except manure, digestive tract content, milk and colostrum), alternative national composting and biogas treatment standards were established following a comprehensive risk assessment. These standards are set out in the <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> Regulations 2005</p>

<p>In addition to these processes, additional barriers or treatment processes must be used to ensure that raw material is properly and securely treated. These barriers are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Raw material must be catering waste that does not include meat.  </li>
  <li>When material is composted, a second stage is required using any of the above standards. For this stage, the windrowing can be done in the open as long as the time, temperature and turning requirements are fulfilled.  </li>
  <li>Material must be stored for at least 18 days - which can be in the open.</li>
</ol>
<p>Biogas plants must include one of the additional barriers:</p>

<p>Composting plants must use either barrier (2) or both barriers (1) and (3).</p>

<h3 id="incinerators">Incinerators</h3>

<p>Regulations apply to most activities that involve burning waste, including burning waste for fuel to ensure that incineration plants achieve high standards of effective emission control to the air, soil, and surface or ground water.</p>

<p>Incineration plants that only burn animal carcasses or parts of carcasses require approval under the <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> regulations, but are exempt from some requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive. Plants which burn other types of <abbr title="Animal by-product">ABP</abbr> - such as former foodstuffs, catering waste and manure, processed products (eg, meat- and bone-meal and tallow) - must be authorised under the Waste Incineration Directive.</p>

<h2 id="animal-by-products-as-feedstuffs">Animal by-products as feedstuffs</h2>

<p>A very limited number of <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> can be used as feedstuffs for farm animals, subject to certain conditions.</p>

<h3 id="milk-and-milk-products">Milk and milk products</h3>

<p>You can use unprocessed milk and milk products as feed for farmed animals if specific conditions are met. Products include raw or pasteurised milk or milk products, whey from non-heat treated milk, or cleaning water used in contact with pasteurised or raw milk. They also include dairy former foodstuffs such as cheese, yoghurt, butter, cream, yoghurt and ice cream.</p>

<p>Processing plants supplying products with a minimum content of 80 per cent milk or milk-product - and the farms that use them for feed - must be registered with the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>. This is to enable a rapid control response and traceability in the event of a disease outbreak.</p>

<p>If you process milk and supply these products for animal feed, or to farms feeding them to farmed animals, you must provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>trading or organisation name</li>
  <li>full address</li>
  <li>contact name</li>
  <li>telephone number</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>whether the business is a processor or a farm</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must give a list of farms and/or intermediaries that are supplied, and the type of product supplied</li>
  <li>farms must give details of the supplier(s) and the type of product that is received</li>

<h3 id="other-abps">Other <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>It is an offence to feed meat, fish, catering waste - whether processed or not - and most other products of animal origin to ruminants, pigs or poultry.</p>

<p>Milk and milk-based products and biscuits, bakery waste, pasta, chocolate, sweets and similar products that contain <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> such as rennet or melted fat, milk or eggs, can be fed to livestock providing the <abbr title="Animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> are not the main ingredient.</p>

<p>Adequate measures must be in place to ensure against cross contamination by meat and other products of animal origin.</p>
