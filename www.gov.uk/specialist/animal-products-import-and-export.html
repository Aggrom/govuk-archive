<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Goods derived from animals are referred to as products of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>). <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> include certain live animals for direct human consumption, foodstuffs, by-products and goods that may have come into contact with animals, such as hay and straw. Most <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> controls apply to countries outside the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>). Intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> transactions are simpler, unless there is a major outbreak of disease. Live animals for breeding and production are also subject to similar controls on imports.</p>

<p>Traders must follow detailed guidelines for specific types of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> as well as the general system of declarations and checks at the point of entry into the UK. You usually need to provide evidence of specific veterinary or health checks to ensure your products are allowed into the UK or to export goods. This guide shows you how the system works, what to do if you have problems and the paperwork you need to import or export <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="products-of-animal-origin-in-international-trade">Products of animal origin in international trade</h2>

<p><abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> are defined as any products derived from animals or products that have a close relationship with animals. They include:</p>

<ul>
<li>fresh meat and offal</li>
  <li>game and poultry</li>
  <li>meat products</li>
  <li>fish, shellfish and fish products</li>
  <li>processed animal protein for human consumption</li>
  <li>processed pet food or raw material for pet food production</li>
  <li>lard and rendered fats</li>
  <li>animal casings</li>
  <li>milk and milk products</li>
  <li>eggs and egg products</li>
  <li>honey</li>
  <li>semen, embryos, manure, blood and blood products</li>
  <li>bones, bone products and gelatine</li>
  <li>hides and skins</li>
  <li>bristles, wool, hair and leathers</li>
  <li>hay and straw</li>
  <li>hunting trophies, ie animal heads and skins</li>
  <li>insect pupae</li>
</ul>
<p>If you intend to trade animal products, you should carefully check the entry requirements before moving the goods. </p>

<p>If you are moving <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you will need to meet any relevant health certification and product-marking requirements specific to each type of product and which are standardised across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. </p>

<p>Generally, each type of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> has specific import requirements in addition to the general procedures laid out in this guide. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">find specific requirements for importing each type of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>When you import <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> from non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries, your goods will be checked at the point of entry into the UK at Border Inspection Posts. You will have to ensure the relevant paperwork has been completed in order for Customs to clear the goods. Goods must be certified by recognised authorities in the originating countries - these countries are approved on an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide basis. You can find out more in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/overseas-veterinary-certificates-and-border-inspection-posts">overseas veterinary certificates and Border Inspection Posts</a>.</p>

<p>When the goods arrive at the port, paperwork is checked by the port health authority (<abbr title="port health authority">PHA</abbr>). Once your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> have passed the checks, and you have paid the right fees, they will be issued with a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> and can be released into customs control and then into free circulation.</p>

<p>If the goods are rejected, you must ensure they’re either re-exported or destroyed.</p>

<p>If you are exporting outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must check the entry requirements for your target country before you ship your goods.</p>

<h2 id="importing-poao">Importing <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>
</h2>

<p>To import <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> from third countries, you must check your supplier is approved and pre-notify the Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>) at the port where the goods are expected to arrive.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports/enforce_authorities/leafletfortrade">Find a leaflet on the key steps and checks to take when importing food on the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.porthealth.eu/Import-Process-POAO.htm">Read a basic guide to importing <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the Port Health website</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/international/trade/im_cond_meat_en.pdf">Download a guide to European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) import conditions for fresh meat and meat products from the Europa website (PDF, 289K)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pre-shipping-checks">Pre-shipping checks</h3>

<p>All <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> entering the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must come from countries that have been approved and meet <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide product specific standards. These are certified by ‘competent authorities’ - usually government departments or agencies - in the originating country. Within the approved country, suppliers of some <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>, such as meat, also need to be approved for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade. However, suppliers of other products, such as eggs, do not need approval.</p>

<p>You should ensure that the consignment can meet all the public and animal health rules for import. Rules do change frequently, for example during an outbreak of a serious animal disease, like foot and mouth disease or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), products may be restricted or banned at short notice, such as the HPAI outbreak in Southeast Asia. The country should have an approved residue plan and should not be subject to any restrictions for animal diseases or other health risks.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/establishments/third_country/index_en.htm">Find approved establishments outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>As an importer, you have a number of legal responsibilities. These include the safety and traceability of your goods, prevention of disease and the withdrawal of products where necessary. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports/importers/pointofentry">see an overview of your legal responsibilities as an importer of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You should also ensure that your health certificates are ready for presentation with the correct support documentation, at the right point in time to the authorities. </p>

<p>New rules apply to the import of animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>) and import of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> for research, medical or museum purposes from third countries. Rules now include imports of <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> for research and diagnostic samples, trade samples (eg for machine testing) and display items (eg for artistic activities). </p>

<h3 id="get-your-goods-to-the-point-of-import">Get your goods to the point of import</h3>

<p>You must import your third country <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> through appropriate <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> where the environmental health officers and vets working in the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> will check them. You must ensure the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> you choose will accept your goods as not all <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> accept every type of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must pre-notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of an incoming consignment in advance. If you do not pre-notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr> of incoming consignments, your goods may be rejected and you will have to re-export them or destroy them at your own expense.</p>

<p>You can make the notification in two ways. You can complete Part 1 of a Common Veterinary Entrance Document (<abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>) which you can obtain from the <abbr title="port health authority">PHA</abbr> managing the appropriate <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>. Alternatively, you can use the online Trade Control and Expert System (<abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>) service to complete Part 1 of the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>. You can find out about using <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> in the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/using-traces-to-trade-in-animals-and-animal-products">using <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> to trade in animal and animal products</a>.</p>

<p>You can do this yourself or use an agent, such as a freight forwarder. </p>

<h3 id="contractual-considerations">Contractual considerations</h3>

<p>Once your goods arrive at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>, they will be subject to checks before they can be released. </p>

<p>It’s essential that you take into account the possibility of goods being rejected at the border when drawing up contracts with your suppliers. <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> are often perishable, so if they’re rejected at the border the goods may have to be destroyed. It’s a good idea to clarify in writing who in your supply chain is responsible for ensuring the paperwork is completed on time, as well as to work closely with your suppliers to minimise the risks of rejection, and ensure you don’t have to pay for rejected goods.</p>

<p>Import requirements change frequently - you may find more of your products need a licence than previously. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">Read latest news on imports of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>When <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> arrive into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> the <abbr title="port health authority">PHA</abbr> at the point of entry into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> makes three checks at the Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
<li>document check - this ensures that any required health certification and pre-notification documents are present and correctly completed</li>
  <li>identity check - this ensures the goods are the same as those described on the accompanying paperwork</li>
  <li>physical check - the <abbr title="port health authority">PHA</abbr> may examine a proportion of the shipment to ensure it does not pose a threat to animal or human health</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical checks are carried out according to the perceived risk level of specific products and their origin. The percentage of consignment checking is set by law.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/overseas-veterinary-certificates-and-border-inspection-posts">overseas veterinary certificates and <abbr title="Border Inspection Posts">BIPs</abbr>.</a></p>

<h3 id="import-licensing-and-paperwork-for-specific-goods">Import licensing and paperwork for specific goods</h3>

<p>You must check the paperwork you will require to import your specific types of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>. If you are importing <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> into the UK that are not covered by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide regulations, you will need to hold a licence to do so. </p>

<h3 id="leaving-the-port">Leaving the port</h3>

<p>Once the document and identity checks are completed, the goods are examined by veterinary inspectors. When these checks are passed and you have made the payment for the inspection, the <abbr title="port health authority">PHA</abbr> will complete Part 2 of the Common Veterinary Entry Document (<abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>) and the goods will be released to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> officers.</p>

<p>Once they are customs approved, the goods can be released and removed from the port. A copy of the <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> must accompany the goods to their first destination after clearing customs, and be retained there for at least 12 months.</p>

<h3 id="keep-up-to-date">Keep up to date</h3>

<p>Regulations, inspection requirements and licensing changes for <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> can change quickly. It’s a good idea to ensure you keep on top of these changes.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">Read the latest news on imports of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="what-happens-if-my-product-of-animal-origin-goods-arent-cleared">What happens if my product of animal origin goods aren’t cleared?</h2>

<p>If your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> aren’t cleared at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>, you will be given a control notice that explains the reasons why.</p>

<h3 id="your-options-when-entry-is-denied">Your options when entry is denied</h3>

<p>There are usually two options open for goods refused entry - re-export or destruction.</p>

<p>As long as the products are not a risk to animal or human health and safety, they can be re-exported outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This must be done within 60 days of the initial rejection, and all certification and documentation for the goods will be amended to show the goods have been rejected.</p>

<p>If you choose to destroy the goods, you must ensure they are destroyed at the approved rendering plant/incinerator nearest to the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/dealing-with-animal-by-products">dealing with animal by-products.</a></p>

<p>Bear in mind, however, that if the destruction of consignments leads to the creation of by-products that can safely be used and marketed, you may do so. You must work closely with the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> vets at the <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> in these cases.</p>

<p>Animal Health approve premises that process animal by products (ABP). <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/managing-disease/animalbyproducts/collection-feeding-abp/Premises-authorized-collect-treat-category-2-3-ABP-for-feeding-to-animals.htm">Find a list of ABP premises on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>In all cases of rejection you’re liable for the costs, such as storage and inspection of the goods before re-export and any costs related to transport and destruction.</p>

<p>You can appeal against any decision to reject your consignments, but you should consider whether it’s worthwhile before you do. </p>

<h2 id="appeals-for-rejected-poao">Appeals for rejected <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Occasionally your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> may not be cleared at the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>.
If you wish to contest a refusal for entry of your goods, your first step is to check the back of the control notice, as this will show you the reasons for the refusal. This will also tell you the organisation to which you should direct an appeal.</p>

<h3 id="appeal-considerations">Appeal considerations</h3>

<p>You will need to carefully consider whether it’s worth appealing - note that an appeal can take considerable time and its value is often questionable for perishable goods. It may be better to examine whether the goods can be re-exported or processed into saleable by-products.</p>

<p>You should consider at which stage of the process problems have arisen. Were your goods rejected by, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>an Animal Health veterinary inspection and Veterinary Laboratories Agency</li>
  <li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs</li>
  <li>a local authority department, such as environmental health</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, rejection can be avoided in the future once you have isolated the reasons for it.</p>

<p>If you wish to make an appeal against any enforcement action or notices served on you, it’s a good idea to take legal advice. The details of who to appeal to, and the time limits within which you must lodge an appeal, will be clearly stated on any control notices or formal documents.</p>

<p>You can find out about <a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/imports/importers/redress/">dealing with appeals and enforcement activity complaints on the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h2 id="exporting-poao">Exporting <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you wish to export <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> successfully, it’s essential to plan everything well in advance. The rules and regulations governing the sector are detailed, variable and complex. Careful research before you start will minimise the risk of time-consuming and costly mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="health-certification-requirements">Health certification requirements</h3>

<p>It is very likely that you will require an official veterinary export health certificate of some kind to export your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>. Your first step should be to check with Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (<abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr>) Specialist Service Centre for Exports to see if a suitable Export Health Certificate (<abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr>) is already available. <a rel="external" href="http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html">Find contact details for the Central Operations Unit for Exports on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>EHCs are typically tailored to meet the key animal health requirements of import permits or other information issued by the importing authorities. Since import permits and other import regulations for a given commodity can even vary from importer to importer, you should ensure that the available <abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr> satisfies the terms of the permit your particular importer has been given. You and your overseas customer may also be required to comply with specific regulations and conditions well in advance of your goods being shipped, so the earlier you know about these the better. For example, your company may have to be specifically approved by the importing authorities and your customer may need to obtain permission to place your goods on the market as well as being in possession of a valid import permit. </p>

<p>It’s always a good idea to check the most up-to-date information on the official requirements of the importing country. This is because importing regulations and requirements can change at short notice in response to a number of factors, in particular threats to animal and human health and safety. Changes to import rules can mean that the <abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr> may no longer be acceptable to the importing authorities which could lead to your goods being detained or denied entry.</p>

<p>If you are having difficulties obtaining the latest requirements from the importing authorities, you may be able to check these through your importer or with the importing country’s foreign embassy in the UK.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/embassies-and-posts/find-an-embassy-overseas/">Find a list of embassies in the UK on the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>) website.</a></p>

<h3 id="check-your-own-capabilities">Check your own capabilities</h3>

<p>Once you know which certification and health requirements you need to meet, you should consider how best to address them.</p>

<p>You can discuss the certification process with your vet or the Official Veterinarian who will sign your <abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr>. You do not have to pay for an <abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr>, but you will have to pay the Official Veterinarian who signs it for the service, as well as for any advice. You can find out about using Official Veterinarians from <abbr title="Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency">AHVLA</abbr> Specialist Service Centre for Exports.</p>

<p>You will also need to confirm any movement, transport and welfare requirements for live animals. Different species have different requirements. </p>

<h3 id="moving-your-goods">Moving your goods</h3>

<p>Once you’re sure you have understood and met all the requirements, ask the Official Veterinarian to inspect and certify your goods for export.</p>

<p>The completed and signed <abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr> will provide the authorities in the importing country with assurances that, based on the information you have provided, your goods met their key animal health requirements at the time of inspection. You should be aware that your goods may be subject to further controls upon arrival, such as physical inspection, laboratory testing or a period of quarantine. You may also have to provide additional documentation to comply with requirements which are not covered by the <abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="intra-eu-movements-of-poao">Intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> movements of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>
</h2>

<p>In most cases, acquiring or dispatching <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is straightforward, although you should take care to keep up to date with changes.</p>

<p>Goods are generally classified as being in free circulation if they have been imported through a Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>) anywhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For example, if a consignment has passed the import checks at a port in Germany, it is usually free to travel from there to the UK. However, you will need to ensure that the relevant documentation travels with each consignment to enable it to pass through ports.</p>

<p>The paperwork you need varies according to which type of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> you are moving. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">Find specific requirements for importing each type of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You must ensure that your goods meet any relevant UK regulations once they have entered the UK, such as labelling requirements. Special requirements apply to some <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>, such as eggs and butter. Health marks are applied to red meat carcasses and wholesale cuts to show that they are fit for human consumption. See the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/food-labelling-and-packaging-in-international-trade">food labelling and packaging in international trade</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/guidancenotes/labelregsguidance/">Find guidance on labelling by type of food on the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>You must also make sure your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> are transported safely. You must also package your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> correctly, as special rules apply.</p>

<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p>You must keep up to date with any changes to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations on the movement of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>, as these will affect any movement between member states. These can change quickly, particularly in the case of outbreaks of disease. You can find up-to-date information on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website. <a rel="external" href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/import-export">See the latest news and key information regarding <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> on the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="specific-licensing-requirements-for-poao">Specific licensing requirements for <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>
</h2>

<p>For some types of goods, you will need to follow different or additional procedures, which are specific to the type of product of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr>) you are importing.</p>

<h3 id="domestic-licensing">Domestic licensing</h3>

<p>If you are acquiring <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> in the UK that are not covered by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide legislation, you will need a domestically issued licence. Many <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> not covered by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide regulations can be imported using general licences (<abbr title="general licences">GL</abbr>) or general authorisations (<abbr title="general authorisations ">GA</abbr>) issued by the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. <abbr title="general licences">GL</abbr>/GAs are freely published documents. However, it’s essential that you check your products are covered by <abbr title="general licences">GL</abbr>/GAs and that you fully understand the terms and conditions of any <abbr title="general licences">GL</abbr>/GAs you use.</p>

<p>If your goods are not covered by either <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation or a <abbr title="general licences">GL</abbr>/<abbr title="general authorisations ">GA</abbr> issued by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, you will need to apply to <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> for a specific licence. Applications for licences are assessed using a risk-based approach based on factors such as the type of product, the health status of the animal from which the product is derived, the health status of the country of origin and the purpose for which the material is being imported. You should do this in advance of shipping the goods in order to avoid them being rejected.</p>

<p>New rules apply to the import of animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>) and import of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> for research, medical or museum purposes from third countries. However, the rules give businesses time to adjust by allowing the use of existing import rules/documentation until 31 January 2012, provided that the accompanying documentation has been signed before 30 November 2011.</p>

<p>Rules now include imports of <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> for research and diagnostic samples, trade samples (eg for machine testing) and display items (eg for artistic activities).</p>

<p>Licenses are also available for the importation of <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> for research, education, diagnostic or museum purposes. </p>

<h3 id="common-agricultural-policy-licences">Common Agricultural Policy licences</h3>

<p>If your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> are covered by the Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>), you will also need to ensure that you are complying with the relevant <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> conditions, including <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> licences, as well as import and export refunds and levies.</p>

<p><abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> licences are issued by the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) and enforced by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Regulations change frequently. To check if your goods need a licence call the Rural Payments Agency Helpline on Tel 0118 968 7333. </p>

<h3 id="convention-on-international-trade-in-endangered-species">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</h3>

<p>If your <abbr title="Products of Animal Origin">POAO</abbr> are covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (<abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr>), you may also need to ensure that you are complying with the <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> rules and you may need to have a <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> licence before you dispatch the goods. Offences relating to species covered by <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> have high penalties.</p>

<p><abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> licences are issued by Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency and enforced by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. To check if your goods need a licence call the <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species">CITES</abbr> Licensing Team on Tel 0117 372 8774 or email them at <a href="mailto:wildlife.licensing@animalhealth.gsi.gov.uk">wildlife.licensing@animalhealth.gsi.gov.uk</a> </p>
