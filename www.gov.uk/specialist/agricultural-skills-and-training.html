<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Learning and training opportunities are important to the farming sector.</p>

<p>Whether you are considering a career in farming - or another land-based industry - or are an established farmer and want to further develop your skills, finding the right education and training in this highly skilled profession is essential.</p>

<p>Qualifications and national standards in the sector are being continuously reviewed and developed to ensure that they meet the needs of the industry.</p>

<p>This guide will help those starting a career understand the range of education and training available to gain the necessary skills and knowledge. It also provides valuable signposts to sourcing further information and support.</p>

<p>It outlines the opportunities available to farmers to update and improve existing skills, and the importance of continuing professional development. This includes business, marketing and management knowledge, and keeping up-to-date with technological advances in an ever-changing industry.</p>

<p>The guide also examines government funding initiatives to sustain and rejuvenate the farming industry.</p>

<h2 id="benefiting-from-agricultural-skills-and-training">Benefiting from agricultural skills and training</h2>

<p>In addition to the courses offered by the range of specialised private training providers and Fresh Start, there are also graduate opportunities.</p>

<p>Landex is a collection of 34 member colleges in England that offer various land-based and farming courses. Courses offered range from full-time, part-time and flexible learning to pre-entry and postgraduate programmes. The course subjects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>agriculture</li>
  <li>countryside management</li>
  <li>environmental conservation</li>
  <li>horticulture</li>
  <li>food processing</li>
</ul>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.landex.org.uk/membership.php">Find a list of Landex member colleges on the Landex website.</a></p>

<p>If you are planning to study at any of these colleges, entry to an Higher National Diploma (<abbr title="Higher National Diploma">HND</abbr>) course usually requires four GCSEs with A to C grades plus one A-level, or an equivalent qualification. Degree courses normally require five GCSEs plus two A-levels or equivalent qualifications. The new Diploma in Environmental and Land-based Studies also gives you the opportunity to go on to study further and higher education.</p>

<h3 id="private-training-providers">Private training providers</h3>

<p>There are a large number of private training providers operating across England. To find out details of training providers registered to offer <abbr title="National Proficiency Test Council">NPTC</abbr>/City and Guilds, Lantra Awards and ABC Awards courses, contact the awarding bodies direct:</p>

<h2 id="new-entrants-into-farming-and-the-land-based-sector">New entrants into farming and the land-based sector</h2>

<p>New entrants into the farming and land-based sector help ensure the future of the industry. Careers range from hands-on practical work through to demanding management opportunities with the chance to manage your own business or work abroad. As new technology advances, the opportunities continue to grow.</p>

<h3 id="fresh-start">Fresh Start</h3>

<p>Fresh Start training academies encourage young rural entrepreneurs to consider a career in farming or other rural-related businesses. There are 24 academies across England offering 12-month courses covering different areas of farm business management. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.careerinfarming.co.uk/">find out about the Fresh Start Academy on the Career in Farming website.</a></p>

<h3 id="afutureincom">Afuturein.com</h3>

<p>This website contains careers information for anyone wanting to start and develop a career in the sector. Developed by Lantra, Sector Skills Council, the site provides careers information for all 17 environmental and land-based industries. <a rel="external" href="http://www.lantra.co.uk/Careers/Career-Finder.aspx">Find information about careers in environmental and land-based industries on the Lantra website.</a></p>

<h3 id="diploma-in-environmental-and-land-based-studies">Diploma in Environmental and Land-based Studies</h3>

<p>The Diploma in Environmental and Land-based Studies has been structured to allow young people in England to study it alongside GCSEs and A Levels. It is available at Foundation, Higher and Advanced Levels in selected schools and colleges from September 2009, with national availability by 2013.</p>

<p>The courses aim to equip young people with the knowledge and understanding relevant to a career in the environmental and land-based sector, and a choice of routes afterwards include farming and land-based apprenticeships, further or higher education opportunities in farming, or directly into work.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.edexcel.com/quals/diploma/environmental/Pages/default.aspx">Find out about the Diploma in Environmental and Land-based Studies and how employers can support its delivery on the Edexcel website.</a></p>

<h2 id="vocational-training">Vocational training</h2>

<p>There are a number of vocational training programmes designed specifically for workers in the agricultural sector. As an employer, you have the flexibility to train your employees in areas specific to your needs and your employees enjoy continuous employment, learn at their own pace and gain new skills. Vocational - including ‘on-the-job’ - training can work in several ways.</p>

<p>Some vocational training falls within the new Qualifications and Credit Framework (<abbr title="Qualifications and Credit Framework">QCF</abbr>). The introduction of the <abbr title="Qualifications and Credit Framework">QCF</abbr> means that training can be delivered as units - bite-sized chunks of learning - and combined with others to build into full vocational qualifications.</p>

<p>The day release system allows people to study while they are in employment. They usually work full time, but for one day a week for a specified period, their employer allows them to attend a college or training course so they can study for a qualification - such as the Diploma in Work-based Agriculture (formerly known as a National Vocational Qualification (<abbr title="National Vocational Qualification">NVQ</abbr>)). Through this new system, you can follow a unit-based, flexible approach to developing your skills, which can build to full qualifications without having to give up work.</p>

<p>Alternative vocational qualifications include the <abbr title="Higher National Diploma">HND</abbr> and the Higher National Certificate (<abbr title="Higher National Certificate">HNC</abbr>) where students attend college or a training course for half a day, then go to work with an employer in their chosen field.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.nptc.org.uk/">Read information on <abbr title="Qualifications and Credit Framework">QCF</abbr> vocational qualifications in land-based and related industries on the <abbr title="National Proficiency Test Council">NPTC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Block release also involves combining work and study. The student attends a course for a specified number of days over a specified time period. For example, someone who is studying livestock management may attend their course for 44 days over a 12-month period.</p>

<h2 id="farming-and-land-based-apprenticeships">Farming and land-based apprenticeships</h2>

<p>Apprenticeships combine on-the-job training with study at an approved college or training provider.</p>

<p>Employers often find that offering apprenticeships is the best way of ensuring that the workers they employ have exactly the right set of skills for the job.</p>

<p>Apprenticeships are a valuable tool in motivating and retaining your workforce, as they are available to new and existing employees.</p>

<p>There are 15 apprenticeships offered:</p>

<ul>
<li>agricultural crops, livestock and mixed farming</li>
  <li>amenity horticulture</li>
  <li>animal care</li>
  <li>aquaculture</li>
  <li>dry stone walling</li>
  <li>environmental conservation</li>
  <li>equine</li>
  <li>farriery</li>
  <li>fencing</li>
  <li>floristry</li>
  <li>game and wildlife management</li>
  <li>land-based service engineering</li>
  <li>production horticulture</li>
  <li>trees and timber</li>
  <li>veterinary nursing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="higher-education-opportunities-in-farming">Higher education opportunities in farming</h2>

<p>In addition to the courses offered by private training providers and through programmes such as Fresh Start, there are also a whole range of higher education opportunities.</p>

<p>Landex is a network of specialist colleges that offer various land-based and farming courses. Courses offered range from full-time, part-time and flexible learning to pre-entry, foundation degrees and postgraduate programmes. The course subjects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>agriculture</li>
  <li>countryside management</li>
  <li>environmental conservation</li>
  <li>horticulture</li>
  <li>food processing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recognising-and-recording-skills">Recognising and recording skills</h2>

<p>There is a vast amount of training in the farming and land-based sectors which goes unrecognised.</p>

<p>Skills and learning are critical to the success of farming businesses. Farmers need to understand the importance of skills they and their staff already possess and encourage greater participation in learning and development and Continuing Professional Development (<abbr title="Continuing Professional Development">CPD</abbr>). Some industries already have <abbr title="Continuing Professional Development">CPD</abbr> schemes which recognise learning. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pig Industry Professional Register (<abbr title="Pig Industry Professional Register">PIPR</abbr>) - where those working in the pig sector can register their staff and participate in relevant, demand-led development courses. <a rel="external" href="http://www.bpex.org.uk/PracticalAdvice/Training/Pipr.aspx">Find out about the <abbr title="Pig Industry Professional Register">PIPR</abbr> and how to become a member on the BPEX website.</a>
