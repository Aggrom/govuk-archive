<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Transhipment licences are one of several different types of licences issued by the Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>). They allow controlled goods to pass through the UK en route to another overseas destination.</p>

<p>Most controlled military and dual-use goods do not need a transhipment licence. However, sometimes, you will need a transhipment licence where either the goods or the destination country - or both - represent a sufficient degree of risk.</p>

<p>There are two categories of transhipment licence - Open General Transhipment Licences (<abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>) and Standard Individual Transhipment Licences (<abbr title="Standard Individual Transhipment Licence">SITL</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you are involved in arranging the transit and transhipment of goods through the UK, this guide will help you to understand the different types of transhipment licences, when you will need one and how you should use it.</p>

<h2 id="transhipment-licences">Transhipment Licences</h2>

<p>Most military and dual-use goods can pass through the UK en route to another pre-determined overseas destination without the need for a UK licence provided the exporter has complied with certain conditions. However, you will need a transhipment licence for certain sensitive goods and destinations.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/transit-and-transhipment">transit and transhipment</a>.</p>

<h3 id="open-general-transhipment-licences">Open General Transhipment Licences</h3>

<p><abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licences">OGTLs</abbr> are similar to Open General Export Licences (<abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr>). You can read more about <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> in our guide: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/open-general-trade-control-licences">an introduction to Open General Export Licences</a>. <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licences">OGTLs</abbr> are available in the public domain, subject to specific terms and conditions.</p>

<p>There are four different types of <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="open-general-transhipment-licence">Open General Transhipment Licence</h3>

<p>This licence allows - subject to conditions - dual-use goods to be imported into the UK and subsequently exported to any part of the <abbr title="Hong Kong Special Administrative Region">HKSAR</abbr>. </p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/ogels-current/12-879-ogtl-hong-kong.pdf">download the current Open General Transhipment Licence (Dual-Use Goods: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (PDF, 28K).</a></p>

<h3 id="standard-individual-transhipment-licences">Standard Individual Transhipment Licences</h3>

<p>If your goods or destination are not covered by the <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>, you might be able to apply for a <abbr title="Standard Individual Transhipment Licence">SITL</abbr> using SPIRE, the Export Control Organisation’s online licensing database.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Standard Individual Transhipment Licence">SITL</abbr> is specific to a named transit/transhipment provider, and covers a set quantity of specific goods between a specific source and destination country with a specified consignor, consignee and end-user. <abbr title="Standard Individual Transhipment Licences">SITLs</abbr> are normally valid for two years. Upon expiry - either by time or because the activity has taken place - the licence ceases to be valid. Should further similar activity take place, a new licence must be applied for.</p>

<p>You should be aware that there are no concessionary licences in the form of Open Individual Transhipment Licences. Therefore, if you fail to meet the conditions of an <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>, a <abbr title="Standard Individual Transhipment Licence">SITL</abbr> will be the only available licence for you.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084613486&amp;r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1084228483&amp;r.l3=1084228524&amp;r.l4=1084314481&amp;type=PIP">apply for an export licence on SPIRE with <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr>.</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-open-general-transhipment-licences">How to use Open General Transhipment Licences</h2>

<p>You must follow all the specified terms and conditions when you use an Open General Transhipment Licence (<abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>), and keep accurate records.</p>

<p>You do not need to physically present your licence document to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) for every shipment exported using <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licences">OGTLs</abbr>. However, you must state the exact licence name - or the SPIRE reference - in full on any supporting documentation you give to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>As the exporter, you are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>meeting all the licence’s defined terms and conditions when you use it</li>
  <li>keeping up to date with any licence amendments - eg changes to permitted or excluded destinations or goods</li>
</ul>
<p>Details of such amendments are published in the Export Control Organisation’s (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s) Notices to Exporters. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/export-control-organisation/eco-notices-exporters">find the latest Notices to Exporters on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>There is a time limit of one month from the date of import for exporting goods under an <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>. Find out more in the section in this guide on further information on transhipment licences.</p>

<h3 id="archived---or-revoked---open-general-licences">Archived - or ‘revoked’ - Open General Licences</h3>

<p>Sometimes <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr> export licences are amended, usually because:</p>

<ul>
<li>new embargoes have been imposed</li>
  <li>sanctions have been lifted</li>
  <li>the goods or countries covered under these licences have changed</li>
</ul>
<p>This archive contains the previous or ‘revoked’ version of these documents. These revoked licences are no longer in legal force, but you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/revoked-ogel-licence-log.xls">download the revoked <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> archive from the <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr> website (XLS, 204K).</a></p>

<h3 id="applying-for-an-ogtl">Applying for an <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Unlike other Open General Licences, it is not necessary to register on the SPIRE export licensing database before using an <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>. However, you do need to apply for a Standard Individual Transhipment Licence via SPIRE. This can be done regardless of location from anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084613486&amp;r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1084228483&amp;r.l3=1084228524&amp;r.l4=1084314481&amp;type=PIP">apply for an export licence on SPIRE with <abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills">BIS</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>You should also bear in mind that you cannot use the <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> Checker website to determine use of Transhipment Licences.</p>

<h2 id="further-information-on-transhipment-licences">Further information on transhipment licences</h2>

<p>The distinction between transit and transhipment is irrelevant from an export licensing point of view, although is a distinction in respect of customs activities. In the case of export licences, ‘transhipment’ refers to:</p>

<ul>
<li>transhipment within the same port or airport - including goods that remain on board or on a through Bill Of Lading or Air Waybill</li>
  <li>removal under transit procedures for export at another port or airport</li>
  <li>goods brought into the UK under an international transit procedure</li>
  <li>goods being transhipped via a Free Zone</li>
</ul>
<p>Goods which are being transited or transhipped via the UK are subject to the same three-tier category of goods as the Trade Controls. For more information, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/transit-and-transhipment">transit and transhipment</a>. This guide also provides more background on excluded destinations, weapons of mass destruction provisions and other considerations.</p>

<h3 id="time-limits-for-exporting-goods-under-an-open-general-transhipment-licence-ogtl">Time limits for exporting goods under an Open General Transhipment Licence (<abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Goods must be exported under an <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr> within one month of the date of import. If this permitted period is exceeded, the goods movement is no longer classed as a transhipment. The exporter will then have to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>apply for a specific export licence (Standard Individual Export Licence or SIEL)</li>
  <li>have an Open General Export Licence (<abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr>) or Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL) in place for the destination</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="items-not-covered-by-an-ogtl">Items not covered by an <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>There are some specific exports not covered by an <abbr title="Open General Transhipment Licence">OGTL</abbr>. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>exports connected with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missiles</li>

<h3 id="compliance-and-enforcement-of-transhipment-licences">Compliance and enforcement of transhipment licences</h3>

<p>The Export Control Organisation (<abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>) is responsible for export control legislation, for the processing of licence applications, and compliance and awareness activity.</p>

<p>Enforcement and prosecutions are carried out by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in conjunction with Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office.</p>

<p>The main legislation enabling <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to enforce controls on goods subject to export prohibitions and restrictions is contained under the Customs and Excise Management Act, which provides that if goods are exported, shipped as stores or brought to any place in the UK for the purpose of being exported or shipped as stores and the exportation is, or would be, contrary to any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force, the goods shall be liable to forfeiture.</p>

<p>An offence will have been committed if the goods have been presented for export or transhipment and either there is no valid licence for the goods or there is a valid licence and one of the conditions of the licence has not been complied with.</p>

<p>For more information about the compliance activities of the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>, see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/compliance-checks-and-enforcement-of-export-controls-on-strategic-goods-and-technology">compliance and enforcement of export controls</a>.</p>
