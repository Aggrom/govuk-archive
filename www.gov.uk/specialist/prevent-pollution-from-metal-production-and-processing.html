<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Metal production and processing businesses can cause significant pollution. Metal production and processing includes manufacturing ferrous, non-ferrous and precious metals and alloys; metal forming processes; bar, wire and tube drawing; and metal casting.</p>

<p>Your activities may cause air pollution from fumes and dust, noise pollution from materials handling and deliveries to your site, water pollution from contaminated discharges or run-off, or land contamination from accidental oil or chemical spills. If you cause a pollution incident, you could be fined and have to pay clean-up costs, and your business’s reputation could suffer.</p>

<p>This guide describes your responsibilities for preventing pollution to air, land and water. It includes guidance on noise and vibration, using furnaces, vehicle emissions, vehicle cleaning and car parks. It also covers how to deal with pollution incidents.</p>

<h2 id="air-pollution-responsibilities-for-metal-producers">Air pollution responsibilities for metal producers</h2>

<p>Metal production and processing businesses emit dust, fumes and gases which can affect air quality. Dust is a major issue at metal production businesses, in particular from moving materials around the site and vehicle movements on unmade roads.</p>

<h3 id="comply-with-your-environmental-permit">Comply with your environmental permit</h3>

<p>If you have an environmental permit, you must comply with the conditions it contains. Conditions may relate to odour and emissions of:</p>

<ul>
<li>halogens - eg chlorine, fluorine, bromine</li>
  <li>oxides of nitrogen</li>
  <li>total particulate matter (dust)</li>
  <li>sulphur dioxide</li>
  <li>ammonia</li>
  <li>volatile organic compounds (<abbr title="volatile organic compounds">VOCs</abbr>) - eg formaldehyde, phenols</li>
</ul>
<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1086287989">environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply.</a></p>

<h3 id="control-odour-and-nuisance">Control odour and nuisance</h3>

<p>You must make sure your business doesn’t cause a nuisance to your neighbours or the local community. Nuisances could include smoke, dust, noise, vibration and odours. Emissions from your business that may cause odour include:</p>

<ul>
<li><abbr title="volatile organic compounds">VOCs</abbr></li>
  <li>substances from mould production, casting and cooling</li>
  <li>emissions from removing casts from moulds</li>
  <li>dust and fumes from materials handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone affected by a nuisance can take legal action against you or your business, or complain to your local authority.</p>

<p>If your business causes a nuisance, or could cause or repeat a nuisance, you can be issued with an abatement notice, which can:</p>

<ul>
<li>stop or restrict your operations</li>
  <li>require you to take steps to restrict or remove the nuisance</li>
</ul>
<p>You can be fined if you do not comply with an abatement notice.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1086041496">noise, odour and other nuisances.</a></p>

<h3 id="avoid-emitting-dark-smoke">Avoid emitting dark smoke</h3>

<p>You must not cause or allow a chimney or bonfire on your site to emit dark smoke. You can apply for an exemption from this requirement, but only if your installation will not cause emissions that could damage health or cause a nuisance. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1080460523">preventing air pollution.</a></p>

<h3 id="avoid-using-ozone-depleting-substances-ods-and-fluorinated-greenhouse-gases-f-gases">Avoid using ozone-depleting substances (<abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr>) and fluorinated greenhouse gases (<abbr title="fluorinated greenhouse gases">F-gases</abbr>)</h3>

<p>In most circumstances, you must not use <abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr> for any degreasing or solvent application. <abbr title="ozone-depleting substances">ODS</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)</li>
  <li>chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li>
  <li>1,1,1-trichloroethane</li>
  <li>bromochloromethane</li>
  <li>carbon tetrachloride</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="fluorinated greenhouse gases">F-gases</abbr> contribute to climate change. Common uses include:</p>

<ul>
<li>solvents</li>
  <li>firefighting and fire protection equipment</li>
  <li>refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>Sulphur hexafluoride is used as a cover gas in magnesium casting. You may be able to replace it with tetrafluoroethane - also known as R-134a, Genetron 134a, Suva 134a or HFC-134a.</p>

<p>If your business uses or handles <abbr title="fluorinated greenhouse gases">F-gases</abbr>, or equipment that contains them, you must comply with your legal obligations. See the guide on how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1084058363">manage fluorinated gases and ozone-depleting substances.</a></p>

<h3 id="store-materials-correctly">Store materials correctly</h3>

<p>Store materials such as salts, fluxes, sand, lime and carbon in sealed silos or buildings. This will help you control dust, minimise emissions to air and reduce waste. Store oils and chemicals in suitable, sealed containers to avoid causing air pollution from fumes. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/waste-and-hazardous-substance-responsibilities-for-metal-producers--3">waste and hazardous substance responsibilities for metal producers.</a></p>

<h3 id="reduce-dust">Reduce dust</h3>

<p>Ensure that roads and open storage areas are hard-surfaced. Clean these regularly to reduce dust.</p>

<p>Use windbreaks to prevent windblown dust causing a nuisance, for example you could plant hedges or install fences.</p>

<p>Minimise vehicle movement and handling of materials and scrap to reduce dust. Reduce the number of material transfer points you have. Cover raw materials securely during transportation.</p>

<p>Use dust suppression techniques. For example, use water sprayers or wheel washers to prevent lorries throwing up dust from roads.</p>

<h3 id="control-fumes">Control fumes</h3>

<p>If you cast metal, you can reduce fumes by preheating ladles and allowing a sufficient cooling period before you knock out the castings.</p>

<p>Cover oil-quenching tanks to prevent fumes escaping, and reduce fire risk.</p>

<p>Pass the exhausts from cold-rolling mills through mist eliminators before you discharge them to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Filter exhaust gases before discharging them from welding and milling stations.</p>

<p>Use local fume extraction equipment to reduce the impact of emissions from hot welding processes.</p>

<p>Inspect and maintain all abatement equipment regularly, eg scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators and bag filters. Inspect, at least every month, your emissions to air and your equipment for measuring emissions. Keep your inspection records on site in case you need them.</p>

<p>When you buy new plant or equipment make sure it has emission reduction features, eg complete combustion, canopies to capture emissions, or systems to reuse emitted gases to pre-heat scrap metal.</p>

<h2 id="noise-pollution-responsibilities-for-metal-producers">Noise pollution responsibilities for metal producers</h2>

<p>Metal production and processing businesses may create noise and vibration from:</p>

<ul>
<li>vehicles on site, especially if they have reversing alarms</li>
  <li>deliveries of raw materials, fuel and oil</li>
  <li>moving scrap metal and other materials on site</li>
  <li>operation of large machinery and plant</li>
  <li>playing loud music</li>
</ul>
<p>If noise or vibration from your activities causes a nuisance to the surrounding community, your local authority can limit your operations or even stop you from working. They can restrict:</p>

<ul>
<li>the machinery you use</li>
  <li>your working hours</li>
  <li>noise levels from your premises</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a permit or exemption and you breach noise conditions, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you. If you do not address a noise problem you could face legal action and a fine.</p>

<p>You must comply with any noise conditions set out in the planning approval for your site.</p>

<h3 id="register-your-burglar-alarms">Register your burglar alarms</h3>

<p>If your business is located in a designated alarm notification area you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>register your burglar alarm with your local authority</li>
  <li>provide the details of a person who holds the keys</li>
  <li>ensure the key holder knows how to use the alarm system</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be fined if you do not register. Contact your local authority to find out if your business is in an alarm notification area.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://online.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1074537118">Find contact details for your local authority through the Contacts Directory.</a></p>

<h3 id="protect-your-employees-from-loud-noise">Protect your employees from loud noise</h3>

<p>Loud noise can cause irreversible hearing damage. You must protect your employees’ hearing.</p>

<p>If you have an environmental permit or a waste exemption, it may contain conditions that control emissions, such as noise. You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-metal-production">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice">Good practice</h3>

<p>Refer to the British Standards to help you monitor and control noise and vibration levels on your site. You may find the following British Standards useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>British Standard BS4142 - Method for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential and industrial areas</li>
  <li>British Standard BS6472 - Guide to evaluation of human exposure to vibration in buildings</li>
  <li>British Standard BS7385 - Evaluation and measurement for vibration in buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are available from British Standards Online. Buy copies of the full standards or view summaries on the <a rel="external" href="http://shop.bsigroup.com">British Standards Online website.</a></p>

<p>Carry out noisy activities away from areas where noise may cause a nuisance. Position noisy equipment away from your site boundary. You can use existing buildings to shield the noise source.</p>

<p>Make sure your buildings have adequate soundproofing. Shutting your doors and windows will also reduce noise. Use solid panelled fencing around your site instead of wire fences. This can help to screen the source and reduce the level of noise from your site.</p>

<p>Reduce noise from your equipment and vehicles by servicing them regularly. Consider fitting noise-reducing devices, and when you replace equipment consider buying quieter alternatives.</p>

<p>You should regularly monitor noise from your site, when it is fully working and also when it is shut down. This will give you an idea of the impact of your work on noise levels in the surrounding community. Monitoring will also help you identify any change in noise levels. If you are in any doubt about noise levels, you should get advice from a noise expert.</p>

<p>Limit noisy activities to daylight hours as noise is more likely to be a nuisance at night.</p>

<h3 id="installing-a-furnace">Installing a furnace</h3>

<p>Your local authority must approve your plans before you use any new furnace, or make changes to an existing furnace. You must not emit dark smoke, and all new furnace installations must be able to run continuously without emitting smoke.</p>

<p>Furnaces must be fitted with grit and dust arrestment plant. You can apply for an exemption from this requirement, but only if your installation will not cause emissions that could damage health or cause a nuisance.</p>

<p>Your local authority regulates chimney height if your furnace fuel consumption exceeds 45.4 kilograms of solid fuel or 366.4 kilowatts of liquid or gas fuel per hour. Your chimney must be high enough to prevent smoke, grit, dust, gas and fume emissions from damaging health or causing a nuisance.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1080460523">preventing air pollution.</a></p>

<h3 id="radioactive-sources">Radioactive sources</h3>

<p>If your furnace uses a radioactive source, for example in level-detection or smoke detection devices, you must have an environmental permit from the Environment Agency. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1086709576">managing radioactive substances.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice-1">Good practice</h3>

<p>To minimise dust and fumes from your furnaces, you could:</p>

<ul>
<li>use hooding and bag filters to capture fumes and dust from furnaces - this is particularly important where you charge the furnace, and where you remove molten metal, dross and slag</li>
  <li>minimise transfers of molten metal to reduce emissions</li>
  <li>cover transfer points wherever possible to keep air away from molten metal</li>
  <li>maintain strict temperature control when alloying - this prevents metal fuming</li>
  <li>use automated burner controls to reduce polluting emissions</li>
  <li>remove as much lubricating emulsion as possible before annealing to reduce polluting emissions to air</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider replacing oil-fired burners with gas or electric alternatives when a furnace reaches the end of its life. This will help you to reduce emissions. You could also design a new plant to reduce and control emissions.</p>

<p>You can save your business money by ensuring your furnaces work efficiently. See the guide on how to <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1087402946">reduce energy use and carbon emissions from metal production.</a></p>

<h2 id="water-and-sewer-discharge-responsibilities-for-metal-producers">Water and sewer discharge responsibilities for metal producers</h2>

<p>If you pollute water, or cause or risk causing environmental damage to water, you may be committing an offence. Metals production and processing businesses may use large quantities of water for cooling equipment. You may produce wastewater from:</p>

  <li>sludges from scrubbers</li>
  <li>site drainage and stormwater run-off</li>
  <li>washing and cleaning processes</li>
</ul>
<p>Wastewater may contain heavy metals such as zinc, cadmium and lead. It may also contain oils and greases from scrap metals or lubricants. Rainwater run-off may also be contaminated by materials you store or handle on your site.</p>

<h3 id="get-permission-to-discharge-to-water-and-sewers">Get permission to discharge to water and sewers</h3>

<p>You must get an environmental permit or register an exemption from environmental permitting with the Environment Agency before you discharge anything other than clean, uncontaminated water to surface waters or groundwater. You may also need consent if you need to construct a new outfall structure for your discharge.</p>

<p>You must comply with the conditions of your permit or exemption or you may be prosecuted and fined.</p>

<p>You must have permission from your water and sewerage company before you discharge anything other than clean, uncontaminated water to their drainage system. If you discharge trade effluent to a public foul sewer, you must first have a trade effluent consent or agreement.</p>

<h2 id="land-contamination-responsibilities-at-metal-production-sites">Land contamination responsibilities at metal production sites</h2>

<p>Many areas of land in the UK are contaminated by their past use. For example, land could be contaminated where chemicals have seeped into the land from previous industrial activities, or where previous owners have buried waste.</p>

<p>If you operate a metal production and processing site, your activities could cause land contamination from:</p>

<ul>
<li>oil or grease seeping from scrap metal into the ground</li>
  <li>spills of fuel, oil or chemicals</li>
  <li>pollutants seeping from leaking pipes or poorly maintained drainage systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Cleaning up land affected by contamination is called remediation. Remediation ensures that the land no longer presents a risk to human health or the environment.</p>

<h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-land-contamination">Responsibilities for cleaning up land contamination</h3>

<p>You could be responsible for cleaning up land contamination, for example, if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>develop land that is contaminated</li>
  <li>cause environmental damage to land</li>
  <li>cause contamination in breach of your environmental permit</li>
</ul>
<p>You could be required to clean up land contamination before you are permitted to carry out development.</p>

<p>If you cause serious land contamination that affects the water environment, protected species or habitats, or human health, this can be classed as environmental damage. You could be responsible for land contamination if it is classed as environmental damage. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1080367423">dealing with land contamination.</a></p>

<p>You could also be responsible for land contamination if it is caused by you breaching the terms of your environmental permit. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1086287989">environmental permits - who needs one and how to comply.</a></p>

<h3 id="responsibilities-for-cleaning-up-contaminated-land-under-part-2a">Responsibilities for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A</h3>

<p>Contaminated land is a legal term used to describe a specific type of land contamination that is regulated under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Part 2A deals with the UK’s legacy of contaminated land from past uses, such as former factories, mines, steelworks, refineries and landfills.</p>

<p>Your local authority is responsible for identifying contaminated land and making sure it is cleaned up. Land is classed as contaminated land under Part 2A when substances in, on or under it cause, or could cause, significant harm or pollution of surface waters and groundwater.</p>

<p>You could be responsible for cleaning up contaminated land under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>cause or allow any land to be contaminated</li>
  <li>own or occupy the land, even if you did not cause the contamination</li>
</ul>
<p>Your local authority or the Environment Agency can serve you with a remediation notice. It will tell you what you must do to clean up the land and when you must carry out the work. A remediation notice can be served on more than one business. You can be prosecuted and may be fined if you do not comply with a remediation notice.</p>

<p>You can remediate contaminated land voluntarily and agree a remediation scheme with your local authority or the Environment Agency.</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-cleaning-responsibilities-for-metal-producers">Vehicle cleaning responsibilities for metal producers</h2>

<p>You are responsible for avoiding pollution from vehicle cleaning or wheel washing by anyone at your site.</p>

<p>If you take your vehicles to a commercial facility such as a car wash, this guidance does not apply to you.</p>

<h3 id="control-run-off-from-vehicle-cleaning">Control run-off from vehicle cleaning</h3>

<p>Surface run-off from washing areas can contain high levels of pollutants such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>detergents</li>
  <li>oil and fuel</li>
  <li>suspended solids</li>
  <li>grease</li>
  <li>antifreeze</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not allow run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater. This will cause pollution and you could be prosecuted.</p>

<p>You should only wash vehicles in defined areas where you can contain the wash water and any rainfall run-off.</p>

<p>If possible, direct the surface run-off from your vehicle washing area to an on-site treatment system. You could reduce your impact on the environment and save money by reusing the water.</p>

<p>You may be able to discharge surface run-off directly to a foul sewer or combined sewer. Ask your water and sewerage company if you need authorisation before you discharge run-off to a sewer. You must comply with any conditions of your authorisation.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-metal-production">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, collect your run-off in a sealed unit and send it to an authorised disposal site. Check that anyone who takes your waste away from your site is a registered waste carrier. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1079431917">duty of care - your waste responsibilities.</a></p>

<h3 id="good-practice-5">Good practice</h3>

<p>Use vehicle washing facilities and equipment that filter and reuse water, or set up a wash water recycling system.</p>

<p>Use trigger-operated spray guns. Make sure they have an automatic water supply cut-off.</p>

<p>Use settlement lagoons or suitable absorbent material such as flocculent to remove suspended solids, eg mud and silt. Before using flocculent, contact your water and sewerage company to make sure that you can still discharge to the sewer.</p>

<p>Use catchpots or silt traps on drains, and ensure that they are in place during cleaning. Empty them at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Remove oil, grease and fuel from wash water by passing it slowly through an appropriately-sized oil separator.</p>

<p>Ensure that any discharge containing detergent cannot run to the oil separator, as this will stop it working.</p>

<p>If you use detergents, use a recycling system with no discharge or ensure that run-off containing detergents is collected in a sealed unit. Contact your local water and sewerage company about disposing of these materials to the foul sewer.</p>

<p>Download Pollution prevention guideline: Use and design of oil separators in surface water drainage systems (PPG3) from the <a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0406BIYL-e-e.pdf">Environment Agency website (PDF, 79K).</a></p>

<p>Minimise the amount of cleaning chemicals you use. Choose biodegradable and phosphate-free detergents as they are less harmful to the environment.</p>

<p>Carry out cleaning in a designated impermeable area that is isolated from the surrounding area, eg by a roll-over bund, raised kerb, ramps or stepped access.</p>

<p>Store all cleaning chemicals safely and in an area where you can contain spills. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1086114143">chemical storage.</a></p>

<p>If your business causes a nuisance to your neighbours, your local authority can require you to take steps to reduce or stop the nuisance, or impose restrictions on or stop your operations.</p>

<p>Nuisances could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>noise and fumes from vehicle engines</li>
  <li>noise from vehicle alarms, eg reversing alarms</li>
  <li>dust from vehicles on unmade road and car park surfaces</li>
  <li>excessive artificial lighting</li>
  <li>waste deposits</li>
  <li>vermin attracted by waste</li>
  <li>accumulated wind-blown rubbish</li>
</ul>
<p>You should control these potential sources of nuisance. See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1086041496">noise, odour and other nuisances.</a></p>

<h3 id="check-your-permit-and-exemption-conditions">Check your permit and exemption conditions</h3>

<p>If you have an environmental permit or registered exemption, it may contain conditions that control emissions such as noise, dust or odour.</p>

<p>You must comply with all of the conditions in your permit or exemption. If you don’t comply, the Environment Agency or your local authority can take enforcement action against you, such as issuing you with an enforcement notice or a suspension notice for breach of a condition.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/environmental-permits-licences-and-exemptions-for-metal-production">environmental permits, licences and exemptions for metal production</a>.</p>

<h3 id="control-surface-water-run-off">Control surface water run-off</h3>

<p>Water that runs off the surface of your car parks can cause erosion, pollution and localised flooding. Run-off may contain pollutants such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>oil and fuel</li>
  <li>hydraulic fluids</li>
  <li>suspended solids</li>
  <li>grease</li>
  <li>antifreeze</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not allow contaminated run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater without permission. This will cause pollution and you could be prosecuted. </p>

<p>If you have a car park that has an area less than 800 square metres (fewer than 50 parking spaces), and you only use it for parking cars, you can discharge surface water run-off directly as long as you are not next to sensitive environments, eg Sites of Special Scientific Interest.</p>

<p>If you have a larger car park, you should remove oil, grease, petrol and diesel from run-off by passing it through an oil separator before you discharge it. You should also use an oil separator for any run-off from areas used for more polluting activities, such as vehicle servicing.</p>

<p>Download Pollution prevention guideline: Use and design of oil separators in surface water drainage systems (PPG3) from the <a rel="external" href="http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO0406BIYL-e-e.pdf?lang=_e">Environment Agency website (PDF, 79K).</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you may be able to use sustainable drainage systems to drain run-off from car parks. These slow and hold back run-off from a site, so that pollutants can be broken down naturally.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079068363&amp;r.l2=1087321018&amp;r.l3=1087426768&amp;topicId=1085829333">using sustainable drainage systems to prevent pollution and flooding.</a></p>

<p>If you clean vehicles on your car park, you must not allow run-off to enter surface water drains, surface waters or groundwater. If someone else cleans vehicles on your car park, it is your responsibility to ensure that they do not cause pollution. </p>

<h3 id="good-practice-6">Good practice</h3>

<p>Use an oil separator in your surface water drains to remove oil, grease, petrol and diesel from surface water run-off.</p>

<p>Use catchpots or silt traps on drains, and ensure that they are in place and working effectively during cleaning. Empty them at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Reduce dust on your site by:</p>

<ul>
<li>paving roads, haulage areas and parking areas</li>
  <li>reducing speed limits on unmade surfaces to 10-15 miles per hour, especially for heavy vehicles</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pollution-incident-prevention-at-metal-production-sites">Pollution incident prevention at metal production sites</h2>

<p>Accidents on industrial and commercial sites can cause serious pollution incidents. These may damage the water environment and biodiversity, cause air pollution and land contamination and harm human health.</p>

<p>Pollution incidents can be caused by:</p>

<ul>
<li>fuel drips, spills or overfilling during refuelling or tank filling</li>
  <li>plant, pipes, equipment or containers leaking oil or chemicals</li>
  <li>pump and pipeline failures</li>
  <li>contaminated water entering a watercourse or drain</li>
  <li>natural events, such as flooding, lightning strike and temperature extremes</li>
  <li>vandalism and theft</li>
  <li>deliberate acts, such as illegal disposal, dumping or fly-tipping</li>
  <li>wind blown dust and waste</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="produce-a-pollution-incident-response-plan">Produce a pollution incident response plan</h3>

<p>You should have a pollution incident response plan which outlines the actions you will take to reduce the chances that your business causes pollution from an incident or accident at your site.</p>

<p>Your plan should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>your site activities and operations</li>
  <li>what you store on your site, eg fuel, raw materials, chemicals and waste</li>
  <li>emergency and out-of-hours contact details for key staff, regulators and emergency services</li>
  <li>a detailed site plan showing drainage layout, areas where the chances of causing pollution are high and areas vulnerable to pollution</li>
  <li>the actions to take in the event of an incident</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevent-and-remediate-environmental-damage">Prevent and remediate environmental damage</h3>

<p>A pollution incident may cause, or threaten to cause, environmental damage to water, land and biodiversity.</p>

<p>You must take action to prevent environmental damage and to remedy any damage you cause.</p>

<h3 id="prevent-pollution-from-firefighting">Prevent pollution from firefighting</h3>

<p>Firewater is water that has become contaminated by being used for firefighting. It is polluting and may be classified as hazardous waste. Ensure you have a plan and equipment in place to collect or contain it in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
<li>store firewater correctly</li>
  <li>ensure firewater is treated and disposed of correctly</li>
  <li>prevent firewater from running into surface drains, polluting nearby watercourses (rivers, streams and groundwater), foul drainage systems and land</li>
</ul>
