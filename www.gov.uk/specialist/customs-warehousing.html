<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Customs warehousing can benefit traders who import goods because it offers a storage facility that delays duty and/or import VAT payments until the goods leave the customs warehousing procedure or enter another customs procedure. Customs warehouses are operated by warehouse-keepers, who must be authorised by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Traders can either store their goods in an existing customs warehouse or ask <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for authority to set up their own customs warehouse on their own premises. Goods imported from outside the European Union are eligible for storage in a customs warehouse, and Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) and community goods may also be stored on the premises of a customs warehouse in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>This guide explains in detail the different types of customs warehouse available so you can see which suits you best. You can also find out what types of goods are eligible for storage, the documentation you need to enter, store and, where authorised, undertake a usual form of handling in a customs warehouse, and how to apply to operate your own customs warehouse.</p>

<p>This section on customs duty reliefs contains detailed guidance.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.l2=1087337125&amp;r.l3=1079840705&amp;r.l4=1079819587&amp;topicId=1078259558">Use our interactive tool to understand what customs procedures and reliefs apply to your business</a></p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-customs-warehousing-eligible-goods-and-types-of-customs-warehouse">When to use customs warehousing, eligible goods and types of customs warehouse</h2>

<p>Customs warehouses are premises or systems that are authorised and supervised by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Entering your goods to customs warehousing means you can delay paying customs duty, import VAT, and where appropriate excise duty, until the goods leave the customs warehousing procedure or enter another customs procedure. You can also use customs warehousing when your goods have arrived in the UK and:</p>

<ul>
<li>you want to re-export them</li>
  <li>you’re uncertain about the final destination of your goods upon arrival</li>
  <li>your import licences or paperwork have been delayed or you are waiting for a duty-relief quota to become available in respect of, for example, agricultural goods</li>
  <li>you want to discharge another customs procedure, such as Inward Processing for non-excise goods</li>
  <li>you wish to store your goods together with goods subject to another customs procedure with economic impact (eg Processing under Customs Control, Inward Processing) or with goods that are already in free circulation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eligible-goods">Eligible goods</h3>

<p>To be eligible for customs warehousing, your goods should have been imported from outside the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) and be liable to customs duties and/or import VAT, or be moving in duty suspension from another member state - eg the goods have been entered to a duty suspension procedure in another member state or are moving under Community Transit.</p>

<p>You can also, if suitably authorised, use the customs warehouse procedure to store <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods that are eligible for an export refund or Community goods under the common or co-storage arrangements.</p>

<p>Goods subject to prohibitions or restrictions must be presented with the appropriate supporting documents at the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> frontier. Meat or meat products must also have been subject to frontier veterinary checks prior to their entry to the customs warehousing procedure.</p>

<p>There are usually no time limits for storing goods, except <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-customs-warehouse">Types of customs warehouse</h3>

<p>There are two main types of customs warehouse:</p>

<ul>
<li>A public warehouse (Type A) is operated by a warehouse-keeper for the storage of goods placed under the customs warehousing procedure by other traders known as depositors</li>
  <li>A private warehouse can be used to store goods deposited by an individual trader who is authorised as the warehouse-keeper. The warehouse-keeper need not necessarily own the goods, but they must be the depositor.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of private warehouse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type C premises-based warehouse</li>
  <li>Type D premises-based warehouse - the trader is authorised to release goods for free circulation under the Local Clearance Procedure (<abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr>). Any duty due on removal is based on the classification, value and quantity of goods applicable on entry to the customs warehouse</li>
  <li>Private Type E customs warehouses where a record-keeping system is authorised (instead of premises) and which traders can also be authorised to release goods for free circulation under <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr> if required. However, the authorisation for this is stricter than for Types C and D.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read about the additional conditions for a type E customs warehouse in <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000253&amp;propertyType=document">Notice 232 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>Additional controls exist for warehouses used to store excise goods.</p>

<p>Even though warehouse-keepers may not own their premises, they must keep stock records and maintain and operate the warehouse in a way that meets health and safety requirements.</p>

<p>While type B and F warehouses exist within European Community legislation they are not available in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="operating-a-customs-warehouse-authorisation-and-responsibilities-of-warehouse-keepers-and-depositors">Operating a customs warehouse: authorisation and responsibilities of warehouse-keepers and depositors</h2>

<p>Many traders choose to set up as warehouse-keepers and operate their own private customs warehouse, either premises or systems based. A customs warehouse must be authorised by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> before it can accept goods for storage in duty suspension. To be authorised, your business must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be established in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>use the warehouse primarily to store goods</li>
  <li>prove there is a real economic need for a customs warehouse and that you will have enough clients or business to make the operation viable</li>
  <li>be able to comply with the conditions of authorisation</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also have to provide a financial guarantee. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will need to make additional checks on businesses who want to establish a Type E warehouse. For example, your accounting system must be authorised by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and payment of duties under <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> must be secured by the deferment arrangements.</p>

<p>To apply for UK authorisation or to use the arrangements in a type E warehouse, you must complete <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> form C1410.</p>

<p>Find the application to operate a customs warehouse or to use the arrangements in a type E warehouses in <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/forms/viewform.jsp?formId=157">form C1410 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>You can find the application for authorisation to operate a customs warehouse on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_Forms&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000480"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>Send the completed form to your local Customs authorising office.</p>

<p>If you want to use the customs warehousing procedure and then want to enter goods to another Customs procedure (such as Inward Processing) without a full declaration being required, you should apply for an integrated authorisation on <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> form C1410. Find out about integrated authorisation on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000253&amp;propertyType=document#P203_20799"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>If you will be carrying out storage operations in more than one member state you may apply for a single authorisation by completing the model application form in Commission Regulation 2454/93 (Annex 67). You must use the European Community application form. Mark the form ‘SA-CPEI ONLY’.</p>

<p>You can find out which authorities to submit an application for a single authorisation to on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_MIG_009895#P4_27"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<h3 id="warehouse-keepers-responsibilities">Warehouse-keepers’ responsibilities</h3>

<p>Warehouse-keepers’ responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>complying with conditions contained in their authorisation</li>
  <li>checking the goods on arrival to account for any shortages or surpluses of goods, allocating stock numbers, and keeping them secure and under supervision</li>
  <li>maintaining stock records for at least four years</li>
  <li>allowing <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> officers access to the warehouse, the goods, and their records</li>
  <li>maintain the premises safely and run the warehouse in a way that meets Health and Safety requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Type E warehouse-keepers may require additional checks.</p>

<p>If you choose to use a public customs warehouse you are a depositor and take responsibility for the declaration which places the goods under the customs warehouse procedure. You have particular responsibilities to:</p>

<ul>
<li>correctly declare the goods, including where an agent is used by giving clear written instructions</li>
  <li>ensure that your goods are sent directly to the warehouse shown on the declaration (within five days of your customs declaration)</li>
  <li>provide the warehouse-keeper with details of the declarations and an explanation of any discrepancies that are identified</li>
  <li>ensure the goods are correctly declared on removal from the customs warehouse</li>
</ul>
<p>You are also responsible for customs debt. If you are using a type A warehouse you must give the warehouse-keeper all the details of your customs declaration for their records and make sure that the warehouse-keeper holds a valid customs warehouse authorisation for the type of goods you wish to deposit.</p>

<h3 id="authorise-an-agent-to-make-declarations-on-your-behalf">Authorise an agent to make declarations on your behalf</h3>

<p>There are two types of representation:</p>

<ul>
<li>direct representation - the agent enters goods in your name and on your behalf but you are still responsible for any customs debt that may arise from errors</li>
  <li>indirect representation - the agent enters goods in their own name on your behalf and they are jointly liable with you for any customs debt that may arise from errors</li>
</ul>
<p>Warehouse-keepers and depositors must always give clear written instructions for the goods to be entered, and make sure they check details of their goods on any paperwork. If you are a depositor and have authorised an agent to enter goods to a public Type A warehouse, you are responsible for checking that the agent sends the correct paperwork to the warehouse-keeper.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> officers make a decision that you disagree with, you can appeal within 30 days. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will tell you what you need to do if you disagree and will offer you a review.</p>

<h2 id="enter-goods-into-a-customs-warehouse">Enter goods into a customs warehouse</h2>

<p>Traders can enter goods into a customs warehouse in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>directly from import (including from Community Transit)</li>
  <li>from a Free Zone</li>
  <li>after Inward Processing</li>
  <li>after Processing under Customs control</li>
  <li>after repayment of import duty has been approved on rejected imports</li>
  <li>after temporary admission</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have checked availability at the warehouse of your choice, you or your agent must complete the Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) form C88 and present it to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You can find the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_Forms&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000465"><abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> form (C88) on the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>You should take care to fill the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> correctly as errors made on this form could leave you liable to a Customs debt.</p>

<p>Further information on the boxes which require completion when a declaration is made to customs warehousing can be found in Volume 3, Part 3 of the UK Tariff.</p>

<p>You can find guidance on filling out the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> for customs warehousing procedures on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000253#P293_32666"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>You can also see information on all the boxes that need to be filled in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/declarations-and-the-single-administrative-document">Declarations and the Single Administrative Document</a></p>

<p>Goods must be moved to approved premises within five days of your declaration to customs warehousing being made.</p>

<h2 id="handling-and-storing-goods-in-customs-warehouses">Handling and storing goods in customs warehouses</h2>

<p>Customs warehouses are for the storage of goods, but some minor handlings - known as ‘usual forms of handling’ - are allowed in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ensure goods are preserved</li>
  <li>improve their presentation or marketable quality</li>
  <li>prepare them for distribution or resale</li>
</ul>
<p>Usual forms of handling must be authorised by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> prior to the handling taking place. Generally this will be at the same time as authorisation to operate the customs warehouse is granted. You can remove samples from the customs warehouse with prior authorisation from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Find an application to operate customs warehouses or use arrangements in Type E warehouses on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000480"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>You can also remove goods from the warehouse on a temporary basis to undertake a usual form of handling provided you return them within three months. You must keep records and obtain <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> authorisation in both cases. Find information on handling customs warehousing goods on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000253&amp;propertyType=document#P387_43957"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>You can process goods further if you transfer them to Inward Processing. However, there must be an intention to re-export the goods. Find out more about Inward Processing in the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/inward-processing">Inward Processing</a></p>

<h3 id="co-storage-and-common-storage">Co-storage and common storage</h3>

<p>Co-storage allows you to maximise your available warehouse space by permitting the storage of Community goods and non-Community goods. You can also store IP goods and <abbr title="Processing under Customs Control">PCC</abbr> goods providing the status of your goods can be identified at all times. You must inform <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and keep full records.</p>

<p>If you are unable to identify the customs duty of your goods held under customs warehousing, Inward Processing or <abbr title="Processing under Customs Control">PCC</abbr> at all times you can still store them together in common storage. However, the common storage arrangement only applies to goods that share the same eight-digit commodity code, the same commercial quality and the same technical characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="releasing-customs-warehouse-goods-to-free-circulation-and-paying-duties">Releasing customs warehouse goods to free circulation and paying duties</h2>

<p>Release to free circulation means removal of the goods from the customs warehousing procedure.</p>

<h3 id="paying-duties-on-goods-being-released-from-the-customs-warehousing-procedure">Paying duties on goods being released from the customs warehousing procedure</h3>

<p>When your goods are released from the customs warehousing procedure, you may have duties and taxes to pay. You can work them out using:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Tariff description (from Volume 2 of the Tariff) and rate of duty</li>
  <li>the quantity and/or the value</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> official rate of exchange</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also have to pay import VAT at this time - see the guide on Classification rules and the Tariff. For further information you can find guidance in Notice 702/9 (VAT Imports CPEI procedures, end use and free zones) for import VAT on the <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000199&amp;propertyType=document"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<p>The valuation of goods for the calculation of import duties is based - in a Type D warehouse - upon entry into the warehouse, while for A, C and E Type warehouses, the value of the goods is determined upon removal.</p>

<h2 id="discharge-of-customs-warehousing-to-another-customs-procedure-and-transferring-goods-between-customs-warehouses">Discharge of customs warehousing to another customs procedure and transferring goods between customs warehouses</h2>

<h3 id="discharge-to-another-customs-procedure">Discharge to another customs procedure</h3>

<p>You can discharge your liability to a customs debt for customs warehousing goods if you enter the goods to another customs-approved treatment or use, for example re-export. A declaration must be made on a Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) form C88 using the customs procedure code applicable to the procedure you wish to enter. You can find out more about how the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> works in the guide to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/declarations-and-the-single-administrative-document">declarations and the Single Administrative Document</a></p>

<p>Find out details of the requirements of specific customs procedure codes in the page on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/declarations-and-the-single-administrative-document">Single Administrative Document duty and transit codes</a> in the guide on declarations and the Single Administrative Document.</p>

<h3 id="transfers-to-other-warehouses">Transfers to other warehouses</h3>

<p>When you are authorised to use a customs warehouse, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will tell you which methods you can use to transfer goods. They may also ask to examine your goods. The dispatching warehouse-keeper must make sure that the receiving warehouse-keeper is authorised to receive them, as well as to handle any simplified transfer procedures.</p>

<p>You can transfer your goods to another customs warehouse (only) using:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> form C88 using the copy 3 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> (normal procedure)</li>
  <li>using copy 2 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Community Transit - see the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/transit-and-other-suspensive-regimes">Community Transit</a>
</li>
  <li>commercial documents</li>
  <li>full declaration procedure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entering-goods-to-community-transit">Entering goods to Community Transit</h3>

<p>Community Transit is the European Community’s system for moving non-Community goods within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on which Customs duty and/or other import charges have not yet been paid.</p>

<p>Community Transit can be used to discharge goods from the customs warehousing procedure if authorised. Find out about Community Transit procedures on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/procedural_aspects/transit/common_community/index_en.htm">Europa website.</a></p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/transit-and-other-suspensive-regimes">Community Transit</a></p>

<h3 id="receiving-goods-from-another-customs-warehouse">Receiving goods from another customs warehouse</h3>

<p>To receive goods from another customs warehouse, you must be authorised for Local Clearance Procedure receipts.</p>

<h3 id="sad-transfers">
<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> transfers</h3>

<p>Under the normal procedure, traders can use the copy 3 <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> to transfer goods between customs warehouses</p>

<p>To save time and avoid the need to inform <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in advance, you can also - if authorised - use a simplified transfer procedure using only copies 1 and 4 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Find information about completion of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> for transfers in <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000253&amp;propertyType=document#P488_56481">Notice 232 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a></p>

<h3 id="commercial-documentation">Commercial documentation</h3>

<p>Commercial documents may also, if authorised, be used to transfer goods. Your local Customs supervising office will tell you what information needs to be provided.</p>

<h3 id="full-declaration-procedure">Full declaration procedure</h3>

<p>You may choose to discharge your liability to any customs debt due on the goods at the time they leave your warehouse. To do this you can make a full declaration to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> (completing the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> C88 as required by the UK Tariff). You should ensure that the trader to whom the goods are being dispatched is aware that you are making a declaration to their warehouse and you should advise them of the full particulars of the declaration.</p>

<h2 id="importing-to-customs-warehouses-using-customs-freight-simplified-procedures">Importing to customs warehouses using Customs Freight Simplified Procedures</h2>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> can be used to import goods. Traders who want to use <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> must be authorised to do so. As the system is electronic, benefits include reducing paperwork and approval times. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist/customs-freight-simplified-procedures-cfsp">Customs Freight Simplified Procedures</a></p>

<p>Goods can be admitted to customs warehousing under <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr> or under the Local Clearance Procedure, with the appropriate conditions met for that type of procedure. If you choose to use <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr> to enter your goods, additional procedures apply depending on the type of warehouse.</p>

<p>Applications for <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> can be made alongside applications to operate a customs warehouse.</p>

<p>To be authorised, traders and agents will have to show that they meet a range of enhanced conditions regarding accounts and records, customs compliance and solvency. These enhanced criteria will need to be in place in your business before <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can grant authorisation - customs officers may visit your premises to verify your systems and paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="entering-goods-using-cfsp">Entering goods using <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> can be used to enter goods to and remove goods from a customs warehouse, provided a valid <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr> authorisation is held. Under <abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>, formalities at the frontier are kept to a minimum with the bulk of fiscal and statistical data being supplied electronically to Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight at a later date, however there are some exceptions.</p>

<h2 id="removing-goods-from-customs-warehouses-for-re-export">Removing goods from customs warehouses for re-export</h2>

<p>The National Export System can be used to re-export goods. As the system is electronic, benefits include reducing paperwork and approval times.</p>
