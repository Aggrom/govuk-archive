<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you trade goods within the EU and the value of either your sales or purchases exceeds the thresholds for the calendar year you must provide details on a monthly basis by returning Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>) to the Intrastat system.</p>

<p>Intrastat is a monitoring system giving essential information to the government about trade between EU member states. Any VAT registered business that has Arrivals (goods acquired from suppliers in other EU member states) or Dispatches (goods supplied to customers in other EU member states) with a value above the relevant threshold has to complete and submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>. Thresholds are reviewed annually and may change.</p>

<p>The Intrastat system only covers the movement of goods - services are not included except in very specific circumstances. This guide specifically covers <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for Intrastat. Help and advice for supplying <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for trade with non-EU countries is covered elsewhere on the site.</p>

<p>The information contained in this guide is detailed. For intermediate information, see the guide on Intrastat - reporting the value and volume of intra-EU trade  and for basic information see an introduction to Intrastat.</p>

<h2 id="intrastat-and-the-role-of-sds">Intrastat and the role of <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Intrastat is a system used to keep accurate records of the UK’s trade with other EU member states.</p>

<p>If you’re VAT registered and trading goods with businesses or individuals in other EU member states and either your flow of Arrivals (goods acquired from within the EU) - or your flow of Dispatches (goods dispatched to other EU member states) pass either or both annual thresholds you must submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for Intrastat.</p>

<p>The 2012 thresholds are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>If you are trading goods with countries outside the EU you may need to complete customs declarations. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/introduction-to-intrastat">using and submitting <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Data supplied on <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> is used to build an accurate picture of trade between EU member states. It’s used by the government to inform and improve economic policy. The data required to complete <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> is closely aligned with the information on your VAT returns - you will already be gathering much of the information required to discharge your VAT responsibilities. See the guide <a href="https://www.gov.uk/intrastat-step-by-step-process">Intrastat - step by step process</a>.</p>

<h2 id="your-responsibilities-for-making-supplementary-declarations">Your responsibilities for making Supplementary Declarations</h2>

<p>You must submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> if the value of the goods you either bring in from or sell on to individuals or businesses in the EU exceeds the annual threshold.</p>

<p>The threshold is set for the calendar year. It is reviewed annually and may be subject to change. The 2012 thresholds remain at £600,000 for Arrivals (goods acquired from other EU member states) and £250,000 for Dispatches (goods you send to customers in other EU member states).</p>

<p>You must submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> if the value of either your Arrivals or Dispatches exceeds the applicable threshold in the calendar year. If both your Arrivals and Dispatches exceed the thresholds, you must submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for both.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> are only required to record the movement of goods - the supply of services is excluded. <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> are required when goods over the threshold value are:</p>

<ul>
<li>bought and sold</li>
  <li>transferred between the same legal entity - such as subsidiary companies in different EU member states</li>
  <li>sent or returned after processing - such as components being shipped out and finished products being returned</li>
  <li>installed or used in construction</li>
  <li>on long-term hire or lease exceeding 24 months</li>
  <li>supplied free of charge - excluding commercial samples and promotional material</li>
  <li>supplied as part of a service contract - for example industrial cleaning equipment necessary to fulfil a cleaning contract in another member state</li>
  <li>lost or destroyed - if goods dispatched from the UK are lost or destroyed in transit they should be recorded on the supplementary declarations - this does not apply to arrivals</li>
</ul>
<p>When calculating the value of goods for <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> you must include any related freight or insurance charges where they form part of the invoice or contract price of the goods. You must also include any goods supplied free of charge. However, you must not include the value of any excise duty that may be payable. You must also exclude any freight and insurance costs not included in the contract price. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-complete-your-intrastat-supplementary-declaration">how to complete your Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3 id="submission-deadlines-and-threshold-calculations">Submission deadlines and threshold calculations</h3>

<p>You must submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> on a monthly basis. <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> usually cover a calendar month and you must submit your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> by the 21st of the month - ie the <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for March must be submitted by the 21st of April. If you use special VAT accounting periods, your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> can match but please refer to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Notice 60 for more information.</p>

<p>If your level of trade in goods with other EU member states reaches the threshold you must submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> from the first day of the month in which the threshold is exceeded. You must continue to submit <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> until the annual value of your trade falls below the next year’s threshold - usually announced in November each year. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-complete-your-intrastat-supplementary-declaration">how to complete your Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Submitting accurate and timely <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> is a legal requirement. If you persistently file your data late or provide misleading or partial information, you may be prosecuted and fined.</p>

<h2 id="information-you-need-to-complete-sds-for-intrastat">Information you need to complete <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for Intrastat</h2>

<p>To complete <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> you will need specific information to hand.</p>

<h3 id="business-information">Business information</h3>

<p>You will need your business name and address, VAT registration number and branch identifier if required. If an agent is submitting <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> on your behalf they’ll also need to supply their own matching information. You will also need your sales or purchase ledgers, invoices, and any other commercial documentation relating to the sale or purchase of goods for the month of return.</p>

<h3 id="period-covered">Period covered</h3>

<p>This is the calendar month - or the month most covered by the period if you’re using special VAT accounting periods. The period is the month and year (mmyy) to which the declaration refers - eg 0112 for January 2012. </p>

<h3 id="commodity-code">Commodity code</h3>

<p>You must classify your goods using the Intrastat Classification Nomenclature (<abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr>) codes. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-complete-your-intrastat-supplementary-declaration">how to complete your Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>It’s essential that you use the right classification codes. </p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>

<p>The value of the goods covered by the <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> must be included, rounded up to the nearest pound in the same way as your VAT return. You must not include duty or service charges that may have been included on the invoice. </p>

<h3 id="nature-of-transaction-codes">Nature of Transaction Codes</h3>

<p>Special codes are used to signify what type of transaction you’re reporting. For example, a straightforward sale is signified by Nature of Transaction Code (<abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr>) 10 while credit notes are denoted by using <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> 16. </p>

<h3 id="weight-or-supplementary-units">Weight or supplementary units</h3>

<p>You must record the weight (net mass in kilograms) or a supplementary unit for each data line of goods. The required unit of measurement is defined by the commodity code. Only one measure is required.</p>

<h3 id="to-and-from-codes">To and from codes</h3>

<p>On <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for Arrivals you must use the country code indicating the member state from where the goods have come. On the <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> for Dispatches you must use the code for the member state to which you have sent the goods.</p>

<h3 id="delivery-terms">Delivery terms</h3>

<p>If the value of the goods you acquire or supply exceeds £16 million annually you will also have to record the delivery terms on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>. See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-complete-your-intrastat-supplementary-declaration">how to complete your Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="classifying-your-goods-for-sds">Classifying your goods for <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>When reporting your Arrivals and Dispatches on <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> you must use the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> - a set of commodity codes that specifies the type of goods in which you’re trading.</p>

<p>Commodity codes comprise eight digits, with each pair of digits added from left to right adding more detail to the description. The first two digits signify a broad product category, the second pair of digits are a subdivision of that category, and so on. </p>

<h3 id="getting-the-right-codes">Getting the right codes</h3>

<p>There are a number of methods you can use to find your goods’ commodity codes. You can use the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> Online service from uktradeinfo. You can browse or search the database of codes and keep a list of ‘favourites’ for regularly used codes. The service is free. <a rel="external" href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/TradeTools/ICN/Pages/ICNSearch.aspx">Find out about <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> Online on the uktradeinfo website</a>. </p>

<h3 id="help-and-advice-on-classification">Help and advice on classification</h3>

<p>While the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> system is detailed, there may be circumstances when it’s not easy to achieve a perfect match for your goods to a particular classification. If you’re not sure you can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Tariff Classification Service enquiry line on 01702 366 077. You can get advice on a maximum of three different types of goods in each call. It’s worth having detailed information to hand when you call so the advice can be as accurate as possible.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may find it useful to obtain Binding Tariff Information (<abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr>). This is a document that establishes - for six years - a commodity code within which a specific type of goods fall. It’s binding across the EU and cannot be transferred to another holder. If the classification for your goods is unclear, holding <abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr> can save you time and money. The service is free although you will have to bear the costs of any laboratory work or expert research required to finalise the document. For further information on how to get <abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr> see the information on classification of goods.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-sds">Preparing <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are two types of <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> - ‘Arrivals’ and ‘Dispatches’. If the value of your Arrivals (goods coming into the UK) or your Dispatches (goods leaving the UK) exceeds the Intrastat threshold you need to submit an Arrivals or Dispatches <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>, as appropriate. If both Arrivals and Dispatches exceed the threshold you need to submit both an Arrivals and a Dispatches <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>.</p>

<p>The 2012 thresholds are £600,000 for Arrivals and £250,000 for Dispatches.</p>

<p>You will need to classify your goods according to the <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> in order to complete your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>. </p>

<h3 id="calculating-the-value">Calculating the value</h3>

<p>The calculation of the value of your goods is an essential step in preparing your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>. Using International Commercial Contracts (Incoterms) to describe the basis of the transaction will help define the value you need to declare.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re supplying goods free on board you should only declare the value of the goods and the cost of transport to the port of departure. If you’re supplying goods delivered duty paid, you should include the value of the goods and the costs incurred in delivering the goods to the specified destination.</p>

<p>Find out more about using Incoterms in the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/incoterms-international-commercial-terms">International Commercial Terms - Incoterms</a>.</p>

<p>If the annual value of your flow of Dispatches or Arrivals exceeds £16 million you will also have to report the delivery terms on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for that section of the flow which exceeds £16 million.</p>

<p>It’s essential to remember that you must not include any excise duty in your value calculations.</p>

<h3 id="transaction-codes">Transaction codes</h3>

<p>You will also need to have a Nature of Transaction Code (<abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr>) ready to complete your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>. An <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> defines what type of transaction you’re reporting. NOTCs are also used to reconcile returns following replacements of goods or credit notes being issued. The most common <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Codes">NoTCs</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>10: denoting a sale or purchase</li>
  <li>30: denoting a change of ownership of the goods at no charge</li>
  <li>40: denoting goods sent for processing</li>
  <li>50: denotes goods returned from processing</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> 40 and 50 can only be used when the goods sent for processing from the UK are returned to the UK (not necessarily to the company which originally dispatched the goods).</p>

<h3 id="weight-or-supplementary-unit">Weight or supplementary unit</h3>

<p>You will need to record either the weight (net mass) or a supplementary unit for the consignment. The <abbr title="Intrastat Classification Nomenclature">ICN</abbr> commodity code you use will define which measurement is required for your goods.</p>

<p>See the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-complete-your-intrastat-supplementary-declaration">how to complete your Intrastat <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3 id="destination-or-origin">Destination or origin</h3>

<p>You will also need to indicate which EU member state the goods have come from or are going to in the form of a two-letter code.</p>

<h2 id="submitting-sds-for-intrastat">Submitting <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for Intrastat</h2>

<p>Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>) are submitted electronically.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-sds-online">Submitting <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> online</h3>

<p><abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> are submitted electronically.</p>

<p>You can use the internet to submit your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> using one of two systems. You can either fill in the online form or upload the data from a Comma Separated Value (<abbr title="Comma Separated Value">CSV</abbr>) file you have prepared or use the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>

<p>You can find out about completing the online form, uploading data files for <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> and using EDI to submit your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> in the information on Intrastat - technology and technicalities.</p>

<h2 id="advice-on-complex-transactions-under-the-intrastat-system">Advice on complex transactions under the Intrastat system</h2>

<p>While the reporting requirements for Intrastat are simple there are occasions where the nature of your business may mean your responsibilities are more complex - such as when your VAT accounting periods don’t align with calendar months or goods have been returned.</p>

<h3 id="location-of-goods">Location of goods</h3>

<p>The movement of your goods is the most important element in completing your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> correctly. For example, if you buy goods from a customer in Spain but the goods are dispatched from Germany you should record those Arrivals as coming from Germany rather than Spain. This is known as triangulation.</p>

<h3 id="errors-credit-notes-and-retrospective-discounts">Errors, credit notes and retrospective discounts</h3>

<p>Sometimes you will have to issue credit notes or discounts after your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> for the period has been submitted. When this happens you need to add a balancing entry to your next return covering the credit. To do so using the electronic service you must use the first digit of the <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Code">NoTC</abbr> followed by a ‘6’. This will indicate to the system that it’s a minus value and will balance your records accordingly.</p>

<p>A similar principle is followed if an adjustment needs to be made as a result of a change in trading terms or goods being returned, such as goods shipped and not paid for or the receipt of stage payments. Further information on this can be found in section 7.2 of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Notice 60. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>However, you must not use <abbr title="Nature of Transaction Codes">NoTCs</abbr> to amend errors on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>. If you find an error, you must supply an additional declaration for that period.</p>

<h3 id="customs-processes">Customs processes</h3>

<p>If your goods are entered into customs processes this will have an impact on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> reporting.</p>

<p>If your goods move into customs warehouses or Free Zones do not record them for Intrastat. If the goods are brought into free circulation and then move to another EU member state an Intrastat report will be required. This also applies to goods moved between excise warehouses in different member states. Goods moving between excise warehouses within the UK should not be reported for Intrastat.</p>

<p>For goods going into an excise warehouse in the UK from another member state there are different rules depending on whether the goods are for retail distribution or are to be further processed.</p>

<p>If your goods are covered by Inward Processing (<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>) suspension and are moving under Community Transit procedures you do not include them on your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>. If both you and the company in the other member state are approved by their respective customs authorities to use the simplified procedure for <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> suspension goods the movements should be reported on the <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can find further information about the arrangements for goods in customs processes in sections 17.1 to 17.4 of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Notice 60. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-detailed-information">Other detailed information</h3>

<p>The uktradeinfo website has detailed information for other special situations, such as the position for leasing and hire of goods, progress and stage payments and goods on sale or return. </p>

<p>If your query isn’t covered, other detailed information is available in Notice 60 which provides detail about all your Intrastat obligations.</p>

<h2 id="supplementary-declaration-record-keeping-and-the-intrastat">Supplementary Declaration record keeping and the Intrastat</h2>

<p>You must keep specific paperwork when completing and filing <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="key-documents">Key documents</h3>

<p>You must retain a copy of every <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr> you submit - or an agent submits on your behalf - and all papers and documents used to compile your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> for at least six years.</p>

<p>You can keep these documents in an electronic format, provided it can be read by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="inspections">Inspections</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> carries out inspections from time to time to ensure that businesses are complying with their Intrastat obligations. The visit is almost always to your premises even if you use an agent. When the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> representative visits they’ll need access to all your <abbr title="Supplementary Declaration">SD</abbr>-related paperwork, so it’s advisable to keep your records organised.</p>

<h3 id="day-to-day-management">Day-to-day management</h3>

<p>In most cases, managing your Intrastat responsibilities will be comparatively simple. It’s prudent to check your <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> against your VAT return to see if the figures tally.</p>

<p>Any differences between your VAT returns and <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> may be queried by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, although <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> understands that circumstances - such as credit notes - may create a discrepancy between the <abbr title="Supplementary Declarations">SDs</abbr> and the VAT return.</p>

<p>Check Notice 60, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s guide to Intrastat - for more detailed guidance on inspections and day-to-day management of your Intrastat responsibilities. <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000267&amp;propertyType=document">Read Notice 60 Intrastat general guide on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website</a>.</p>
