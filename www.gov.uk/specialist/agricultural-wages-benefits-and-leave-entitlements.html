<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Agricultural Wages Board is responsible for setting the minimum rates of pay and other terms and conditions for workers employed in agriculture. Each year an Agricultural Wages Order sets out the agricultural minimum wage rate and other terms and conditions that apply to agricultural workers in England and Wales from 1 October of that year to the end of 30 September in the following year.</p>

<p>If you employ agricultural workers, this guide will help you understand how to apply minimum rates of pay, and benefit and leave entitlements for the different grades and categories of agricultural worker.</p>

<p>It will also help your workers to check their rights and entitlements.</p>

<p>This information is for guidance only, and you are advised to seek independent professional advice on specific worker or employer enquiries, or to contact the Pay and Work Rights Helpline on Telephone: 0800 917 2368.</p>

<h2 id="grades-and-categories-of-workers">Grades and categories of workers</h2>

<p>The current Agricultural Wages Order identifies six grades and four categories of agricultural worker.</p>

<p>To decide which grade or category applies, you will need to take into consideration each worker’s contract of employment, the number of hours worked, when they work these hours, their responsibilities, their qualifications and various other factors. Under the provisions of general employment law, you must give all workers statutory written particulars of employment if you have employed them for a month or more under a written or oral contract.</p>

<h3 id="grade-1---initial-grade">Grade 1 - initial grade</h3>

<p>A worker who does not meet the criteria for other grades falls into this grade.</p>

<h3 id="grade-2---standard-worker">Grade 2 - standard worker</h3>

<p>Standard workers must either hold one of the vocational qualifications set out in the Agricultural Wages Order for qualification to Grade 2 and have told you that they hold the minimum entry requirements, or they should meet one of the criteria below:</p>

<ul>
<li>work mainly or wholly without the presence of a supervisor</li>
  <li>work with animals</li>
  <li>be in control of powered machinery</li>
  <li>drive an agricultural tractor</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grade-3---lead-worker">Grade 3 - lead worker</h3>

<p>A worker is a lead worker if the worker has been working in agriculture for at least two years in the last five years - including time spent under instruction or training.</p>

<p>Lead workers must either hold at least one of the lead worker minimum entry requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>an approved vocational qualification - such as a Level 2 National Certificate/Diploma in Agriculture or Horticulture, or a Level 2 BTEC Diploma in Agriculture or Horticulture</li>
  <li>a total of four National Proficiency Tests Council certificates of competence specified for grade 3 in the relevant sector</li>
</ul>
<p>Or they should fulfil all of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>work as part of a team of workers</li>
  <li>be responsible for leading the team in which they work, ensuring compliance with management instructions</li>
  <li>not be authorised to take disciplinary action in relation to any worker</li>
  <li>be designated as a grade 3 team leader, and - if required by the employer - satisfactorily complete a trial period of up to one month in this role</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grade-4---craft-grade">Grade 4 - craft grade</h3>

<p>A craft grade worker must:</p>

<ul>
<li>hold at least one of the Grade 4 minimum entry requirements for the sector they are currently employed in</li>
  <li>have been working in agriculture for at least two out of the last five years</li>
  <li>have worked for 12 months or more for the same employer since first obtaining their Grade 4 entry requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Grade 4 minimum entry requirements include one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>S/NVQ Level 3 NPTC/City and Guilds qualification in agricultural crop and livestock production or mixed farming</li>
  <li>NPTC/City and Guilds Advanced National Certificate in Agriculture</li>
  <li>Edexcel BTEC National Diploma/Certificate in either Agriculture, Horticulture or Forestry and Arboriculture</li>
  <li>Edexcel BTEC Higher National Certificate/Diploma in either Agriculture, Horticulture or Countryside Management</li>
  <li>Advanced Apprenticeship in Agricultural Crops and Livestock or in Production Horticulture</li>
  <li>eight certificates of competence specified for Grade 4 in the relevant agricultural sector in an Appendix to the annual Order</li>
</ul>
<p>For full details of Grade 4 minimum entry requirements, <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264041&amp;id=265748">download the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) Agricultural Wages Order 2011 from the Agricultural Document Library (ADLib) website (PDF, 1.05MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="grade-5---supervisory-grade">Grade 5 - supervisory grade</h3>

<p>This worker is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>supervising work on a farm, or part of it, disciplining staff and implementing management decisions</li>
  <li>instructing, supervising and disciplining staff</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grade-6---farm-management-grade">Grade 6 - farm management grade</h3>

<p>A worker in this grade has:</p>

<ul>
<li>management responsibility for an entire farm or farm business</li>
  <li>responsibility for employing, disciplining and dismissing staff</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="full-time-flexible-worker">Full-time flexible worker</h3>

<p>Workers are in this category if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>have entered into a written Flexible Working Agreement for at least one year to normally follow a pattern of flexible working for 39 basic hours a week, or 39 basic hours a week on average over two or three weeks and the basic hours are spread across 4 to 6 days</li>
  <li>have requested or benefited from trade union representation in any discussions leading up to their signing a Flexible Working Agreement</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-time-flexible-worker">Part-time flexible worker</h3>

<p>Workers are in this category if their Flexible Working Agreement contracts them to work for less than 39 basic hours per week.</p>

<p>For complete details on all the above categories, you can <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264041&amp;id=265748">download <abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s Agricultural Wages Order 2011 from the ADLib website (PDF, 1.05MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="apprentice">Apprentice</h3>

<p>This category of worker is employed under arrangements known in England as Apprenticeships or Advanced Apprenticeships.</p>

<h3 id="trainee">Trainee</h3>

<p>A trainee is someone who is on work experience as part of an agricultural training scheme approved by the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills; or, as part of the Diploma in Environmental &amp; Land-Based Studies for 14-16 year olds; or in the second phase of the European Leonardo de Vinci Programme and works in agriculture for their employer as part of that scheme. </p>

<h2 id="minimum-rates-of-pay-an-overview">Minimum rates of pay: an overview</h2>

<p>Agricultural workers are entitled to receive at least minimum rates of pay - which depend on their grade or category - and allowances. </p>

<p>They also have a special sick pay allowance. </p>

<h3 id="agricultural-worker-entitlements">Agricultural worker entitlements</h3>

<p>Workers that fall within Grades 1-6, flexible workers and apprentices are all entitled to receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>standard rate </li>
  <li>overtime pay</li>
  <li>pay for other leave</li>
  <li>night work pay</li>
  <li>standby duty allowance</li>
  <li>bad weather pay - see the section below on other pay and allowances</li>
  <li>dog allowance</li>
  <li>birth and adoption grants </li>
  <li>holiday pay </li>
</ul>
<p>Work-experience trainees are not entitled to be paid for the hours covered by their training contract. However, if their work experience provider contracts them to carry out additional work on top of their training contract and they do this work, they must be paid at overtime rates.</p>

<h3 id="overtime-pay---workers-other-than-flexible-workers">Overtime pay - workers other than flexible workers</h3>

<p>Overtime for Grades 1-6, apprentices and trainees includes working:</p>

<ul>
<li>more than eight hours in any day</li>
  <li>any hours beyond normal working hours specified in their employment contract</li>
  <li>on a public holiday</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the worker’s contract of employment started before 1 October 2006, overtime also includes any work done on a Sunday, or a Monday before the time they normally start work, after they have started working on the previous Sunday and continued working into the Monday.</p>

<h3 id="overtime-pay---flexible-workers">Overtime pay - flexible workers</h3>

<p>For flexible workers, overtime includes working more than 39 hours in any week (for full-time flexible workers), or any hours beyond normal working hours specified in their employment contract (for part-time flexible workers).</p>

<p>To see the full definition of overtime, <a rel="external" href="http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=264041&amp;id=265748">download the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (<abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s) Agricultural Wages Order 2011 from the Agricultural Document Library (ADLib) website (PDF, 1.05MB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-pay-and-allowances">Other pay and allowances</h3>

<p>Even if bad weather prevents you providing work, you must pay workers for the hours they are contractually required to work.</p>

<p>Workers’ piece work wages must not be less than the appropriate hourly minimum for the actual hours worked.</p>

<p>On-call allowance must be paid if you agree with a worker that they will be able to get into work within a given time, or you require them to wait near their home until you decide if they are needed.</p>

<p>Employers must pay the night work rate for work done between 19.00 one evening and 06.00 the following morning.</p>

<h3 id="national-minimum-wage-nmw">National minimum wage (<abbr title="National minimum wage">NMW</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Where <abbr title="National minimum wage">NMW</abbr> becomes higher than the agreed agricultural minimum rate of pay, you must pay minimum pay rates equal to <abbr title="National minimum wage">NMW</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-rates-of-pay-categories-of-worker">Minimum rates of pay: categories of worker</h2>

<p>Minimum rates for agricultural workers in Grades 1-6 are specified for basic pay and also for different circumstances such as overtime work, and for various allowances.</p>

  <li>full-time flexible workers who work 39 basic hours per week or as an average per week</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="night-work-rates">Night work rates</h3>

<p>You must add at least £1.33 per hour to basic pay rates for the applicable grade of worker for each hour of night work that the worker does.</p>

<h3 id="on-callallowance">On-call allowance</h3>

<p>The amount of the on-call allowance - where the worker is not actually called out to work - is a sum equal to two hours overtime pay at the rate applicable to that worker’s grade or category. If you do require an on-call worker to attend work, you must pay the worker whichever is the greater of:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay at the minimum overtime rate for the worker’s grade or category for the hours worked in consequence of being on-call</li>
  <li>a sum equivalent to two hours’ overtime pay at the minimum rate applicable to the worker’s grade or category</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dog-allowance">Dog allowance</h3>

<p>If you require a worker to keep one or more dogs, you must add £7.42 per week (per dog) to the minimum pay rate.</p>

<h2 id="training-and-trainees">Training and trainees</h2>

<p>If an agricultural worker attends an approved training course, or receives approved training at their normal place of work, you must pay workers at least their normal wage for the time they spend in training, and for any time travelling to and from training.</p>

<p>You must also pay any fees for the course and any necessary expenses, such as travel, board and lodging.</p>

<p>Once an initial grade worker has worked continuously for you for a total of 30 weeks, and wishes to undertake training to gain the minimum entry requirements for a Grade 2 standard worker, you must meet the cost of training and pay the worker their normal wage and necessary expenses during the training.</p>

<h3 id="trainees">Trainees</h3>

<p>Work-experience trainees are not entitled to holidays, payment for the hours covered by their training contract, or other paid leave. But if they are contracted to carry out extra work on top of their training contract, you must pay overtime rates.</p>

<p>If you hire a trainee on completion of their training contract, the time spent under the training contract counts towards the 52-week eligibility threshold required under the Agricultural Wages Sick Pay (<abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr>) arrangements.</p>

<h3 id="apprentices">Apprentices</h3>

<p>You must pay minimum pay rates for an apprentice in their first and second years. Minimum rates for a Grade 2 standard worker apply in the third year. Other terms are the same as for a Grade 2 standard worker.</p>

<p>Hours worked include time when an apprentice is at college to receive training required as part of their apprenticeship arrangements or travelling to their training venue when they would otherwise be working.</p>

<p>Weekly rates apply to an apprentice who works 39 basic hours a week. Hourly rates apply to an apprentice who works less than 39 basic hours a week.</p>

<p>Apprentices are eligible for:</p>

<ul>
<li>overtime rates </li>
  <li>minimum holiday pay</li>
  <li>birth and adoption grants </li>
  <li>dog allowance </li>
</ul>
<p>An apprentice who otherwise meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to <abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr> when they have been continuously employed by you for at least 52 weeks.</p>

<h2 id="payments-in-kind">Payments in kind</h2>

<p>Provision of a house or other accommodation is the only benefit that can count as payment in kind of part of the worker’s minimum wage.</p>

<p>A house is defined as a whole house or self-contained accommodation fit for human habitation - but not a caravan or mobile home - that a worker is required to live in by their contract of employment. It includes any garden that goes with the house.</p>

<p>‘Other accommodation’ is defined as any living accommodation other than a house, and meets the minimum standards set out in the Agricultural Wages Order, including that it:</p>

<ul>
<li>is fit for human habitation</li>
  <li>is safe and secure</li>
  <li>provides a bed for the sole use of each worker</li>
  <li>provides wholesome drinking water</li>
  <li>provides suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences and washing facilities</li>
  <li>meets standards set out in Workplace Health, Safety and Welfare Regulations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maximum-deductions-from-minimum-wage">Maximum deductions from minimum wage</h3>

<p>An employer may deduct £1.50 from the worker’s minimum wage for each week in which a house is provided to that worker, unless an Agricultural Wages Committee revalues the weekly benefit attributable to the provision of a house.</p>

<p>In this case, you may deduct from the worker’s minimum wage the lower of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the weekly amount specified by the Agricultural Wages Committee</li>
  <li>the amount resulting from multiplying the number of days for which the house is provided by £4.73</li>
</ul>
<p>You may deduct £4.73 from the worker’s minimum wages for each day the other accommodation is provided, as long as that worker has worked at least 15 hours that week (subject to the consideration of holidays in the calculation of these 15 hours).</p>

<h2 id="rest-breaks">Rest breaks</h2>

<p>Except for some categories of worker - who can determine their own working hours - all workers who are aged 18 or over who work more than five and a half hours a day are entitled to a rest break.</p>

<p>Working time is defined as any period where the worker is working, at their employer’s disposal and carrying out their duties, or receiving relevant training.</p>

<p>Unless you and the worker agree to compensatory rest, the rest break should be an uninterrupted period of at least 30 minutes, which can be spent away from the immediate place of work. It must be taken during working time on the day on which the worker works enough hours to qualify for a rest break, and must not be at the beginning or end of a period of working time.</p>

<h3 id="compensatory-rest">Compensatory rest</h3>

<p>Compensatory rest can be provided in place of a rest break if one of these conditions apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>the worker’s activities are such that their place of work and of residence are distant from one another, or their different places of work are distant from one another</li>
  <li>you and your worker agree to alter the rest breaks requirements, as permitted by the Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended)</li>
  <li>any of the following takes place on the relevant day: 
    <ul>
<li>the worker’s activities involve the need for continuity of service</li>
      <li>there is a foreseeable rush of activity</li>
      <li>the worker’s activities are affected by exceptional events that were unavoidable despite you exercising due care</li>
      <li>there is an accident or imminent risk of an accident</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If circumstances require a worker to work during what would have been a rest break, you must make sure that you safeguard the worker’s health and safety and also allow them to take an equivalent period of compensatory rest. This does not need to be on the day when the rest break was missed.</p>

<h2 id="holidays-and-other-leave">Holidays and other leave</h2>

<p>All workers, except work-experience trainees, are entitled to paid annual leave and other types of paid leave such as public holidays and bereavement leave.</p>

<p>You must give employees their holiday pay for any annual leave on the worker’s last working day before the start of that period of annual leave.</p>

<h3 id="amount-of-annual-leave">Amount of annual leave</h3>

<p>The annual leave year for all agricultural workers starts on 1 October in one year and ends on 30 September in the next year.</p>

<p>The amount of paid annual leave that workers can take depends on the number of days they work each week.</p>

<h3 id="annual-leave-entitlement-for-a-worker-who-works-a-varying-number-of-days-each-week">Annual leave entitlement for a worker who works a varying number of days each week</h3>

<p>To calculate this, you need to follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Establish the number of weeks from the start of the annual leave year to the day immediately before the start of the worker’s holiday (‘the period’).</li>
  <li>Calculate the number of qualifying days in the period - days when the worker was working basic hours or guaranteed overtime - and any days when the worker was taking: 
    <ul>
<li>annual leave</li>
      <li>other leave under this order</li>
      <li>statutory ordinary adoption leave</li>
      <li>statutory ordinary maternity leave</li>
      <li>statutory paternity leave</li>
      <li>sick leave (whether paid or not)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>Divide the number of qualifying days (from step 2) by the number of weeks in the period (from step 1). This gives the number of days worked each week.</li>
  <li>The table above shows the worker’s annual leave entitlement for the number of days worked each week.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="annual-leave-entitlement-for-a-worker-who-is-not-employed-for-the-whole-leave-year">Annual leave entitlement for a worker who is not employed for the whole leave year</h3>

<p>To calculate this, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Depending on the number of days worked each week, use the table above to establish what the worker’s annual leave entitlement would be, if they were employed for the whole leave year.</li>
  <li>Establish the number of weeks the worker has worked continuously for you in the annual leave year. Divide that number by 52.</li>
  <li>Multiply the number of days’ annual leave (from step 1) by the answer to step 2. This gives the worker’s reduced annual leave entitlement.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="calculating-holiday-pay">Calculating holiday pay</h3>

<p>If the worker’s pay is the same every week (apart from payments for overtime which is not guaranteed overtime):</p>

<ol>
<li>Establish the worker’s gross contractual weekly pay (excluding pay for voluntary overtime)</li>
  <li>Divide that by the number of days the worker works each week</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives the holiday pay due to the worker for one day of annual leave. You must calculate holiday pay for part of a day of annual leave as a proportion of the amount payable for a full day.</p>

<p>Where the worker’s contractual weekly pay varies, calculate the average gross weekly pay (excluding pay for overtime which is not guaranteed overtime) over a period of 12 weeks. If the worker has been employed for less than 12 weeks, calculate the average gross weekly pay using the actual number of weeks worked.</p>

<p>Then divide the average gross contractual weekly pay by the number of days worked each week. This gives the amount of holiday pay due to the worker for one day of annual leave.</p>

<h3 id="public-holidays-and-bank-holidays">Public holidays and bank holidays</h3>

<p>Where a public holiday or a bank holiday in England and Wales falls on a day when a worker is normally required to work under their contract of employment, then one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the employer does not require the worker to work on that public holiday or bank holiday, that day shall be treated as a day of the worker’s annual leave entitlement</li>
  <li>if the worker does work on the public holiday or bank holiday, they must be paid at the appropriate overtime rate for their grade or category for the hours worked</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="birth-and-adoption-grants-and-agricultural-wages-sick-pay">Birth and adoption grants and agricultural wages sick pay</h2>

<p>All workers are entitled to receive a birth grant from their employer on the birth of their child, and an adoption grant on the adoption of a child. To be eligible for payment of the grant a worker must:</p>

<ul>
<li>be the child’s parent or adoptive parent</li>
  <li>give you a copy of the child’s birth certificate or Adoption Order within three months of the child’s birth or adoption</li>
</ul>
<p>The birth grant and the adoption grant are £60 for each child. Where both parents work for you, both are entitled to receive the grant.</p>

<h3 id="agricultural-wages-sick-pay">Agricultural wages sick pay</h3>

<p><abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr> is a scheme where workers receive at least the appropriate minimum wage for their normal working hours when they are off work sick. This includes any statutory sick pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) they may be entitled to.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/helpsheets/e14.pdf">download a guide on what to do if your employees are sick from the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) website (PDF, 495K)</a>.</p>

<p>Sickness is defined as any illness - or time spent recovering from an operation caused by an illness - as well as any injury that occurred at work or when travelling to and from work, or time spent recovering from an operation due to such an injury. It does not include injuries that did not occur at work or travelling to and from work.</p>

<p>To be entitled to <abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr>, workers must have been working continuously for you for 52 weeks and must immediately tell you about their sickness. They must also give you written evidence - ie a medical statement - if the illness lasts for eight days or more.</p>

<p>A period of absence for <abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr> is a period of four or more days away from work because of sickness. It starts on the first full working day of being unable to work and ends on the day before the worker is fit to go back to work. This can be any day including days that are not normal working days.</p>

<p>The maximum number of days of <abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr> entitlement varies according to the length of time that the worker has been continuously employed when their current <abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr> period commences. This is the 12 month period which starts on the first day of sickness or injury that qualifies for payment of <abbr title="Agricultural wages sick pay">AWSP</abbr>.</p>
