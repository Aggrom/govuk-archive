<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Dual-Use items are those goods and technology that may have both civil and military applications. There are 16 available Dual-Use Open General Export Licences (<abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr>) that allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter (listed left).</p>

<p>Use of these <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr> removes the need to apply for a Standard Individual Export Licence (<abbr title="Standard Individual Export Licence">SIEL</abbr>). However, exporters must ensure all conditions are met and shipment and destinations are eligible. Exporters will be subject to regular compliance visits.</p>

<p>In addition to these <abbr title="Open General Export Licences">OGELs</abbr>, published by the the UK government, you might be able to use the Community General Export Licence (<abbr title="Community General Export Licence">CGEA</abbr>) published by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. </p>

<h2 id="ogel-international-non-proliferation-regime-de-controls-dual-use-items">
<abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> (International Non-Proliferation Regime De-controls: Dual-Use Items)</h2>

<p>This <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> allows, subject to certain conditions, the export of specified dual-use items. </p>

<p>The international non-proliferation regimes (in which the UK actively participates along with other countries) have agreed that the items specifically listed on the licence should be de-controlled.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Open General Export Licence">OGEL</abbr> is therefore intended as a temporary measure placing the specified items under a less restricted form of licensing until such time as the Regulation and the associated UK Strategic Export Control Lists are updated.</p>

<h3 id="background-aboutcontrols-on-dual-use-items">Background about controls on dual-use items </h3>

<p>The control on the export of dual-use items is applied via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Dual-Use Regulation. This is currently being amended to take into account changes agreed by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States in the international non-proliferation regimes during 2011 and will be reflected in amendments to the UK Strategic Export Control Lists in due course.</p>

<p>To be aware of when the Control Lists are updated you can sign up to the <abbr title="Export Control Organisation">ECO</abbr>’s Notices to Exporters email service, as detailed below.</p>
