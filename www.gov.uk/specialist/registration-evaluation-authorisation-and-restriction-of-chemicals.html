<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you use, supply or manufacture chemical substances, or import them from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you need to find out what duties you have under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>) Regulation. Make sure you know what you must do and when.</p>

<p><abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> aims to protect human health and the environment through the control of chemical substances. Most businesses use chemicals in some way, so <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> is likely to affect you.</p>

<p><abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> applies to a wide range of chemical substances, and chemicals in preparations or mixtures including coatings, pigments, dyes, inks and cleaning products. It also applies to chemical substances contained in finished products or articles, whether you are manufacturing or supplying them within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, or importing them from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>This guide explains who <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> applies to and the different responsibilities that apply to manufacturers, importers, distributors and users of chemicals.</p>

<h2 id="does-the-reach-regulation-apply-to-your-business">Does the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> Regulation apply to your business?</h2>

<p>If you use, supply or manufacture chemical substances, or import them from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must comply with the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> Regulation.</p>

<p>If you manufacture or import chemical substances into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in quantities of more than one tonne per calendar year, you may have to register them. You will be committing an offence if you do not pre-register or register chemical substances covered by <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>, unless the substance is exempt.</p>

<p>Other requirements of <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> can affect you regardless of the quantity or your role in the supply chain. For example, if you supply or use certain chemical substances which could be particularly harmful to human health or the environment, you will have to meet certain requirements under <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>. See the page in this guide on substances of very high concern and restricted chemicals.</p>

<h3 id="substances-that-reach-applies-to">Substances that <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> applies to</h3>

<p><abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> applies to most chemical substances, either on their own or in preparations or mixtures. It is not limited to industrial chemicals and includes chemicals used in day-to-day life. Preparations or mixtures include:</p>

<ul>
<li>coatings, eg paints, varnishes or enamels</li>
  <li>pigments, dyes or inks</li>
  <li>cleaning products</li>
  <li>photographic processing chemicals</li>
  <li>chemicals used to produce manmade fibres</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> also applies to chemicals contained in some finished products, known as articles. You must comply with <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> if you manufacture or supply articles within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, or are importing articles from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/guidance.pdf">Download information on <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> and articles from the Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website (PDF, 97KB).</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> may also apply to a chemical substance you recover from waste in quantities of one tonne or more per calendar year. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/waste.pdf">Download <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> guidance on chemical substances recovered from waste from the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website (PDF, 100KB).</a></p>

<p>Some chemical substances are partially or completely exempt from <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/exemptions.pdf">Download <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> exemptions guidance from the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website (PDF, 129KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="how-reach-is-enforced">How <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> is enforced</h3>

<p>The European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>) manages registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction processes for chemical substances across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>In the UK the competent authority for administering <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> is the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>. The competent authority’s responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing advice to UK businesses on <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>
</li>
  <li>enforcing compliance</li>
  <li>working with the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several regulators monitor and enforce the different duties under <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>. This depends on the chemical, your business type and part of the UK you operate in. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/regime.htm#a4">Find out which <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> regulator you need to speak to on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You can email the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> compliance team for specific queries about <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> compliance at <a href="mailto:reachcompliance@hse.gsi.gov.uk">reachcompliance@hse.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="manufacturers-and-importers-of-chemicals-reach-responsibilities">Manufacturers and importers of chemicals: <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> responsibilities</h2>

<p>If you manufacture or import into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> one tonne or more of a chemical substance in a calendar year, you must register it with the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>. This applies to chemical substances on their own, in preparations or mixtures, and may also apply to finished products or articles.</p>

<p>Some substances are exempt from registration under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>) Regulation.</p>

<p>The deadline for registering chemicals under <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> depends on the type of substance and the quantities you are manufacturing or importing.</p>

<p>You will need to fully register both:</p>

<ul>
<li>existing substances, known as phase-in substances, which are generally those substances already on the market</li>
  <li>new or non phase-in substances, which don’t meet the criteria for a phase-in substance</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of phase-in substances are those listed in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances (<abbr title="Existing Commercial Chemical Substances">EINECS</abbr>). Some other substances may also be phase-in substances, including no-longer polymers. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/preregistration.htm">Find a full definition of a phase-in substance on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="make-an-inventory">Make an inventory</h3>

<p>You should make an inventory or list of the chemical substances that your business uses, supplies, manufactures or imports. This will help you understand your responsibilities and the impact <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> will have on your business activities.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/inventorydownstream.pdf">Download guidance on creating an inventory from the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website (PDF, 97KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="registering-pre-registered-phase-in-substances">Registering pre-registered phase-in substances</h3>

<p>If you pre-registered chemicals with <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> as a manufacturer or importer before 1 December 2008, you must fully register by the relevant key deadline.</p>

<p>If you missed this pre-registration deadline, you cannot continue to produce or import the substance until you have registered it with <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>. You should contact the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> compliance team immediately. Email the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> compliance team at <a href="mailto:reachcompliance@hse.gsi.gov.uk">reachcompliance@hse.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The first full registration deadline was 1 December 2010 for any chemicals you manufacture or import in quantities of either:</p>

<ul>
<li>1,000 tonnes or more per year</li>
  <li>100 tonnes or more if the chemical is considered very toxic to aquatic organisms</li>
  <li>One tonne or more if the substance is carcinogenic or a reproductive toxin</li>
</ul>
<p>If you missed this first full registration deadline you should contact the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> compliance team immediately.</p>

<p>You must register chemicals online and submit data using the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>-IT application. <a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/reachit_en.asp">Find information on the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>-IT application on the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>If you manufacture or import into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> more than 10 tonnes of a chemical substance in a year, you may need to carry out a chemical safety assessment. You must produce a chemical safety report to show the results of your assessment and submit it to <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> as part of your registration application. <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> specifies that your safety assessment must include a:</p>

<ul>
<li>human health hazard assessment</li>
  <li>human health hazard assessment of physicochemical properties</li>
  <li>environmental hazard assessment</li>
  <li>persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (<abbr title="persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic assessment">PBT</abbr>), and very persistent and very bioaccumulative (<abbr title="very persistent and very bioaccumulative assessment">VPVB</abbr>) assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>For some substances, you should also carry out an:</p>

<ul>
<li>exposure assessment (including a generation of exposure scenarios/or the identification of relevant use and exposure categories)</li>
  <li>exposure estimation</li>
  <li>risk characterisation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pre-register-phase-in-substances-you-manufacture-or-import-for-the-first-time">Pre-register phase-in substances you manufacture or import for the first time</h3>

<p>If you start to manufacture or import into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> one tonne or more of a phase-in substance in a calendar year for the first time after 1 December 2008, you can make a late pre-registration with the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr>. You must do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>no more than six months after you begin to manufacture or import the phase-in substance</li>
  <li>at least one year before the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> full registration deadline for the quantity and type of your chemical</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="registering-non-phase-in-or-new-substances">Registering non phase-in or new substances</h3>

<p>A non phase-in or new substance under <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> is one that doesn’t meet the criteria for a phase-in substance.</p>

<p>The first time you manufacture or import one tonne or more of a new or non phase-in chemical substance within a calendar year, you must register with the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> before you start to manufacture or import it. <a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13632/registration_en.pdf">Download <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> registration guidance from the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> website (PDF, 749KB).</a></p>

<p>You should make an inquiry about whether the substance has previously been registered to the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> before you start to register the substance. This is to enable data sharing with other registrants, particularly data from animal tests.</p>

<h3 id="classify-and-label-chemicals">Classify and label chemicals</h3>

<p>If you manufacture or supply chemical substances, products or mixtures, you must classify and label them according to the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) (<abbr title="Chemicals Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply Regulations">CHIP</abbr>) Regulations before you put them on the market. <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/chip/phrases.htm">Find hazard warning label information on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>You must also classify substances according to the European Community Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures (CLP Regulation). <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/ghs/implications.htm">Find information about the CLP Regulation on the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h2 id="distributors-and-users-of-chemicals-reach-responsibilities">Distributors and users of chemicals: <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> responsibilities</h2>

<p>If you are a chemical user or distributor, you have responsibilities under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>) Regulation. A retailer is a distributor.</p>

<h3 id="selling-and-distributing-chemicals">Selling and distributing chemicals</h3>

<p>If you distribute or sell chemical substances or mixtures which contain hazardous substances you must pass information on to your customers so that they known what the hazards are.</p>

<p>You must provide professional users with a safety data sheet (<abbr title="Safety Data Sheet">SDS</abbr>) if the substance is classified as hazardous.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Safety Data Sheet">SDS</abbr> gives information on how you should handle, store and dispose of chemicals and what to do in the case of an accident.</p>

<p>If you receive a material without an <abbr title="Safety Data Sheet">SDS</abbr>, contact your supplier to find out whether or not they have to provide one.</p>

<p>If the substance needs to be pre-registered or registered under <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>, you must check this before you start to supply or distribute the substance.</p>

<p>If you are a distributor, you may need to register substances under <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> if you import them from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, on their own, in preparations or mixtures or in articles.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/distributors.pdf">Download guidance on the chemical distributor’s role in <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> from the Health &amp; Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website (PDF, 90KB).</a>.</p>

<h3 id="using-chemicals">Using chemicals</h3>

<p>You are a chemical user if, as a part of your work, you use:</p>

<ul>
<li>any chemicals, preparations or mixtures</li>
  <li>chemicals to formulate or blend preparations or mixtures</li>
  <li>any chemicals, preparations or mixtures to produce articles (finished products)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a chemical substance you must make sure that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify and follow all appropriate safety measures identified by the chemical’s <abbr title="Safety Data Sheet">SDS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>only use the substance in a way that is covered by exposure scenarios contained in the <abbr title="Safety Data Sheet">SDS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>comply with any restrictions or conditions of authorisation that have been placed on its use</li>
</ul>
<p>You should check that your suppliers register all the ways you use the chemicals they supply. This is to make sure that your supply of chemicals will not be disrupted. This may not be necessary if you only use the chemical in the way your supplier intended.</p>

<p>If you have an unusual use for a substance, you should provide your suppliers with details of how you intend to use the chemical. This will allow them to include this information in their registration.</p>

<p>You can choose not to give your suppliers this information if you feel it will compromise your business. In this case you must carry out your own chemical safety assessment. You will normally have to provide this information to the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> and any final users of the chemical.</p>

<p>You should make an inventory or list of chemical substances that your business uses, supplies, manufactures or imports. This will help you understand your responsibilities, what you need to do and the impact <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> will have on your business activities.</p>

<h3 id="controls-on-supplying-and-using-certain-chemicals">Controls on supplying and using certain chemicals</h3>

<p><abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> places controls on the supply and use of certain chemical substances that cause harm to human health or to the environment.</p>

<p>If you supply or use a chemical substance, on its own, in preparations or mixtures or in articles, you must make sure that you meet any specific controls that apply to it.</p>

<h2 id="reach-substances-of-very-high-concern-and-restricted-chemicals">
<abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>: substances of very high concern and restricted chemicals</h2>

<p>The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (<abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>) Regulation places controls on the supply and use of certain chemical substances on their own, in preparations or mixtures, or in articles (finished products). These controls apply to substances that can be particularly harmful to human health or the environment.</p>

<p>There are three groups of chemicals that are specifically controlled under <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>the candidate list of substances of very high concern (<abbr title="Substances of very high concern">SVHC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Annex XIV substances - priority SVHCs from the candidate list that require an authorisation for their supply and use</li>
  <li>Annex XVII restricted substances - particular hazardous substances that have controls on how they can be supplied or used</li>
</ul>
<p>A substance can be subject to control in any or all of the groups.</p>

<h3 id="svhc-and-annex-xiv-substance-controls">
<abbr title="Substances of very high concern">SVHC</abbr> and Annex XIV substance controls</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> has produced a candidate list of possible SVHCs and a recommended list of substances to be included in Annex XIV:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="external" href="http://echa.europa.eu/chem_data/authorisation_process/candidate_list_table_en.asp">find a list of SVHCs on the <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> website</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If you deal with candidate SVHCs or Annex XIV substances your <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> obligations apply to any quantity or weight.</p>

<p>If you supply an article containing a substance on the <abbr title="Substances of very high concern">SVHC</abbr> candidate list at a concentration of 0.1 per cent or more you must give information to professional recipients on the substance and how to use it safely. If anyone requests information on the <abbr title="Substances of very high concern">SVHC</abbr> content of an article, you must provide it to them within 45 days and free of charge.</p>

<p>If you supply a substance on its own or in a preparation or mixture you must provide professional users with a safety data sheet if the substance is classified as hazardous.</p>

<p>Depending on which substance and the amount you supply, you may also need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>submit a notification to <abbr title="European Chemicals Agency">ECHA</abbr> by June 2011</li>
  <li>get an authorisation for specific uses for that substance if it appears in Annex XIV</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="annex-xvii-substance-restrictions">Annex XVII substance restrictions</h3>

<p>Annex XVII of <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> lists restricted chemicals with details of their restrictions and concentration limits. These chemicals are restricted to protect workers, consumers and the environment.</p>

<p>Restrictions may be applied to any substance, including those that do not require registration. Restrictions apply to Annex XVII substances regardless of what quantity or weight of the chemical your business deals with.</p>

<p>If a chemical is listed in Annex XVII, and you supply or use it on its own, in preparations or mixtures, or in articles, you must make sure that you comply with the conditions of the restriction.</p>

<p>If a chemical is listed in Annex XVII you must not:</p>

<ul>
<li>supply or use the chemical for the restrictions outlined</li>
  <li>allow or cause anyone else to break a restriction outlined</li>
</ul>
<p>A restriction may limit the concentration of a chemical for a particular use, or ban a use entirely.</p>

<p>Restricted chemicals include:</p>

<ul>
<li>lead carbonates</li>
  <li>lead sulphates</li>
  <li>benzene</li>
  <li>pentachlorophenol</li>
  <li>nonylphenol and its ethoxylates</li>
  <li>cadmium</li>
  <li>hexachloroethane</li>
  <li>creosote</li>
  <li>compounds containing mercury and arsenic</li>
</ul>
<p>Annex XVII of <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> is subject to change. You should check it regularly to keep up to date with restrictions on the chemicals you are involved with.</p>

<p>To find Annex XVII, search the European law database using the terms ‘<abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr>’ with ‘Annex XVII’ and ensure ‘Title’ is selected under Options. <a rel="external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/SuiteLegislation.do?T1=V111&amp;T2=V1&amp;T3=V1&amp;RechType=RECH_legislation&amp;Submit=Search">Find the European law database on the Europa website.</a></p>

<p>If you want to start using alternative chemicals you should check to make sure that they are not also likely to become restricted.</p>

<p>If you need to check any chemical and the restrictions on it, you should contact the UK competent authority at the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> to find out which regulator you need to speak to. You can email the <abbr title="Registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals">REACH</abbr> Helpdesk at <a href="mailto:UKREACHCA@hse.gsi.gov.uk">UKREACHCA@hse.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>
