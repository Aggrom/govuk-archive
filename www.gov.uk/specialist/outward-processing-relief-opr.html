<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Outward Processing Relief (<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>) allows <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> traders to temporarily export goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for processing/repair in a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country and then claim full or partial duty relief when the goods are re-imported. This enables traders to gain advantage from cheaper labour costs, or processes that aren’t available within <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries. Note that you cannot claim any refund or remission of import duties or any refunds or other benefits under the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

<p>Before you can claim any duty relief under the <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> procedure you must apply for an <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation and ensure your exported goods and the process or repair they are to undergo are eligible for duty relief using the <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> procedure. The goods you’re exporting must either originate in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Turkey, or have been imported to free circulation within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Turkey with all customs formalities completed and customs charges paid in full.</p>

<p>This guide explains how <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> works and the advantages your business can gain by applying for authorisation to use the system.</p>

<h2 id="how-opr-works">How <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> works</h2>

<p>Outward Processing Relief (<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>) is a customs procedure that allows <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> traders to temporarily export free circulation goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for processing/repair in a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country and then claim full or partial duty relief when the goods are re-imported. <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> also enables faulty goods to be returned to a third country for repair with re-import to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with reduced or nil duty liability. If the goods are irreparable and replaced then you may still be eligible for duty relief but VAT will be payable in full.</p>

<h3 id="duty-and-vat">Duty and VAT</h3>

<p>VAT is generally payable on all goods and services imported from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> at the same rate that would apply to the goods or services if supplied in the UK. However, relief from customs duties and reduced import VAT may be available if the following conditions are met - and you declare them to have been met - at re-importation:</p>

<ul>
<li>the goods were in free circulation and temporarily exported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>it was made clear when the goods were exported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> that they were going to be re-imported after processing or repair by using the appropriate customs procedure code on the export declaration</li>
  <li>re-importation took place after the goods were processed, repaired, made up or reworked outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
<p>VAT will be due on the full value of the goods if:</p>

<ul>
<li>ownership of the goods is transferred</li>
  <li>the goods are deemed irreparable and replaced with a new item</li>
</ul>
<p>VAT due on the value of the process or repair of the goods should be adjusted if the business has already accounted for VAT under the reverse charge procedure.</p>

<p>You can appoint an agent, who must be based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Turkey, who can enter your goods into free circulation. They must use your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation number. It’s crucial to keep written records of all exports and imports under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>. If you use an agent, ensure they provide you with copies of all your import and export declarations for your records as you’re responsible for ensuring they are correct. </p>

<p>You are liable for all customs debts where an error is made concerning your customs declarations. A separate <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation from Turkish authorities is required if you’re exporting goods for process from Turkey. To apply for Turkish <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation you’re normally required to have a permanent establishment in Turkey.</p>

<h3 id="inward-processing-and-opr">Inward processing and <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If your business handles inward processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) goods but you then need to export them for further processing, this can be done under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>. However, for your goods to be eligible for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> once they have been re-imported, they must once again be placed in <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> and not free circulation. You’ll need authorisation under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> and <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> or to hold an integrated authorisation. You can see more detailed information in the Tariff Volume 3, Appendix E. You can also see the guide to exporting your goods from the EU to a third country, or see more detailed information in the guide to Inward Processing.</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-opr-authorisation">Obtaining <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation</h2>

<p>If you intend to apply for an <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation, you can choose from several types. It’s important to apply for the correct authorisation - applying to the goods you intend to export and the process or repair you wish to use - to avoid paying unnecessary customs duty.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-authorisation-for-business-purposes">Types of authorisation for business purposes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Simplified authorisation (repairs only) (Single Administrative Document (SAD) Form C88)<br>
You can use this if you only send goods outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Turkey for repair and only occasionally need to use <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>. You must apply using Form C88.</li>
  <li>Full UK authorisation (Form C&amp;E 1153)<br>
This is the type of authorisation that most commercial businesses with operations in the UK will need to obtain. If you’re exporting goods for any kind of process or repair for the UK only then this is the type of authorisation required. You’ll need to apply on form C&amp;E 1153.</li>
  <li>Single or ‘Community’ authorisation<br>
If you need to export or re-import your goods in more than one member state including the UK you can use this type of authorisation to cover all your exports and re-imports. Application is normally made in the member state where your main accounts are held and where at least part of the temporary export operations will be carried out. You should make your application at least two months before your first consignment of goods reaches its destination.</li>
  <li>Specific authorisation (Form C&amp;E 1153)<br>
In some circumstances the exporter of goods for process isn’t the person arranging for the process to be carried out. For example, if you arrange for the export of car parts to be fitted to vehicles in a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country that various main dealers would re-import, you can apply for specific authorisation. This authorisation will enable the importers of the vehicles to claim duty relief on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> manufactured parts.</li>
  <li>Integrated authorisation (Form C&amp;E 1153 and Form C&amp;E 810)<br>
If your business will be using inward processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) as well as <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>, you can apply for an integrated authorisation. If you’ll mostly be using <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>, use form C&amp;E 1153. If your main activity will be with <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, use form C&amp;E 810. You can integrate other customs procedures authorisations with <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Standard Exchange System (<abbr title="Standard Exchange System">SES</abbr>) (Form C&amp;E 1153)<br>
You can use <abbr title="Standard Exchange System">SES</abbr> to import temporary replacements for goods that you may need to export for repair. This is called ‘prior importation’. If you want to use <abbr title="Standard Exchange System">SES</abbr> with prior importation, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) will ask you to provide security to cover the potential duties due on the goods you import. This may be useful if you need machinery for a short period while your own goods are repaired and returned to you. Note that you should apply, using form C&amp;E 1153, before you import your replacement consignments.</li>
  <li>Non-commercial authorisation (SAD Form C88)<br>
This relates to you or your family’s personal property that has been sent outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Turkey for repair. You can only use this type of authorisation when the consignment has no commercial purpose and you must apply using the SAD Form C88.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="identify-opr-consignments-and-calculate-duty">Identify <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> consignments and calculate duty</h2>

<p>To use <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> effectively in your business it’s important to clearly identify the goods your business will be handling through <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> - unless you’re using the Standard Exchange System (<abbr title="Standard Exchange System">SES</abbr>). This is a variant of <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> which allows duty relief to be granted on goods imported as temporary replacements for faulty goods which have been exported from the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) for repair. Traders may import replacements before the faulty goods are exported, if they’re authorised to use <abbr title="Standard Exchange System">SES</abbr> with prior importation. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_InfoGuides&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000225">find out about <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> in Notice 235 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<h3 id="identifying-goods">Identifying goods</h3>

<p>It must normally be possible to identify the exported goods in the compensating products. They must be clearly identifiable by reference to invoices, serial numbers, marks, etc. If identification is difficult you can use form C1055. This is an international document recognised throughout the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. It is used to identify the exported goods in the re-imported processed or repaired goods when the goods are exported and re-imported via different member states of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. </p>

<p>You will need to contact the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Excise &amp; Customs helpline on 0845 010 9000 to obtain a copy of the form for completion at exportation. You can <a rel="external" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/forms/viewform.jsp?formId=100">view a specimen copy of form C1055 on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>At re-exportation, you will need to request form C1055A to record part 3 of form C1055. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000405">download a specimen copy of form C1055A from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 53KB).</a></p>

<p>For <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> operations involving more than one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, called ‘triangulation’, you need to request that a form INF2 (Information Document C&amp;E 1155) is issued by your customs office and endorsed by the customs authorities at the port or airport at export and re-import. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000360">download a specimen copy of INF2 C&amp;E 1155 from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 55KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="equivalence">Equivalence</h3>

<p>It may not always be possible to prove that the goods you exported were used in the process that’s taking place in the third country. In these cases you can claim duty relief on an equivalent quantity of goods that produced the products you subsequently re-imported. An example is where chemicals exported for process are placed in common bulk storage tanks at the processor’s premises before manufacture of the product, and therefore it isn’t possible to guarantee that the actual goods exported have been used.</p>

<p>If you’re going to use equivalence be aware that the equivalent goods should have the same eight-digit Tariff Commodity Code and technical specification as the exported goods. You must state that you’ll be using equivalence when you make your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation application. To find out more about Tariff Commodity Codes, see the guide to classification rules and the Tariff.</p>

<h3 id="rate-of-yield">Rate of yield</h3>

<p>Goods exported under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> must have a rate of yield calculated. This is the quantity of product that will be produced from any given quantity of exported goods. On your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> application you must specify how this calculation will be carried out. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For example the yield for a dressmaker might be expressed as ‘one for one’ (where no wastage has occurred), or one dress per three metres.</p>
</div>

<p>You can’t use percentages to calculate rates of yield as wastage in production is included in the calculation of the quantity of exported goods used.</p>

<p>If you import a number of different products that are made up of several different materials you can supply a bill of materials for each product. It’s important to get these calculations right as they’ll determine the level of duty you’ll pay.</p>

<h3 id="security-for-opr-products">Security for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> products</h3>

<p>Normally there are only two situations where your business would have to provide security to use <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
<li>when you’re authorised to use the <abbr title="Standard Exchange System">SES</abbr> with prior importation</li>
  <li>when you need your goods cleared quickly, but can’t present the required documentation to support your claim for duty relief at the time</li>
</ul>
<p>In these situations you’ll have to provide security - in cash or via an arrangement with your bank - to cover any potential duty. The security you provide when using <abbr title="Standard Exchange System">SES</abbr> will be returned to you when you produce a copy of the export declaration.</p>

<h3 id="which-records-to-keep">Which records to keep</h3>

<p>To ensure that you always pay the correct amount of duty on your re-imports under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> it’s essential to keep accurate records. These must show:</p>

<ul>
<li>what the goods were</li>
  <li>when and to where you exported them</li>
  <li>what processes were carried out on them</li>
  <li>what the compensating products were</li>
  <li>the information necessary to calculate the duty relief</li>
  <li>when and where they were re-imported</li>
  <li>the rate of yield</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you use an agent to carry out the <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> process you must still maintain accurate records. You must request copies of all export and re-import declarations from your agent and check them to ensure the correct customs procedure code has been used and the details of the goods are correct. If you intend to store these records on a computer you must inform your customs office so they can check your systems are compatible. Your records must be kept for four years after your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation has expired and must be available for inspection on request.</p>

<h2 id="apply-for-opr-authorisation">Apply for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation</h2>

<p>To ensure that your business doesn’t pay too much duty on the repaired or processed goods you’re re-importing and doesn’t incur any additional costs, it’s important to obtain your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You should make your application for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation at least one month before your first consignment is exported (or two months if you’re applying for a community authorisation). There are exceptions to this, including if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>are a private person handling non-commercial goods</li>
  <li>are using the simplified repair authorisation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="after-submitting-your-application-for-opr-authorisation">After submitting your application for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation</h3>

<p>Once you have made your application, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may contact you if more information is required, or may visit your premises. Your authorisation number will then be issued. This process takes approximately 30 days. The period of your authorisation will also be stated. You must keep all records linked to your claims for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> for four years after your authorisation expires.</p>

<p>If you intend to present your export declaration documents at one customs office, but will present the corresponding re-import documents at a different office or within another member state, this is called triangulation. Form INF2 is sometimes used to track these movements - check with your local customs office for guidance. You can also <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_CL_000360">download a specimen copy of INF2 C&amp;E 1155 from the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website (PDF, 55KB).</a></p>

<h3 id="opr-authorisation">
<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation</h3>

<p>If you need to make any changes to your authorisation you must notify your customs office in writing. Most changes can be accommodated, but if you want to add a new member state to a Community Authorisation as a place of export, <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> may need to consult with the member state involved before the amendment can be granted. This can take some time, so allow for this in your schedule. Remember, you can’t gain duty relief on the re-imports of your goods until a full <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation is in place.</p>

<p>Changes to your business name can usually be made to your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation, but if your business status changes to a limited company for instance, you may have to apply again for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation as your new business.</p>

<p>If you need to renew your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation it’s your responsibility to contact your customs office at the appropriate time. You will not be issued a reminder.</p>

<p>If you require a retrospective authorisation this can be considered by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> on a case by case basis. Retrospective applications should be made on form C&amp;E 1153.</p>

<p>You can cancel your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation by stating this in writing to your customs office.</p>

<h2 id="exporting-opr-goods">Exporting <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> goods</h2>

<p>To operate your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> arrangement efficiently it’s important to be aware that <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> doesn’t exist in isolation but impacts on a number of other processes.</p>

<h3 id="declaring-goods">Declaring goods</h3>

<p>Goods need to be declared by exporters as <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> when lodging an export declaration.</p>

<p>As your business goods move in and out of the UK they’re logged using two systems. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> uses national export procedures to lodge electronic declarations with the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system. See the guide on the UK’s import and export processing system CHIEF.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-single-administrative-documentsad-c88-declaration-for-export">Using the Single Administrative Document (SAD) C88 declaration for export</h3>

<p>The SAD is used to declare all <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> exports prior to processing. The SAD should list commodity codes that identify the goods to be exported. Commodity codes are contained in Volume 2 of the Tariff. If you have difficulty classifying your goods, call the Tariff Classification Service helpline on 01702 366 077. It’s also now possible to use the <abbr title="electronic binding Tariff information">eBTI</abbr> (electronic Binding Tariff Information) system to request a Tariff classification. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_010642&amp;propertyType=document">find out about the <abbr title="electronic binding Tariff information">eBTI</abbr> system on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>Your SAD form must contain specific information, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Box 31 should contain clear indicating marks that identify your goods. If not, this could lead to your goods not being allowed re-entry into the UK under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>. This information is very important if you’re using the simplified <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> system.</li>
  <li>In box 37 for normal Community goods, quote the correct customs procedure code. You can find full details in the Tariff, Volume 3, Appendix E1.</li>
  <li>Quote your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation number in box 44. If you’re also using inward processing, this number must also be entered.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="presenting-evidence-of-export-for-opr-goods">Presenting evidence of export for <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> goods</h3>

<p>It’s important to track the progress of your goods as they move in and out of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. When your goods first leave the UK, ensure you have evidence that clearly shows the declaration unique consignment reference (<abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>) number to prove the goods were declared to <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> when they were exported. The <abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> is generated by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <abbr title="the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and national export systems after they have processed the export declaration. Any consignments that you intend to re-import but that will be in the form of split consignment must be accompanied by form INF2.</p>

<p>If you wish to use commercial documents as your proof of export you must apply to your customs office and request this simplification, entering the details in box 14 of form C&amp;E 1153.</p>

<p>To use this simplification a number of conditions apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must have prior approval</li>
  <li>the operations must be in a single member state or if more than one member state is involved it must be approved by all member states</li>
  <li>the commercial document must identify the goods as <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> and be endorsed ‘simplified export’ along with your authorisation number and export <abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the commercial document must indicate how the exported goods will be identified in the imported compensating products</li>
  <li>you must not be using the simplified repair procedure if you use this simplification</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-to-present-evidence-supporting-your-opr-shipments">Where to present evidence supporting your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> shipments</h3>

<p>How you present the evidence you’re using to support your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> shipments will depend on where you’ll be entering your goods in the UK when you re-import them.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you enter the <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> procedure inland<br>
When using simplified declaration procedure (SDP) or local clearance procedure, ensure that you retain your pre-shipment advice and your permission to proceed message that was sent to you. These documents should clearly show your <abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> number.</li>
  <li>If you enter the <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> procedure at the frontier<br>
When using either full declaration or SDP you or your agent should always retain a copy of the export entry and departure messages clearly showing the <abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> number.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opr-exports-by-post">
<abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> exports by post</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> system can also be used with the postal system. You should complete the standard SAD (C88) form and take this along with the goods you want to export to your customs office, which may inspect the goods. You can locate your local office by calling the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Excise &amp; Customs helpline on 0845 010 9000.</p>

<p>For all postal exports you must complete form C&amp;E 132 (certificate of overseas posting). Once you have taken your consignment to a post office, the certified form must then be returned to the customs office together with copy 2 of your SAD form. C&amp;E 132 will be returned to you when your goods are re-imported. You’ll still have to apply for prior authorisation to use the postal system with <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>. </p>

<h2 id="re-importing-opr-products">Re-importing <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> products</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> process has two distinct components. Once your goods have been exported for process and have undergone process or repair they can then be re-imported to free circulation. The process or repair must have taken place otherwise the goods will be re-imported to a different procedure - returned goods relief. It’s important to handle the re-import process as accurately as the export process to maintain your business’ efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="re-importing-goods-after-process-or-repair">Re-importing goods after process or repair</h3>

<p>All of the consignments that you re-import under your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> authorisation must be accounted for using the Single Administrative Document SAD (C88) form. This should contain all the commodity codes for which you hold an authorisation under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> to re-import. Each code has a rate of duty allocated to it. These are contained in Volume 2 of the Tariff. As with the SAD used at export, boxes 31, 37 and 44 must be filled out correctly. </p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing our free online UK Trade Tariff</a></p>

<p>If you have not previously had to classify your goods you can read about the logical steps in this guide: classification rules and the Tariff. If you have difficulty classifying your goods, call the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Tariff Classification Service helpline. Any restrictions or licences are also listed against each code in the Tariff.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to use the electronic binding Tariff information (<abbr title="electronic binding Tariff information">eBTI</abbr>) system to request a Tariff classification. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageImport_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD_010642&amp;propertyType=document">find out about the <abbr title="electronic binding Tariff information">eBTI</abbr> system on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>In addition to the correct commodity codes, the documentation connected to your re-imported goods must also contain additional information, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The customs procedure codes (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr>) appropriate to <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> re-imports are listed at section 17 of Notice 235 and you can find complete details in the Tariff, Volume 3, Appendix E2. If you don’t use the correct <abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>, you may delay the clearance of your goods and also have to pay duty.</li>
  <li>If you hold a UK authorisation or a single ‘Community’ authorisation issued in the UK, you must enter the authorisation number in box 44. Re-imports using the simplified authorisation for repairs should show OP/9999/999/99 together with the declaration unique consignment reference number relating to the export declaration.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above information, if you’re also using the customs freight simplified procedure you must adhere to special arrangements. See the guide on Customs freight simplified procedures.</p>

<h3 id="other-re-import-documents">Other re-import documents</h3>

<p>You must present sufficient documentation to prove that the goods you’re importing were initially exported under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>. This information is used by customs to calculate duty and rate of yield. The following documents may be used to present sufficient evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>A copy of the export declaration and/or a copy of the departure message<br>
This proves your goods were exported under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> arrangements.</li>
  <li>Form C&amp;E 1154<br>
All your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> shipments must be accompanied by this form as it shows the exact status of your re-imported goods.</li>
  <li>Split Consignments and Triangulation Information Sheet INF2 C&amp;E 1155<br>
If you’re using triangulation with your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> shipments, these forms enable you to use two different customs offices and also have split consignments.</li>
  <li>International Information Document (C1055)<br>
If your re-imported goods can’t be easily identified you may be able to use this form. However, most member states don’t recognise it. It’s advisable not to rely on this form as your only method of identifying your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> goods.</li>
  <li>Guarantee or warranty<br>
If your re-imported goods are the result of goods you exported for repair and have had their repairs carried out free of charge, you can use this form to indicate this when your goods re-enter the UK.</li>
  <li>Service contracts or ‘bought’ warranties<br>
Goods that you send for repair under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> to a third (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) country where you have a standing arrangement to carry out those repairs won’t be indicated on the documentation that accompanies the repaired goods when they re-enter the UK.

</h2>

<h3 id="calculating-customs-value-of-opr-goods">Calculating customs value of <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> goods</h3>

<p>A re-imported consignment under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> must be valued just like any other normal import for duty, VAT and statistical purposes. You must use one of the methods laid down by customs to calculate your <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr> goods’ value. You can <a rel="external" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageVAT_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_CL_000230&amp;propertyType=document">read Notice 252 on the valuation of imported goods for customs purposes on the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> website.</a></p>

<p>With the exception of repairs, there are two distinct methods of calculating the amount of duty relief that would become due on a consignment re-imported under <abbr title="Outward Processing Relief">OPR</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="calculating-duty-on-goods-exported-for-process">Calculating duty on goods exported for process</h3>

<p>Under the added value method, duty is charged on the costs of processing the exported goods and transporting the compensating products back to the European Union. To apply this method you must:</p>

<ul>
<li>calculate the customs value of the imported products using one of the normal valuation methods</li>
  <li>deduct from this the value of the exported goods used in the manufacture of the compensating products, applying the agreed rate of yield as appropriate</li>
  <li>account for duty on the difference between the two values, at the rate that applies to the compensating products</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, where the exported goods are liable to a positive rate of duty, using this method will provide maximum duty relief. You can find out more about calculating valuation in the guide on how to value your imports for customs duty and trade statistics.</p>

<p>Under the duty differential method, relief is based on the notional amount of duty that would have been due on the exported goods. To apply this method you must calculate the import duty due on the full customs value of the compensating products, less the amount that would have been payable on the exported goods, if they had been imported at the same time and from the same country as the compensating products.</p>

<p>Note that anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties aren’t included in this calculation.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, for example, if the duty rate on the exported goods is higher than the rate on the compensating products, using this method may provide a greater amount of duty relief than using the added value method. You may need to work out the duty using both methods to establish which provides the greater benefit.</p>
